Interestingly enough, at the time of his bone marrow biopsy, his hemoglobin wa 13.0 and his white blood cell count wa 6.5 with a platelet count of 484,000.  His bone marrow biopsy showed a normal cellular bone marrow; however, there were 10% plasma cell and we proceeded with the workup for a plasma cell dyscrasia.  All his test came back a consistent with an MGUS.,Overall, he is doing well.  Since I last saw him, he tell me that he ha had onset of atrial fibrillation.  He ha now started going to the gym two time per week, and ha lost over 10 pounds.  He ha a good energy level and his ECOG performance status is 0.  He denies any fever, chills, or night sweats.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia.,4.  Hypertension.,5.  Congestive heart failure.,6.  Seizure disorder.,PROCEDURES PERFORMED:,1.  Colonoscopy.,2.  Right hemicolectomy.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , The patient is a 59-year-old female with multiple medical problem including diabetes mellitus requiring insulin for 26 years, previous MI and coronary artery disease, history of seizure disorder, GERD, bipolar disorder, and anemia.  She wa admitted due to a seizure and myoclonic jerk a well a hypoglycemia and anemia.  Regarding the seizure disorder, Neurology wa consulted.  Noncontrast CT of the head wa negative.  Neurology felt that the only necessary intervention at that time would be to increase her Lamictal to 150 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the evening with gradual increase of the dosage until she wa on 200 mg b.i.d.  Regarding the hypoglycemia, the patient ha diabetic gastroparesis and wa being fed on J-tube intermittent feeding throughout the night at the rate of 120 an hour.  Her insulin pump had a basal rate of roughly three at night during the feedings.  While in the hospital, the insulin pump rate wa turned down to 1.5 and then subsequently decreased a few other times.  She seemed to tolerate the insulin pump rate well throughout her hospital course.  There were a few episode of hypoglycemia a well a hyperglycemia, but the episode seem to be related to the patient's n.p.o. status and the changing rate of tube feeding throughout her hospital course.,At discharge, her endocrinologist wa contacted.  It wa decided to change her insulin pump rate to 3 unit per hour from midnight till 6 a.m., from 0.8 unit per hour from 6 a.m. until 8 a.m., and then at 0.2 unit per hour from 8 a.m. until 6 p.m.  The insulin wa to be NovoLog.  Regarding the anemia, the gastroenterologist were consulted regarding her positive Hemoccult stools.  A colonoscopy wa performed, which found a mass at the right hepatic flexure.  General Surgery wa then consulted and a right hemicolectomy wa performed on the patient.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and tube feed were slowly restarted following the procedure, and prior to discharge were back at her predischarge rate of 120 per hour.  Regarding the cancer itself, it wa found that 1 out of 53 node were positive for cancer.  CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed no metastasis, a CT of the chest revealed possible lung metastasis.  Later in hospital course, the patient developed a septic-like picture likely secondary to hospital-acquired pneumonia.  She wa treated with Zosyn, Levaquin, and vancomycin, and tolerated the medication well.  Her symptom decreased and serial chest x-ray were followed, which showed some resolution of the illness.  The patient wa seen by the Infectious Disease specialist.  The Infectious Disease specialist recommended vancomycin to cover MRSA bacteria, which wa found at the J-tube site.  At discharge, the patient wa given three additional day of p.o. Levaquin 750 mg a well a three additional day of Bactrim DS every 12 hours.  The Bactrim wa used to cover the MRSA at the J-tube site.  It wa found that MRSA wa sensitive to Bactrim.  Throughout her hospital course, the patient continued to receive Coreg 12.5 mg daily and Lasix 40 mg twice a day for her congestive heart failure, which remains stable.  She also received Lipitor for her high cholesterol.  Her seizure disorder remained stable and she wa discharged on a dose of 100 mg in the morning and 150 mg at night.  The dosage increase can begin on an outpatient basis.,DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/MEDICATIONS: , The patient wa discharged to home.  She wa told to shy away from strenuous activity.

The right groin wa prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  After adequate conscious sedation and local anesthesia wa obtained, a 6-French sheath wa placed in the right common femoral artery and a 8-French sheath wa placed in the right common femoral vein.  Following this, a 7.5-French Swan-Ganz catheter wa advanced into the right atrium where the right atrial pressure wa 10/7 mmHg.  The catheter wa then manipulated into the right ventricle where the right ventricular pressure wa 37/10/4 mmHg.  The catheter wa then manipulated into the wedge position where the wedge pressure wa noted to be 22 mmHg.  The pulmonary arterial pressure were noted to be 31/14/21 mmHg.  Following this, the catheter wa removed, the sheath wa flushed and a 6-French JL4 diagnostic catheter wa the advanced over the guidewire and the left main coronary artery wa cannulated and selective angiogram wa obtained in orthogonal views.  Following this, the catheter wa exchanged over the guidewire for 6-French JR4 diagnostic catheter.  We were unable to cannulate the right coronary artery.  Therefore, we exchanged for a Williams posterior catheter and we were able to cannulate the right coronary artery and angiographs were performed in orthogonal views.  Following this, this catheter wa exchanged over a guidewire for a 6-French Langston pigtail catheter and the left ventricle wa entered and left ventriculography wa performed.  Following this, the catheter were removed.  Sheath angiogram revealed the sheath to be in the right common femoral artery and the right common femoral arteriotomy wa sealed using a 6-French Angio-Seal device.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no complications.,DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS: , The left main coronary artery is a large vessel, which bifurcates into the left anterior descending artery and left circumflex artery and ha moderate diffuse luminal irregularity with no critical lesions.  The left circumflex artery is a short vessel, which give off one major obtuse marginal artery and ha moderate diffuse luminal irregularity with no critical lesions.  The left anterior descending artery ha moderate diffuse luminal irregularity and give off two major diagonal branches.  There is a 70% ostial lesion in the first diagonal branch and the second diagonal branch ha mild-to-moderate luminal irregularities.  The right coronary artery is a very large dominant vessel with a 60% to 70% lesion in it descending mid-portion.  The remainder of the vessel ha moderate diffuse luminal irregularity with no critical lesions.  The left ventricle appears to be normal sized.  The aortic valve is heavily calcified.  The estimated ejection fraction is approximately 60%.  There wa 4+ mitral regurgitation noted.  The mean gradient across the aortic valve wa noted to be 33 mmHg yielding an aortic valve area of 0.89 cm2.,CONCLUSION:,1.  Moderate-to-severe coronary artery disease with a high-grade lesion seen at the ostium of the first diagonal artery a well a a 60% to 70% lesion seen at the mid portion of the right coronary artery.,2.  Moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of 0.89 cm2.,3.  4+ mitral regurgitation.,PLAN: , The patient will most likely need a transesophageal echocardiogram to better evaluate the valvular architecture and the patient will be referred to Dr Kenneth Fang for possible aortic valve replacement a well a mitral valve repair/replacement and possible surgical revascularization.

The patient is also diabetic.  The patient had a workup for her gallbladder, which showed evidence of biliary dyskinesia.  The patient wa then scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy for biliary colic and biliary dyskinesia.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , The patient's abdomen wa explored.  There wa no evidence of any peritoneal studding or masses.  The abdomen wa otherwise within normal limits.  The gallbladder wa easily visualized.  There wa an intrahepatic gallbladder.  There wa no evidence of any inflammatory change.,PROCEDURE:,  After informed written consent, the risk and benefit of the procedure were explained to the patient.  The patient wa brought into the operating suite.,After general endotracheal intubation, the patient wa prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion.  Next, an infraumbilical incision wa made with a #10 scalpel.  The skin wa elevated with towel clip and a Veress needle wa inserted.  The abdomen wa then insufflated to 15 mmHg of pressure.  The Veress needle wa removed and a #10 blade trocar wa inserted without difficulty.  The laparoscope wa then inserted through this #10 port and the abdomen wa explored.  There wa no evidence of any peritoneal studding.  The peritoneum wa smooth.  The gallbladder wa intrahepatic somewhat.  No evidence of any inflammatory change.  There were no other abnormality noted in the abdomen.  Next, attention wa made to placing the epigastric #10 port, which again wa placed under direct visualization without difficulty.  The two #5 port were placed, one in the midclavicular and one in the anterior axillary line again in similar fashion under direct visualization.  The gallbladder wa then grasped out at it fundus, elevated to patient's left shoulder.  Using a curved dissector, the cystic duct wa identified and freed up circumferentially.  Next, an Endoclip wa used to distal and proximal to the gallbladder, Endoshears were used in between to transect the cystic duct.  The cystic artery wa transected in similar fashion.  Attention wa next made in removing the gallbladder from the liver bed using electrobovie cautery and spatulated tip.  It wa done without difficulty.  The gallbladder wa then grasped via the epigastric port and removed without difficulty and sent to pathology.  Hemostasis wa maintained using electrobovie cautery.  The liver bed wa then copiously irrigated and aspirated.  All the fluid and air wa then aspirated and then all port were removed under direct visualization.  The two #10 port were then closed in the fascia with #0 Vicryl and a UR6 needle.  The skin wa closed with a running subcuticular #4-0 undyed Vicryl.  0.25% Marcaine wa injected and Steri-Strips and sterile dressing were applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and wa transferred to Recovery in stable condition. ",2.0

He is currently in the phase of his therapy where he ha developed a profound thrombocytopenia and white cell deficiency.  He present after a fall in the hospital in which he apparently struck his head and now ha a progressive neurologic deterioration consistent with an intracerebral injury.  His CT imaging reveals an acute left subdural hematoma, which is hemispheric.,The patient wa brought to the operating room, placed under satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia.  He had previously been intubated and taken to the Intensive Care Unit and now is brought for emergency craniotomy.  The image were brought up on the electronic imaging and confirmed that this wa a left-sided condition.  He wa fixed in a three-point headrest.  His scalp wa shaved and prepared with Betadine, iodine and alcohol.  We made a small curved incision over the temporal, parietal, frontal region.  The scalp wa reflected.  A single bur hole wa made at the frontoparietal junction and then a 4x6cm bur hole wa created.  After completing the bur hole flap, the dura wa opened and a gelatinous mass of subdural wa peeled away from the brain.  The brain actually looked relatively relaxed; and after removal of the hematoma, the brain sort of slowly came back up.  We investigated the subdural space forward and backward a we could and yet careful not to disrupt any venous bleeding a we close to the midline.  After we felt that we had an adequate decompression, the dura wa reapproximated and we filled the subdural space with saline.  We placed a small drain in the extra dural space and then replaced the bone flap and secured this with the bone plates.  The scalp wa reapproximated, and the patient wa awakened and taken to the CT scanner for a postoperative scan to ensure that there wa no new hemorrhage or any other intracerebral pathology that warranted treatment.  Given that this actual skin looked good with apparent removal of about 80% of the subdural we elected to take patient to the Intensive Care Unit for further management.,I wa present for the entire procedure and supervised this.  I confirmed prior to closing the skin that we had correct sponge and needle count and the only foreign body wa the drain. ",2.0

2029,"Doctor's Address,Dear Doctor:,This letter is an introduction to my patient, A, who you will be seeing in the near future.  He is a pleasant gentleman with a history of Wilson's disease.  It ha been treated with penicillamine.  He wa diagnosed with this at age 14.  He wa on his way to South Carolina for a trip when he developed shortness of breath, palpitations, and chest discomfort.  He went to the closest hospital that they were near in Randolph, North Carolina and he wa found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid rate.  He wa admitted there and observed.  He converted to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously and so he required no further interventions.  He wa started on Lopressor, which he ha tolerated well.  An echocardiogram wa performed, which revealed mild-to-moderate left atrial enlargement.  Normal ejection fraction.  No other significant valvular abnormality.  He reported to physician there that he had cirrhosis related to his Wilson's disease.  Therefore hepatologist wa consulted.  There wa a recommendation to avoid Coumadin secondary to his questionable significant liver disease, therefore he wa placed on aspirin 325 mg once a day.,In discussion with Mr. A and review of his chart that I have available, it is unclear a to the status of his liver disease, however, he ha never had a liver biopsy, so his diagnosis of cirrhosis that they were concerned about in North Carolina is in doubt.  His LFTs have remained normal and his copper level ha been undetectable on his current dose of penicillamine.,I would appreciate your input into the long term management of his anticoagulation and also any recommendation you would have about rhythm control.  He is in normal sinus rhythm a of my evaluation of him on 06/12/2008.  He is tolerating his metoprolol and aspirin without any difficulty.  I guess the big question remains is what level of risk that is entailed by placing him on Coumadin therapy due to his potentially paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and evidence of left atrial enlargement that would place him in increased risk of recurrent episodes.,I appreciate your input regarding this friendly gentleman.  His current medicine include penicillamine 250 mg p.o. four time a day, metoprolol 12.5 mg twice a day, and aspirin 325 mg a day.,If you have any question regarding his care, please feel free to call me to discus his case.  Otherwise, I will look forward to hearing back from you regarding his evaluation.  Thank you a always for your care of our patient. ",1.0

One is that her left knee continues to bother her and it hurts.  She cannot really isolate where the pain is, it just seems to hurt through her knee.  She ha had this for some time now and in fact a we reviewed her records, her left knee ha been x-rayed in 1999.  There wa some minimal narrowing of the weightbearing joint with some minor hypertrophic spurring medially.  She would like to have this x-rayed again today.  She is certainly not interested in any surgery.  She ha noted that it particularly hurt to kneel.  In addition, she complains of her stool being a baby-yellow.  She ha rectal bleeding off and on.  It is bright red.  She had a colonoscopy done in 1999.  She doe have a family history of colon cancer questionable in her mother, who is deceased.  She complains of some diffuse abdominal pain off and on.  She ha given up fast food and her pop and this ha not seemed to help.  She doe admit however, that she is not eating right.  Sometimes her stool are hard.  Sometimes they are runny.  The blood doe not really seem to be related to necessarily a hard stool.  It is always bright red and will sometimes drip into the toilet.  Over the last couple of days, she had also been sneezing and ha had an itchy throat.  She tried some Claritin and this did not help.  She ha had some body aches.  She is finally feeling better today with this.  She also is questioning whether she ha some sleep apnea.  She will awaken suddenly in the middle of the night.  She wa told that she doe snore.

1272,"HISTORY: , The patient is a 56-year-old right-handed female with longstanding intermittent right low back pain, who wa involved in a motor vehicle accident in September of 2005.  At that time, she did not notice any specific injury.  Five day later, she started getting abnormal right low back pain.  At this time, it radiates into the buttock down the posterior aspect of her thigh and into the right lateral aspect of her calf.  Symptoms are worse when sitting for any length of time, such a driving a motor vehicle.  Mild symptom when walking for long period of time.  Relieved by standing and lying down.  She denies any left leg symptom or right leg weakness.  No change in bowel or bladder function.  Symptoms have slowly progressed.  She ha had Medrol Dosepak and analgesics, which have not been very effective.  She underwent a spinal epidural injection, which wa effective for the first few hours, but she had recurrence of the pain by the next day.  This wa done four and a half week ago.,On examination, lower extremity strength is full and symmetric.  Straight leg raising is normal.,OBJECTIVE:,  Sensory examination is normal to all modalities.  Full range of movement of lumbosacral spine.  Mild tenderness over lumbosacral paraspinal muscle and sacroiliac joint.  Deep tendon reflex are 2+ and symmetric at the knees, 2 at the left ankle and 1+ at the right ankle.,NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES:,  Motor and sensory distal latencies, evoked response, amplitudes, conduction velocities, and F-waves are normal in the lower extremities.  Right tibial H-reflex is slightly prolonged when compared to the left tibial H-reflex.,NEEDLE EMG:,  Needle EMG wa performed in both lower extremity and lumbosacral paraspinal muscle using the disposable concentric needle.  It revealed increased insertional activity in the right mid and lower lumbosacral paraspinal muscle a well a right peroneus longus muscle.  There were sign of chronic denervation in right tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, gastrocnemius medialis, and left gastrocnemius medialis muscles.,IMPRESSION: , This electrical study is abnormal.  It reveals the following:,1.  A mild right L5 versus S1 radiculopathy.,2.  Left S1 nerve root irritation.  There is no evidence of active radiculopathy.,3.  There is no evidence of plexopathy, myopathy or peripheral neuropathy.,MRI of the lumbosacral spine wa personally reviewed and reveals bilateral L5-S1 neuroforaminal stenosis, slightly worse on the right.  Results were discussed with the patient and her daughter.  I would recommend further course of spinal epidural injection with Dr. XYZ.  If she ha no response, then surgery will need to be considered.  She agrees with this approach and will followup with you in the near future. ",2.0

Pelvic endometriosis.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: ,Total abdominal hysterectomy.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal and spinal with Astramorph.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 200 cc.,FLUIDS:  ,2400 cc of crystalloids.,URINE OUTPUT: , 100 cc of clear urine.,INDICATIONS:,  This is a 40-year-old female gravida-0 with a history of longstanding enlarged fibroid uterus.  On ultrasound, the uterus measured 14 cm x 6.5 cm x 7.8 cm.  She had received two dosage of Lupron to help shrink the fibroid.  Her most recent Pap smear wa normal.,FINDINGS: , On a manual exam, the uterus is enlarged approximately 14 to 16 week size with multiple fibroid palpated.  On laparotomy, the uterus did have multiple pedunculated fibroids, the largest being approximately 7 cm.  The bilateral tube and ovary appeared normal.,There wa evidence of endometriosis on the posterior wall of the uterus a well a the bilateral infundibulopelvic ligament.  There wa some adhesion of the bowel to the left ovary and infundibulopelvic ligament and a well a to the right infundibulopelvic ligament.,PROCEDURE:,  After consent wa obtained, the patient wa taken to the operating room where spinal anesthetic wa first administered and then general anesthetic.  The patient wa placed in the dorsal supine position and prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion.  A Pfannenstiel skin incision wa made and carried to the underlying Mayo fashion using the second knife.  The fascia wa incised in midline and the incision extended laterally using Mayo scissors.  The superior aspect of the fascial incision wa grasped with Kocher clamps, tented up, and dissected off the underlying rectus muscle both bluntly and sharply with Mayo scissors.  Attention wa then turned to the inferior aspect of the incision, which in a similar fashion wa grasped with Kocher clamps, tented up and dissected off the underlying rectus muscles.  The rectus muscle were separated in the midline and the peritoneum wa identified, grasped with hemostat, and entered sharply with Metzenbaum scissors.  This incision wa extended superiorly and inferiorly with good visualization of the bladder.  The uterus wa then brought up out of the incision.  The bowel adhesion were carefully taken down using Metzenbaum scissors.  Good hemostasis wa noted at this point.  The self-retaining retractor wa then placed.  The bladder blade wa placed.  The bowel wa gently packed with moist laparotomy sponge and held in place with the blade on the GYN extension.  The uterus wa then grasped with a Lahey clamp and brought up out of the incision.  The left round ligament wa identified and grasped with Allis clamp and tented up.  A hemostat wa passed in the avascular area beneath the round ligament.  A suture #0 Vicryl wa used to suture ligate the round ligament.  Two hemostat were placed across the round ligament proximal to the previously placed suture and the Mayo scissors were used to transect the round ligament.  An avascular area of the broad ligament wa then identified and entered bluntly.  The suture of #0 Vicryl wa then used to suture ligate the left uterovarian ligament.  Two straight Ochsner's were placed across the uterovarian ligament proximal to the previous suture.  The ligament wa then transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl.  Attention wa then turned to the right round ligament, which in a similar fashion wa tented up with an Allis clamp.  An avascular area wa entered beneath the round ligament using a hemostat and the round ligament wa suture ligated and transected.  An avascular area of the broad ligament wa then entered bluntly and the right uterovarian ligament wa then suture ligated with #0 Vicryl.,Two straight Ochsner's were placed across the ligament proximal to previous suture.  This wa then transected and suture ligated again with #0 Vicryl.  The left uterine peritoneum wa then identified and grasped with Allis clamps.  The vesicouterine peritoneum wa then transected and then entered using Metzenbaum scissors.  This incision wa extended across the anterior portion of the uterus and the bladder flap wa taken down.  It wa sharply advanced with Metzenbaum scissors and then bluntly using a moist Ray-Tec.  The Ray-Tec wa left in place at this point to ensure that the bladder wa below the level of the cervix.  The bilateral uterine artery then were skeletonized with Metzenbaum scissors and clamped bilaterally using straight Ochsner's.  Each were then transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl.  A curved Ochsner wa then placed on either side of the cervix.  The tissue wa transected using a long knife and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl.  Incidentally, prior to taking down the round ligaments, a pedunculated fibroid and the right fundal portion of the uterus wa injected with Vasopressin and removed using a Bovie.  The cervix wa then grasped with a Lahey clamp.  The cervicovaginal fascia wa then taken down first using the long-handed knife and then a back handle of the knife to bring the fascia down below the level of the cervix.  A double-pointed scissors were used to enter the vaginal vault below the level of the cervix.  A straight Ochsner wa placed on the vaginal vault.  The Jorgenson scissors were used to amputate the cervix and the uterus off of the underlying vaginal tissue.  The vaginal cuff wa then reapproximated with #0 Vicryl in a running locked fashion and the pelvis wa copiously irrigated.  There wa a small area of bleeding noted on the underside of the bladder.  The bladder wa tented up using an Allis clamp and a figure-of-eight suture of #3-0 Vicryl wa placed with excellent hemostasis noted at this point.  The uterosacral ligament were then incorporated into the vaginal cuff and the cuff wa synched down.  A figure-of-eight suture of #0 Vicryl wa placed in the midline of the vaginal cuff in attempt to incorporate the bilateral round ligament.  The round ligament wa too short.  It would be a maximal amount of stretch to incorporate, therefore, only the left round ligament wa incorporated into the vaginal cuff.  The bilateral adnexal area were then re-peritonealized with #3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The bladder flap wa reapproximated to the vaginal cuff using one interrupted suture.  The pelvis wa again irrigated at this point with excellent hemostasis noted.  Approximately 200 cc of saline with methylene blue wa placed into the Foley to inflate the bladder.  There wa no spillage of blue fluid into the abdomen.  The fluid again wa allowed to drain.  All sponge were then removed and the bowel wa allowed to return to it anatomical position.  The peritoneum wa then reapproximated with #0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The fascia wa reapproximated also with #0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The skin wa then closed with staples.,A previously placed Betadine soaked Ray-Tec wa removed from the patient's vagina and sponge stick wa used to ass any bleeding in the vaginal vault.  There wa no appreciable bleeding.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle count were correct x2.  The patient wa taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  She will be followed immediately postoperatively within the hospital. ",2.0

2847,"REASON FOR VISIT:,  The patient present for a followup for history of erythema nodosum.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , This is a 25-year-old woman who is attending psychology classes.  She wa diagnosed with presumptive erythema nodosum in 2004 based on a biopsy consistent with erythema nodosum, but not entirely specific back in Netherlands.  At that point, she had undergone workup which wa extensive for secondary disease associated with erythema nodosum.  Part of her workup included a colonoscopy.  The finding were equivocal characterizes not clearly abnormal biopsy of the terminal ileum.,The skin biopsy, in particular, mention some fibrosis, basal proliferation, and inflammatory cell in the subcutis.,Prior to the onset of her erythema nodosum, she had a tibia-fibula fracture several year before on the right, which wa not temporarily associated with the skin lesions, which are present in both leg anyway.  Even, a jaw cosmetic surgery she underwent wa long before she started developing her skin lesions.  She wa seen in our clinic and by Dermatology on several occasions.  Apart from the first couple of visit when she presented stating a recurrent skin rash with a description suggestive of erythema nodosum in the lower extremity and ankle and there is discomfort pointing towards a possible inflammatory arthritis and an initial high sed rate of above 110 with an increased CRP.  In the following visits, no evident abnormality ha been detected.  In the first visit, here some MTP discomfort detected.  It wa thought that erythema nodosum may be present.  However, the evaluation of Dermatology did not concur and it wa thought that the patient had venous stasis, which could be related to her prior fracture.  When she wa initially seen here, a suspicion of IBD, sarcoid inflammatory arthropathy, and lupus wa raised.  She had an equivocal rheumatoid fracture, but her CCP wa negative.  She had an ANA, which wa positive at 1:40 with a speckled pattern persistently, but the rest of the lupus serology including double-stranded DNA, RNP, Smith, Ro, La were negative.  Her cardiolipin panel antibody were negative a well.  We followed the IgM, IgG, and IgA being le than 10.  However, she did have a beta-2 glycoprotein 1 or an RVVT tested and this may be important since she ha a livedo pattern.  It wa thought that the onset of lupus may be the case.  It wa thought that rheumatoid arthritis could not be the case since it is not associated with erythema nodosum.  For the fear of possible lymphoma, she underwent CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  It wa done also in order to rule out sarcoid and the result wa unremarkable.  Based on some change in her bowel habit and evidence of B12 deficiency with a high methylmalonic and high homocystine level along with a low normal B12 in addition to iron study consistent with iron deficiency and an initially low MCV, the possibility of inflammatory bowel disease wa employed.  The patient underwent an initially unrevealing colonoscopy and a capsule endoscopy, which wa normal.  A second colonoscopy wa done recently and microscopically no evidence of inflammatory bowel disease wa seen.  However, eosinophil aggregation were noted in microscopy and this wa told to be consistent with an allergic reaction or an emerging Crohn disease and I will need to discus with Gastroenterology what is the significance of that.  Her possible B12 deficiency and iron deficiency were never addressed during her stay here in the United States.,In the initial appointment, she wa placed on prednisone 40 mg, which wa gradually titrated down this led to an exacerbation of her acne.  We decided to take her off prednisone due to adverse effect and start her on colchicine 0.6 mg daily.  While this kept thing under control with the inflammatory marker being positive and no overt episode of erythema nodosum, the patient still complains for sensitivity with le suspicious skin rash in the lower extremity and occasional ankle swelling and pain.  She wa reevaluated by Dermatology for that and no evidence of erythema nodosum wa felt to be present.  Out plan wa to proceed with a DEXA scan, at some point check a vitamin D level, and order vitamin D and calcium over the counter for bone protection purposes.  However, the later wa deferred until we have resolved the situation and find out what is the underlying cause of her disease.,Her past medical history apart from the tibia-fibular fracture and the jaw cosmetic surgery is significant for varicella and mononucleosis.,Her physical examination had shown consistently diffuse periarticular ankle edema and also venous stasis change at least until I took over her care last August.  I have not been able to detect any erythema nodosum, however, a livedo pattern ha been detected consistently.  She also ha evidence of acne, which doe not seem to be present at the moment.  She also wa found to have a heart murmur present and we are going to proceed with an echocardiogram placed.,Her workup during the initial appointment included an ACE level, which wa normal.  She also had a rather higher sed rate up to 30, but prior to that, per report, it wa even higher, above 110.  Her RVVT wa normal, her rheumatoid factor wa negative.  Her ANA wa 1:40, speckled pattern.  The double-stranded DNA wa negative.  Her RNP and Smith were negative a well.  RO and LA were negative and cardiolipin antibody were negative a well.  A urinalysis at the moment wa completely normal.  A CRP wa 2.3 in the initial appointment, which wa high.  A CCP wa negative.  Her CBC had shown microcytosis and hypochromia with a hematocrit of 37.7.  This improved later without any evidence of hypochromia, microcytosis or anemia with a hematocrit of 40.3.,The patient return here today, a I mentioned, complaining of milder bout of skin rash, which she call erythema nodosum, which is accompanied by arthralgias, especially in the ankles.  I am mentioning here that photosensitivity rash wa mentioned in the past.  She tell me that she had it twice back in Europe after skiing where her whole face wa swollen.  Her acne ha been very stable after she wa taken off prednisone and wa started on colchicine 0.6 daily.  Today we discussed about the effect of colchicine on a possible pregnancy.,MEDICATIONS: , Prednisone wa stopped.  Vitamin D and calcium over the counter, we need to verify that.  Colchicine 0.6 mg daily which we are going to stop, ranitidine 150 mg a needed, which she doe not take frequently.,FINDINGS:,  On physical examination, she is very pleasant, alert, and oriented x 3 and not in any acute distress.  There is some evidence of faint subcutaneous lesion in both shin bilaterally, but with mild tenderness, but no evidence of classic erythema nodosum.  Stasis dermatitis change in both lower extremity present.  Mild livedo reticularis is present a well.,There is some periarticular ankle edema a well.  Laboratory data from 04/23/07, show a normal complete metabolic profile with a creatinine of 0.7, a CBC with a white count of 7880, hematocrit of 40.3, and platelet of 228.  Her microcytosis and hypochromia ha resolved.  Her serum electrophoresis doe not show a monoclonal abnormality.  Her vitamin D level were 26, which suggests some mild insufficiency and she would probably benefit by vitamin D supplementation.  This point again towards some ileum pathology.  Her ANCA B and C were negative.  Her PF3 and MPO were unremarkable.  Her endomysial antibody were negative.  Her sed rate at this time were 19.  The highest ha been 30, but prior to her appointment here wa even higher.  Her ANA continues to be positive with a titer of 1:40, speckled pattern.  Her double-stranded DNA is negative.  Her serum immunofixation confirmed the absence of monoclonal abnormality.  Her urine immunofixation wa not performed.  Her IgG, IgA, and IgM level are normal.  Her IgE level are normal a well.  A urinalysis wa not performed this time.  Her CRP is 0.4.  Her tissue transglutaminase antibody are negative.  Her ASCA is normal and anti-OmpC wa not tested.  Gliadin antibody IgA is 12, which is in the borderline to be considered equivocal, but these are nonspecific.  I am reminding here that her homocystine level have been 15.7, slightly higher, and that her methylmalonic acid wa 385, which is obviously abnormal.  Her B12 level were 216, which is rather low possibly indicating a B12 deficiency.  Her iron study showed a ferritin of 15, a saturation of 9%, and an iron of 30.  Her TIBC wa 345 pointing towards an iron deficiency anemia.  I am reminding you that her ACE level in the past were normal and that she ha a microcytosis.  Her radiologic workup including a thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic CT did not show any suspicious adenopathy, but only small aortocaval and periaortic nodes, the largest being 8 mm in short axis, likely reactive.  Her pelvic ultrasound showed normal uterus adnexa.  Her bladder wa normal a well.  Subcentimeter inguinal node were found.  There wa no large lytic or sclerotic lesion noted.  Her recent endoscopy wa unremarkable, but the microscopy showed some eosinophil aggregation, which may be pointing towards allergy or an evolving Crohn disease.  Her capsule endoscopy wa limited secondary to rapid transit.  There wa only a tiny mucosal red spot in the proximal jejunum without active bleeding, 2 possible erosion were seen in the distal jejunum and proximal ileum.  However, no significant inflammation or bleeding wa seen and this could be small bowel crisis.  Neither evidence of bleeding or inflammation were seen a well.  Specifically, the terminal ileum appeared normal.  Recent evaluation by a dermatologist did not verify the presence of erythema nodosum.,ASSESSMENT:,  This is a 25-year-old woman diagnosed with presumptive erythema nodosum in 2004.  She ha been treated with prednisone a in the beginning she had also a wrist and ankle discomfort and high inflammatory markers.  Since I took over her care, I have not seen a clear-cut erythema nodosum being present.  No evidence of synovitis wa there.  Her serology apart from an ANA of 1:40 were negative.  She ha a livedo pattern, which ha been worrisome.  The issue here wa a possibility of inflammatory bowel disease based on deficiency in vitamin B12 a indicated by high methylmalonic and homocystine level and also iron deficiency.  She also ha low vitamin D levels, which point towards terminal ileum pathology a well and she had a history of decreased MCV.  We never received the x-ray of her hand which she had and she never had a DEXA scan.  Lymphoma ha been ruled out and we believe that inflammatory bowel disease, after repeated colonoscopy and the capsule endoscopy, ha been ruled out a well.  Sarcoid is probably not the case since the patient did not have any lymphadenopathy and her ACE level were normal.  We are going check a PPD to rule out tuberculosis.  We are going to order an RVVT and glycoprotein beta-1 level in her workup to make sure that an antiphospholipid syndrome is not present given the livedo pattern.  An anti-intrinsic factor will be added a well.  Her primary care physician need to workup the possible B12 and iron deficiency and also the vitamin D deficiency.  In the meanwhile, we feel that the patient should stop taking the colchicine and if she ha a flare of her disease then she should present to her dermatologist and have the skin biopsy performed in order to have a clear-cut answer of what is the nature of this skin rash.  Regarding her heart murmur, we are going to proceed with an echocardiogram.  A PPD should be placed a well.  In her next appointment, we may fax a requisition for vitamin B replacement.,PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES:,  1.  Recurrent erythema nodosum with ankle and wrist discomfort, ? arthritis.,2.  Iron deficiencies, according to iron studies.,3.  Borderline B12 with increased methylmalonic acid and homocystine.,4.  On chronic steroids; vitamin D and calcium is needed; she need a DEXA scan.,5.  Typical ANCA, per records, were not verified here.  ANCA and ASCA were negative and the OmpC wa not ordered.,6.  Acne.,7.  Recurrent arthralgia not present.  Rheumatoid factor, CCP negative, ANA 1:40 speckled.,8.  Livedo reticularis, beta 2-glycoprotein wa not checked, we are going to check it today.  Needs vaccination for influenza and pneumonia.,9.  Vitamin D deficiency.  She need replacement with ergocalciferol, but this may point towards ___________ pathology a this wa not detected.,10.  Recurrent ankle discomfort which necessitates ankle x-rays.,PLANS:,  We can proceed with part of her workup here in clinic, PPD, echocardiogram, ankle x-rays, and anti-intrinsic factor antibodies.  We can start repleting her vitamin D with __________ week of ergocalciferol 50,000 weekly.  We can add an RVVT and glycoprotein to her workup in order to rule out any antiphospholipid syndrome.  She should be taking vitamin D and calcium after the completion of vitamin D replacement.  She should be seen by her primary care physician, have the iron and B12 deficiency worked up.  She should stop the colchicine and if the skin lesion recurs then she should be seen by her dermatologist.  Based on the physical examination, we do not suspect that the patient ha the presence of any other disease associated with erythema nodosum.  We are going to add an amylase and lipase to evaluate her pancreatic function, RPR, HIV, __________ serologies.  Given the evidence of possible malabsorption it may be significant to proceed with an upper endoscopy to rule out Whipple disease or celiac disease which can sometimes be associated with erythema nodosum.  An anti-intrinsic factor would be added, a I mentioned.  I doubt whether the patient ha Behcet disease given the absence of oral or genital ulcers.  She doe not give a history of oral contraceptive or medication that could be related to erythema nodosum.  She doe not have any evidence of lupus __________ mycosis.  Histoplasmosis coccidioidomycosis would be accompanied by other symptoms.  Hodgkin disease ha probably been ruled out with a CAT scan.  However, we are going to add an LDH in future workup.  I need to discus with her primary care physician regarding the need for workup of her vitamin B12 deficiency and also with her gastroenterologist regarding the need for an upper endoscopy.  The patient will return in 1 month. ",2.0
4631,"DIAGNOSIS: , Aortic valve stenosis with coronary artery disease associated with congestive heart failure.  The patient ha diabetes and is morbidly obese.,PROCEDURES: , Aortic valve replacement using a mechanical valve and two-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting procedure using saphenous vein graft to the first obtuse marginal artery and left radial artery graft to the left anterior descending artery.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal,INCISION: , Median sternotomy,INDICATIONS: , The patient presented with severe congestive heart failure associated with the patient's severe diabetes.  The patient wa found to have moderately stenotic aortic valve.  In addition, The patient had significant coronary artery disease consisting of a chronically occluded right coronary artery but a very important large obtuse marginal artery coming off a the main circumflex system.  The patient also ha a left anterior descending artery which ha moderate disease and this supply quite a bit of collateral to the patient's right system.  It wa decided to perform a valve replacement a well a coronary artery bypass grafting procedure.,FINDINGS: , The left ventricle is certainly hypertrophied¬∑ The aortic valve leaflet is calcified and a severe restrictive leaflet motion.  It is a tricuspid type of valve.  The coronary artery consists of a large left anterior descending artery which is associated with 60% stenosis but a large obtuse marginal artery which ha a tight proximal stenosis.,The radial artery wa used for the left anterior descending artery.  Flow wa excellent.  Looking at the target in the posterior descending artery territory, there did not appear to be any large branches.  On the angiogram these vessel appeared to be quite small.  Because this is a chronically occluded vessel and the patient ha limited conduit due to the patient's massive obesity, attempt to bypass to this area wa not undertaken.  The patient wa brought to the operating room,PROCEDURE: , The patient wa brought to the operating room and placed in supine position.  A median sternotomy incision wa carried out and conduit were taken from the left arm a well a the right thigh.  The patient weighs nearly three hundred pounds.  There wa concern a to taking down the left internal mammary artery.  Because the radial artery appeared to be a good conduit The patient would have arterial graft to the left anterior descending artery territory.  The patient wa cannulated after the aorta and atrium were exposed and full heparinization.,The patient went on cardiopulmonary bypass and the aortic cross-clamp wa applied Cardioplegia wa delivered through the coronary sinus in a retrograde manner.  The patient wa cooled to 32 degrees.  Iced slush wa applied to the heart.  The aortic valve wa then exposed through the aortic root by transverse incision.  The valve leaflet were removed and the #23 St. Jude mechanical valve wa secured into position by circumferential pledgeted sutures.  At this point, aortotomy wa closed.,The first obtuse marginal artery wa a very large target and the vein graft to this target indeed produced an excellent amount of flow.  Proximal anastomosis wa then carried out to the foot of the aorta.  The left anterior descending artery doe not have severe disease but is also a very good target and the radial artery wa anastomosed to this target in an end-to-side manner.  The two proximal anastomosis were then carried out to the root of the aorta.,The patient came off cardiopulmonary bypass after aortic cross-clamp wa released.  The patient wa adequately warmed.  Protamine wa given without adverse effect.  Sternal closure wa then done using wires.  The subcutaneous layer were closed using Vicryl suture.  The skin wa approximated using staples. ",1.0

3293,"NAME OF PROCEDURES,1.  Selective coronary angiography.,2.  Left heart catheterization.,3.  Left ventriculography.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The right groin wa sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  The area of the right coronary artery wa anesthetized with 2% lidocaine and a 4-French sheath wa placed.  Conscious sedation wa obtained using a combination of Versed 1 mg and fentanyl 50 mcg.  A left #4, 4-French, Judkins catheter wa placed and advanced through the ostium of the left main coronary artery.  Because of difficulty positioning the catheter, the catheter wa removed and a 6-French sheath wa placed and a 6-French #4 left Judkins catheter wa placed.  This wa advanced through the ostium of the left main coronary artery where selective angiogram were performed.  Following this, the 4-French right Judkins catheter wa placed and angiogram of the right coronary were performed.  A pigtail catheter wa placed and a left heart catheterization wa performed, followed by a left ventriculogram.  The left heart pullback wa performed.  The catheter wa removed and a small injection of contrast wa given to the sheath.  The sheath wa removed over a wire and an Angio-Seal wa placed.  There were no complications.  Total contrast medium wa 200 mL of Optiray 350.  Fluoroscopy time 5.3 minutes.  Total x-ray dose is 1783 mGy.,HEMODYNAMICS:  ,Rhythm is sinus throughout the procedure.  LV pressure of 155/22 mmHg, aortic pressure of 160/80 mmHg.  LV pullback demonstrates no gradient.,The right coronary artery is a nondominant vessel and free of disease.  This also give rise to the conus branch and two RV free wall branches.  The left main ha minor plaquing in the inferior aspect measuring no more than 10% to 15%.  This vessel then bifurcates into the LAD and circumflex.  The circumflex is a large caliber vessel and is dominant.  This vessel give rise to a large first marginal artery, a moderate sized second marginal branch, and additionally give rise to a large third marginal artery and the PDA.  There wa a very eccentric and severe stenosis in the proximal circumflex measuring approximately 90% in severity.  The origin of the first marginal artery ha a severe stenosis measuring approximately 90% in severity.  The distal circumflex ha a 60% lesion just prior to the origin of the third marginal branch and PDA.,The proximal LAD is ectatic.  The LAD give rise to a large first diagonal artery that ha a 90% lesion in it origin and a subtotal occlusion midway down the diagonal.  Distal to the origin of this diagonal branch, there is another area of ectasia in the LAD, followed by an area of stenosis that in some view is approximately 50% in severity.,The left ventriculogram demonstrates hypokinesis of the distal half of the inferior wall.

She ha been unresponsive to conservative measures.  All risks, complications, anticipated benefits, and postoperative course were discussed.  The patient ha agreed to proceed with surgery a described below.,GROSS FINDINGS: , There wa noted to be eburnation and wear along the patellofemoral joint and femoral tibial articulation medially and laterally with osteophyte formation and sclerosis.,SPECIFICATIONS: , The Zimmer NexGen total knee system wa utilized.,PROCEDURE: , The patient wa taken to the operating room #2 and placed in supine position on the operating room table.  She wa administered spinal anesthetic by Dr. Z.,The tourniquet wa placed about the proximal aspect of the right lower extremity.  The right lower extremity wa then sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  An Esmarch bandage wa used to exsanguinate the right lower extremity and the tourniquet wa inflated to 325 mmHg.  Longitudinal incision wa made over the anterior aspect of the right knee.  Subcutaneous tissue wa carefully dissected.  A medial parapatellar retinacular incision wa made.  The patella wa then everted and the above noted gross finding were appreciated.  A drill hole wa placed in the distal aspect of the femur and the distal femoral cutting guide were positioned in place.  The appropriate cut were made at the distal femur a well a with use of the chamfer guide.  The trial femoral component wa then positioned in place and noted to have good fit.  Attention wa then directed to proximal tibia, the external tibial alignment guide wa positioned in place and the proximal tibial cut wa made demonstrating satisfactory cut.  The medial and lateral collateral ligament remained intact throughout the procedure a well a the posterior cruciate ligaments.  The remnant of the anterior cruciate ligament and meniscus were resected.  The tibial trial wa positioned in place.  Intraoperative radiograph were taken, demonstrating satisfactory alignment of the tibial cut.  The tibial hole were then drilled.  The patella wa then addressed with the Bovie used to remove the soft tissue around the perimeter of the patella.  The patellar cutting guide wa positioned in place and the posterior aspect of the patella wa resected to the appropriate thickness.  Three drill hole were made within the patella after it wa determined that 35 mm patella would be most appropriate.  The knee wa placed through range of motion with the trial component marked and then the appropriate component obtained.  The tibial tray wa inserted with cement, backed it into place, excess methylmethacrylate wa removed.  The femoral component wa inserted with methylmethacrylate.  Any excessive methylmethacrylate and bony debris were removed from the joint.  Trial Poly wa positioned in place and the knee wa held in full extension while the methylmethacrylate became firm.  The methylmethacrylate wa also used at the patella.  The prosthesis wa positioned in place.  The patellar clamp held securely till the methylmethacrylate wa firm.  After all three component were in place, the knee wa then again in placed range of motion and there appeared to be some torsion to the proximal tibial component and concerned regarding the alignment.  This component wa removed and revised to a stemmed component with better alignment and position.  The previous component removed, the methylmethacrylate wa removed.  Further irrigation wa performed and then a stemmed template wa positioned in place with the intramedullary alignment guide positioned and the tibia drilled and broached.  The trial tibial stemmed component wa positioned in place.  Knee wa placed through range of motion and the tracking wa better.  Actual component wa then obtained, methyl methacrylate wa placed within the tibia.  The stemmed tibial component wa impacted into place with good fit.  The Poly wa then positioned in place.  Knee held in full extension with compression longitudinally after methylmethacrylate wa solidified.  The trial Poly wa removed.  Wound wa irrigated and the joint wa inspected.  There wa no debris.  Collateral ligament and posterior cruciate ligament remained intact.  Soft tissue balancing wa done and a 17 mm Poly wa then inserted with the knee and tibial and femoral component with good tracking a well a the patellar component.  The tourniquet wa deflated.  Hemostasis wa satisfactory.  A drain wa placed into the depth of the wound.  The medial retinacular incision wa closed with one Ethibond suture in interrupted fashion.  The knee wa placed through range of motion and there wa no undue tissue tension, good patellar tracking, no excessive soft tissue laxity or constrain.  The subcutaneous tissue wa closed with #2-0 undyed Vicryl in interrupted fashion.  The skin wa closed with surgical clips.  The exterior of the wound wa cleansed a well padded dressing ABDs and ace wrap over the right lower extremity.  At the completion of the procedure, distal pulse were intact.  Toes were pink, warm, with good capillary refill.  Distal neurovascular status wa intact.  Postoperative x-ray demonstrated satisfactory alignment of the prosthesis.  Prognosis is good in this 79-year-old female with a significant degenerative arthritis. ",2.0

He wa anesthetized with a combination of 2% lidocaine and 0.5% Marcaine with Epinephrine on both upper eyelids.  The area of obvious scar tissue from the radiation for the squamous cell carcinoma on the right upper eyelid wa completely excised down to the eyelid margin including resection of a few of the upper eye lashes.  This wa extended essentially from the punctum to the lateral commissure and extended up on to the upper eyelid.  The resection wa carried down through the orbicularis muscle resecting the pretarsal orbicularis muscle and the inferior portion of the preseptal orbicularis muscle leaving the tarsus intact and leaving the orbital septum intact.  Following complete resection, the patient wa easily able to open and close his eye a the levator muscle insertion wa left intact to the tarsal plate.  The specimen wa sent to pathology, which revealed only fibrotic tissue and no evidence of any residual squamous cell carcinoma.  Meticulous hemostasis wa obtained with Bovie cautery and a full-thickness skin graft wa taken from the opposite upper eyelid in a fashion similar to a blepharoplasty of the appropriate size for the defect in the right upper eyelid.  The left upper eyelid incision wa closed with 6-0 fast-absorbing gut interrupted sutures, and the skin graft wa sutured in place with 6-0 fast-absorbing gut interrupted sutures.  An eye patch wa placed on the right side, and the patient tolerated the procedure well and wa taken to PACU in good condition. ",2.0

A total of 10 mL mixture with a 70/30 mixture of 2% Xylocaine without epinephrine and 0.75% bupivacaine without epinephrine.  An adequate amount of anesthetic wa infused around the eye without giving excessive tension to the eye or excessive chemosis to the periorbital area.  Manual pressure and a Honan balloon were placed over the eye for approximately 2 minute after injection and adequate akinesia and anesthesia wa noted.  Vital sign monitor were detached from the patient.  The patient wa moved to the operative suite and the same monitor were reattached.  The periocular area wa cleansed, dried, prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner for ocular surgery.  The speculum wa set into place and the operative microscope wa brought over the eye.  The eye wa examined.  Adequate mydriasis wa observed and a visually significant cataract wa noted on the visual axis.,A temporal clear corneal incision wa begun using a crescent blade with an initial groove incision made partial thickness through the temporal clear cornea.  Then a pocket incision wa created without entering the anterior chamber of the eye.  Two peripheral paracentesis port were created on each side of the initial incision site.

She wa admitted due to a seizure and myoclonic jerk a well a hypoglycemia and anemia.  Regarding the seizure disorder, Neurology wa consulted.  Noncontrast CT of the head wa negative.  Neurology felt that the only necessary intervention at that time would be to increase her Lamictal to 150 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the evening with gradual increase of the dosage until she wa on 200 mg b.i.d.  Regarding the hypoglycemia, the patient ha diabetic gastroparesis and wa being fed on J-tube intermittent feeding throughout the night at the rate of 120 an hour.  Her insulin pump had a basal rate of roughly three at night during the feedings.  While in the hospital, the insulin pump rate wa turned down to 1.5 and then subsequently decreased a few other times.  She seemed to tolerate the insulin pump rate well throughout her hospital course.  There were a few episode of hypoglycemia a well a hyperglycemia, but the episode seem to be related to the patient's n.p.o. status and the changing rate of tube feeding throughout her hospital course.,At discharge, her endocrinologist wa contacted.  It wa decided to change her insulin pump rate to 3 unit per hour from midnight till 6 a.m., from 0.8 unit per hour from 6 a.m. until 8 a.m., and then at 0.2 unit per hour from 8 a.m. until 6 p.m.  The insulin wa to be NovoLog.  Regarding the anemia, the gastroenterologist were consulted regarding her positive Hemoccult stools.  A colonoscopy wa performed, which found a mass at the right hepatic flexure.  General Surgery wa then consulted and a right hemicolectomy wa performed on the patient.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and tube feed were slowly restarted following the procedure, and prior to discharge were back at her predischarge rate of 120 per hour.  Regarding the cancer itself, it wa found that 1 out of 53 node were positive for cancer.  CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed no metastasis, a CT of the chest revealed possible lung metastasis.  Later in hospital course, the patient developed a septic-like picture likely secondary to hospital-acquired pneumonia.  She wa treated with Zosyn, Levaquin, and vancomycin, and tolerated the medication well.  Her symptom decreased and serial chest x-ray were followed, which showed some resolution of the illness.  The patient wa seen by the Infectious Disease specialist.  The Infectious Disease specialist recommended vancomycin to cover MRSA bacteria, which wa found at the J-tube site.  At discharge, the patient wa given three additional day of p.o. Levaquin 750 mg a well a three additional day of Bactrim DS every 12 hours.  The Bactrim wa used to cover the MRSA at the J-tube site.  It wa found that MRSA wa sensitive to Bactrim.  Throughout her hospital course, the patient continued to receive Coreg 12.5 mg daily and Lasix 40 mg twice a day for her congestive heart failure, which remains stable.

The patient wa positioned in the modified beachchair position utilizing the Mayfield headrest.  The left shoulder wa propped posteriorly with a rolled towel.  His head wa secured to the Mayfield headrest.  The left shoulder and upper extremity were then prepped and draped in the usual manner.  A posterior lateral port wa made for _____ the arthroscopic cannula.  The scope wa introduced into the glenohumeral joint.  There wa noted to be a complete tear of the anterior glenoid labrum off from superiorly at about 11:30 extending down inferiorly to about 6 o'clock.  The labrum wa adherent to the underlying capsule.  The margin of the glenoid wa frayed in this area.  The biceps tendon wa noted to be intact.  The articular surface of the glenoid wa fairly well preserved.  The articular surface on the humeral head wa intact; however, there wa a large Hill-Sachs lesion on the posterolateral aspect of the humeral head.  The rotator cuff wa visualized and noted to be intact.  The axillary pouch wa visualized and it wa free of injury.  There were some cartilaginous fragment within the axillary pouch.  Attention wa first directed after making an anterior portal to fixation of the anterior glenoid labrum.  Utilizing the Chirotech system through the anterior cannula, the labrum wa secured with the pin and drill component and wa then tacked back to the superior glenoid rim at about the 11 o'clock position.  A second tack wa then placed at about the 8 o'clock position.  The labrum wa then probed and wa noted to be stable.  With some general ranging of the shoulder, the tissue wa pulled out from the tacks.  An attempt wa made at placement of two other tacks; however, the tissue wa not of good quality to be held in position.  Therefore, all tack were either buried down to a flat surface or were removed from the anterior glenoid area.  At this point, it wa deemed that an open Bankart arthroplasty wa necessary.  The arthroscopic instrument were removed.  An anterior incision wa made extending from just lateral of the coracoid down toward the axillary fold.  The skin incision wa taken down through the skin.  Subcutaneous tissue were then separated with the coag Bovie to provide hemostasis.  The deltopectoral fascia wa identified.  It wa split at the deltopectoral interval and the deltoid wa reflected laterally.  The subdeltoid bursa wa then removed with rongeurs.  The conjoint tendon wa identified.  The deltoid and conjoint tendon were then retracted with a self-retaining retractor.  The subscapularis tendon wa identified.  It wa separated about a centimeter from it insertion, leaving the tissue to do sew later.  The subscapularis wa reflected off superiorly and inferiorly and the muscle retracted medially.  This allowed for visualization of the capsule.  The capsule wa split near the humeral head insertion leaving a tag for repair.  It wa then split longitudinally towards the glenoid at approximately 9 o'clock position.  This provided visualization of the glenohumeral joint.  The friable labral and capsular tissue wa identified.  The glenoid neck wa already prepared for suturing, therefore, three Mitek suture anchor were then positioned to place at approximately 7 o'clock, 9 o'clock, and 10 o'clock.  The suture were passed through the labral capsular tissue and tied securely.  At this point, the anterior glenoid rim had been recreated.  The joint wa then copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution and suctioned dry.  The capsule wa then repaired with interrupted #1 Vicryl suture and repaired back to it insertion site with #1 Vicryl suture.  This later wa then copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution and suctioned dry.  Subscapularis wa reapproximated on to the lesser tuberosity of the humerus utilizing interrupted #1 Vicryl suture.  This later wa then copiously irrigated a well and suctioned dry.  The deltoid fascia wa approximated with running #2-0 Vicryl suture.  Subcutaneous tissue were approximated with interrupted #2-0 Vicryl and the skin wa approximated with a running #4-0 subcuticular Vicryl followed by placement of Steri-Strips.  0.25% Marcaine wa placed in the subcutaneous area for postoperative analgesia.  The patient wa then placed in a shoulder immobilizer after a bulky dressing had been applied.  The patient wa then transferred to the recovery room in apparent satisfactory condition. ",2.0

3201,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Empyema of the chest, left.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Empyema of the chest, left.,PROCEDURE: , Left thoracotomy with total pulmonary decortication and parietal pleurectomy.,PROCEDURE DETAIL: , After obtaining the informed consent, the patient wa brought to the operating room, where he underwent a general endotracheal anesthetic using a double-lumen endotracheal tube.  A time-out process had been followed and preoperative antibiotic were given.,The patient wa positioned with the left side up for a left thoracotomy.  The patient wa prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  A posterolateral thoracotomy wa performed.  It included the previous incision.  The chest wa entered through the fifth intercostal space.  Actually, there wa a very strong and hard parietal pleura, which initially did not allow u to obtain a good exposure, and actually the layer wa so tough that the pin of the chest retractor broke.  Thanks to Dr. X's ingenuity, we were able to reuse the chest retractor and opened the chest after I incised the thickened parietal pleura resulting in an explosion of gas and pu from a cavity that wa obviously welled off by the parietal pleura.  We aspirated an abundant amount of pu from this cavity.  The sample wa taken for culture and sensitivity.,Then, at least half an hour wa spent trying to excise the parietal pleura and finally we were able to accomplish that up to the apex and back to the aorta __________ towards the heart including his diaphragm.  Once we accomplished that, we proceeded to remove the solid exudate that wa adhered to the lung.  Further sample for culture and sensitivity were sent.,Then, we were left with the trapped lung.  It wa trapped by thickened visceral pleura.  This wa the most difficult part of the operation and it wa very difficult to remove the parietal pleura without injuring the lung extensively.  Finally, we were able to achieve this and after the corresponding lumen of the endotracheal tube wa opened, we were able to inflate both the left upper and lower lobe of the lung satisfactorily.  There wa only one area towards the mediastinum that apparently I wa not able to fill.  This area, of course, wa very rigid but any surgery in the direction __________ would have caused __________ injury, so I restrained from doing that.  Two large chest tube were placed.  The cavity had been abundantly irrigated with warm saline.  Then, the thoracotomy wa closed in layer using heavy stitch of Vicryl a pericostal suture and then several figure-of-eight interrupted suture to the muscle layer and a combination of nylon stitch and staple to the skin.,The chest tube were affixed to the skin with heavy suture of silk.  Dressings were applied and the patient wa put back in the supine position and after a few minute of observation and evaluation, he wa able to be extubated in the operating room.,Estimated blood loss wa about 500 mL.  The patient tolerated the procedure very well and wa sent to the ICU in a satisfactory condition. ",2.0
4444,"SUBJECTIVE: , This patient present to the office today because of some problem with her right hand.  It ha been going tingling and getting numb periodically over several weeks.  She just recently moved her keyboard down at work.  She is hoping that will help.  She is worried about carpal tunnel.  She doe a lot of repetitive type activities.  It is worse at night.  If she sleep on it a certain way, she will wake up and it will be tingling then she can usually shake out the tingling, but nonetheless it is very bothersome for her.  It involves mostly the middle finger, although, she say it also involves the first and second digit on the right hand.  She ha some pain in her thumb a well.  She think that could be arthritis.,OBJECTIVE: , Weight 213.2 pounds, blood pressure 142/84, pulse 92, respiration 16.  General:  The patient is nontoxic and in no acute distress.  Musculoskeletal:  The right hand wa examined.  It appears to be within normal limit and the appearance is similar to the left hand.  She ha good and equal grip strength noted bilaterally.  She ha negative Tinel's bilaterally.  She ha a positive Phalen's test.  The finger on the right hand are neurovascularly intact with a normal capillary refill.,ASSESSMENT:  ,Numbness and tingling in the right upper extremity, intermittent and related to the positioning of the wrist.  I suspect carpal tunnel syndrome.,PLAN:  ,The patient is going to use Anaprox double strength one pill every 12 hour with food a well a a cock-up wrist splint.  We are going to try this for two week and if the condition is still present, then we are going to proceed with EMG test at that time.  She is going to let me know.  While she is here, I am going to also get her the blood test she need for her diabetes.  I am noting that her blood pressure is elevated, but improved from the last visit.  I also noticed that she ha lost a lot of weight.  She is working on diet and exercise and she is doing a great job.  Right now for the blood pressure we are going to continue to observe a she carry forward additional measure in her diet and exercise to lose more weight and I expect the blood pressure will continue to improve.

He also had some comminution of the medial femoral condyle which prohibited an anatomic key between the two segment of the medial condyle.,IMPLANTS:, We used 2.4 and 3.5 cortical screws, a well a a LISS Synthes femoral locking plate.,COMPLICATIONS:, None.,IV FLUIDS:, 2000,ANESTHESIA:, General endotracheal.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:, 40 mL,URINE OUTPUT:, 650,HISTORY: ,This 45-year-old male had a ground-level fall, sustaining this injury. He wa admitted for definitive operative fixation. Risks and benefit were discussed, he agreed to go ahead with the procedure.,DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION:, The patient wa identified in preop holding, then taken to the operating room. Once adequate anesthesia wa obtained, his left lower extremity wa prepped and draped in a routine sterile fashion. He wa given antibiotics. He placed a traction pin through his proximal tibia, and pulled weight off the end of the bed. I made a midline approach and then did the lateral parapatellar arthrotomy. We excised some of the fat pad to give u better visibility into the notch. We excised a good bit of his synovium and synovial pouch. At this time we were able to identify the fracture fragments. Again, there wa an intercondylar split and then two free piece of the medial condyle. The femur fracture wa very distal through the metaphysis. At this time we thoroughly cleaned out all the clot between all the fracture fragment and cleaned the cortical margins.,Next we began the reduction. There wa no reduction key between the two segment of the Hoffa fracture. Therefore, we reduced the anterior portion of the medial condyle to the lateral condyle, held it with point-of-reduction clamp and K-wires, and then secured it with 2.4 mini fragment lag screws. Next, with this medial anterior piece in place, we had some contour over the notch with which we were able to reduce the posterior medial Hoffa fragment. This gave u a nice notch contour. Again, there wa some comminution laterally so that the fracture between the Hoffa segment did not have a perfect key. Once we had it reduced, based on the notch reduction, we then held it with K-wires. We secured it with two 3.5 cortical screw from the lateral condyle into this posterior segment. We then secured it with 2.4 cortical screw from the anterior medial to the posterior medial segment just subchondral. Then, finally, we secured it with a 3.5 cortical screw from the anterior medial to the posterior medial piece. All screw ran between and out of the notch.,With the condyle now well reduced, we reduced it to the metaphysis. We slid a 13-hole LISS plate submuscularly. We checked on AP and lateral view that showed we had good reduction of the fracture and appropriate plate placement. We placed the tip threaded guidewire through the A-hole of the plate jig and got it parallel to the joint. We then clamped the plate down to the bone. Proximally, we made a stab incision for the trocar at the 13-hole position, placed our tip threaded guidewire in the lateral aspect of the femur, checked it on lateral view, and had it in good position.,With the jig in appropriate position and clamped, we then proceeded to fill the distal locking screw to get purchase into the condyles. We then placed multiple unicortical locking screw in the shaft and metaphyseal segment. Our most proximal screw wa proximal to the tip of the prosthesis.,At this time we took the jig off and put the final screw into the A-hole of the plate. We then took final C-arm view which showed we had a good reduction on AP and lateral views, the plate wa in good position, we had full range of motion of the knee, and good reduction clinically and radiographically. We then pulse lavaged the knee with 3 liter of fluid. We closed the quad tendon and lateral retinaculum with interrupted 0 Vicryl over a Hemovac drain. Subdermal tissue wa closed with 2-0 Vicryl, skin with staples. Sterile dressing and a hinged knee brace were applied. The patient wa awakened from anesthesia and taken to Recovery in stable condition.,PLAN:,1. Nonweightbearing for 3 months.,2. CPM for 0 to 90 degree a tolerated. ",1.0

An incision wa made in the right groin and the greater saphenous vein at it junction with the femoral vein wa dissected out and all branch were ligated and divided.  Then, an incision wa made just below the knee where the greater saphenous vein wa also found and connection to varix from the calf were seen.  A third incision wa made in the distal third of the right thigh in the area where there wa a communication with large branch varicosities.  Then, a vein stripper wa passed from the right calf up to the groin and the greater saphenous vein, which wa divided, wa stripped without any difficultly.  Several minute of compression wa used for hemostasis.  Then, the exposed branch varicosity both in the lower third of the thigh and in the calf were dissected out and then many stab were performed to do stab phlebectomy at the level of the thigh and the level of the calf a much a the position would allow u to do.,Then in the left thigh, a groin incision wa made and the greater saphenous vein wa dissected out in the same way a wa on the other side.  Also, an incision wa made in the level of the knee and the saphenous vein wa isolated there.  The saphenous vein wa stripped and a several minute of local compression wa performed for hemostasis.  Then, a number of stab to perform phlebectomy were performed at the level of the calf to excise branch varicosity to the extent that the patient's position would allow us.  Then, all incision were closed in layer with Vicryl and staples.,Then, the patient wa placed in the prone position and the stab phlebectomy of the right thigh and calf and left thigh and calf were performed using 10 to 20 stab in each leg.  The stab phlebectomy were performed with a hook and they were very satisfactory.  Hemostasis achieved with compression and then staple were applied to the skin.,Then, the patient wa rolled onto a stretcher where both leg were wrapped with the Kerlix, fluffs, and Ace bandages.,Estimated blood loss probably wa about 150 mL.

Subsequently, she developed a wound infection, which ha since healed.  On our most recent visit to our clinic, she ha her perineal stitch removed and present today for followup of her perineal wound.  She describes no drainage or erythema from her bottom.  She is having good ostomy output.  She doe not describe any fevers, chills, nausea, or vomiting.  The patient doe describe some intermittent pain beneath the upper portion of the incision a well a in the right lower quadrant below her ostomy.  She ha been taking Percocet for this pain and it doe work.  She ha since run out ha been trying extra strength Tylenol, which will occasionally help this intermittent pain.  She is requesting additional pain medication for this occasional abdominal pain, which she still experiences.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , Temperature 95.8, pulse 68, blood pressure 132/73, and weight 159 pounds.  This is a pleasant female in no acute distress.  The patient's abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with a well-healed midline scar.  There is an ileostomy in the right hemiabdomen, which is pink, patent, productive, and protuberant.  There are no sign of mass or hernia over the patient's abdomen.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , This is a pleasant 50-year-old female who ha undergone an APR secondary to refractory ulcerative colitis.  Overall, her quality of life ha significantly improved since she had her APR.  She is functioning well with her ileostomy.  She did have concern or question about her diet and we discussed the BRAT diet, which consisted of food that would slow down the digestive tract such a bananas, rice, toast, cheese, and peanut butter.  I discussed the need to monitor her ileostomy output and preferential amount of daily output is 2 liter or less.  I have counseled her on refraining from soft drink and fruit drinks.  I have also discussed with her that this diet is moreover a trial and error and that she may try certain food that did not agree with her ileostomy, however others may and that this is something she will just have to perform trial with over the next several month until she find what food that she can and cannot eat with her ileostomy.  She also had question about her occasional abdominal pain.  I told her that this wa probably continue to improve a month went by and I gave her a refill of her Percocet for the continued occasional pain.  I told her that this would the last time I would refill the Percocet and if she ha continued pain after she finish this bottle then she would need to start ibuprofen or Tylenol if she had continued pain.  The patient then brought up some right hand and arm numbness, which ha been there postsurgically and wa thought to be from positioning during surgery.  This is all primarily gone away except for a little bit of numbness at the tip of the third digit a well a some occasional forearm muscle cramping.  I told her that I felt that this would continue to improve a it ha done over the past two month since her surgery.  I told her to continue doing hand exercise a she ha been doing and this seems to be working for her.  Overall, I think she ha healed from her surgery and is doing very well.  Again, her quality of life is significantly improved.  She is happy with her performance.  We will see her back in six month just for a general routine checkup and see how she is doing at that time.

He also started having some abdominal pain; however, he continued about his regular activity until the other day when he passed out at home.  His wife called paramedic and he wa brought to the emergency room.,The patient ha had a workup at this time which show bilateral pulmonary infarcts.  He ha been started on heparin and we are asked to see him because of increasing BUN and creatinine.,The patient ha no past history of any renal problems.  He feel that he ha been in good health until this current episode.  His appetite ha been good.  He denies swelling in his foot or ankles.  He denies chest pain.

Deep venous thromboses with pulmonary embolism.,DISCUSSION: , We are presented with a 36-year-old gentleman who ha been in good health until this current event.  He most likely ha a hypercoagulable state and ha bilateral pulmonary emboli.  Most likely, the patient ha also had embolus to his renal vein and it is causing renal vein thrombosis.,Interestingly, the urine protein wa obtained which is not that elevated and I would suspect that it would have been higher.  Unfortunately, the patient ha been exposed to IV dye and my anxiety is that this too is contributing to his current problem.,The patient's urine output is about 30 to 40 mL per hour.,Several chemistry have been ordered.  A triple renal scan ha been ordered.,I reviewed all of this with the patient and his wife.  Hopefully under his current anticoagulation, there will be some resolution of his renal vein thrombosis.

He ha had prolonged hospitalization because of this problem.  He wa recently discharged when he wa noted to develop a an outpatient swollen, red tender leg.  Examination in the emergency room revealed significant concern for significant cellulitis.  Decision wa made to admit him to the hospital.,HOSPITAL COURSE:,  The patient wa admitted on 03/26/08 and wa started on IV antibiotic elevation, wa also counseled to minimizing the cigarette smoking.  The patient had edema of his bilateral lower extremities.  The hospital consult wa also obtained to address edema issue question wa related to his liver hepatitis C.  Hospital consult wa obtained.  This included an ultrasound of his abdomen, which showed just mild cirrhosis.

1665,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:, The patient is a 43-year-old male who wa recently discharged from our care on the 1/13/06 when he presented for shortness of breath. He ha a past history of known hyperthyroidism since 1992 and a more recent history of atrial fibrillation and congestive cardiac failure with an ejection fraction of 20%-25%. The main cause for his shortness of breath wa believed to be due to atrial fibrillation secondary to hyperthyroidism in a setting with congestive cardiac failure. During his hospital stay, he wa commenced on metoprolol for rate control, and given that he had atrial fibrillation, he wa also started on warfarin, which his INR ha been followed up by the Homeless Clinic. For his congestive cardiac failure, he wa restarted on Digoxin and lisinopril. For his hyperthyroidism, we restarted him on PTU and the endocrinologist were happy to review him when he wa euthymic to discus further radioiodine or radiotherapy. He wa restarted on PTU and discharged from the hospital on this medication. While in the hospital, it wa also noted that he abused cigarette and cocaine, and we advised strongly against this given the condition of his heart. It wa also noted that he had elevated liver function tests, which an ultrasound wa normal, but his hepatitis panel wa pending. Since his discharge, his hepatitis panel ha come back normal for hepatitis A, B, and C. Since discharge, the patient ha complained of shortness of breath, mainly at night when lying flat, but otherwise he state he ha been well and compliant with his medication.,MEDICATIONS:, Digoxin 250 mcg daily, lisinopril 5 mg daily, metoprolol 50 mg twice daily, PTU (propylthiouracil) 300 mg orally four time a day, warfarin variable dose based on INR.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS: He wa afebrile today. Blood pressure 114/98. Pulse 92 but irregular. Respiratory rate 25.,HEENT: Obvious exophthalmus, but no obvious lid lag today.,NECK: There wa no thyroid mass palpable.,CHEST: Clear except for occasional bibasilar crackles.,CARDIOVASCULAR: Heart sound were dual, but irregular, with no additional sounds.,ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, nondistended.,EXTREMITIES: Mild +1 peripheral edema in both legs.,PLAN:, The patient ha also been attending the Homeless Clinic since discharge from the hospital, where he ha been receiving quality care and they have been looking after every aspect of his health, including his hyperthyroidism. It is our recommendation that a TSH and T4 be continually checked until the patient is euthymic, at which time he should attend endocrine review with Dr. Huffman for further treatment of his hyperthyroidism. Regarding his atrial fibrillation, he is moderately rate controlled with metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d. His rate in clinic today wa 92. He could benefit from increasing his metoprolol dose, however, in the hospital it wa noted that he wa bradycardic in the morning with a pulse rate down to the 50s, and we were concerned with making this patient bradycardic in the setting of congestive cardiac failure. Regarding his congestive cardiac failure, he currently appears stable, with some variation in his weight. He state he ha been taking his wife's Lasix tablet for diuretic benefit when he feel weight gain coming on and increased edema. We should consider adding him on a low-dose furosemide tablet to be taken either daily or when his weight is above his target range. A Digoxin level ha not been repeated since discharge, and we feel that this should be followed up. We have also increased his lisinopril to 5 mg daily, but the patient did not receive his script upon departing our clinic. Regarding his elevated liver function tests, we feel that these are very likely secondary to hepatic congestion secondary to congestive cardiac failure with a normal ultrasound and normal hepatitis panel, but yet the liver function test should be followed up.

The patient presented with what appeared to be a COPD exacerbation and had mildly positive cardiac enzyme marker suggestive of a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. He wa subsequently dispositioned to the cardiac catheterization lab for further evaluation.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:, After informed consent wa obtained, the patient wa taken to the cardiac catheterization lab, where his procedure wa performed. The patient wa appropriately prepped and prepared on the table, after which his right groin wa locally anesthetized with 1% lidocaine. Then, a 6-French sheath wa inserted into the right femoral artery. Over a standard 0.035 guidewire, coronary angiography and left ventricular pressure measurement were performed using a 6-French JL4 diagnostic catheter to image the left coronary artery, a 6-French JR4 diagnostic catheter to image the right coronary artery, a 6-French angled pigtail catheter to measure left ventricular pressure. At the conclusion of the diagnostic study, the case wa progressed to percutaneous coronary intervention, which will be described below. Subsequently, right femoral artery angiography wa performed which showed right femoral artery which wa free of significant atherosclerotic plaque, and an arteriotomy that wa suitable for a closure device. Then, a Perclose wa used to seal the right femoral arteriotomy.,HEMODYNAMIC DATA:, The opening aortic pressure wa 91/63. The left ventricular pressure wa 94/13 with an end-diastolic pressure of 24. Left ventricular ejection fraction wa not assessed, a ventriculogram wa not performed. The patient did have some elevated creatinine earlier in this hospital course which warranted limitation of contrast where possible.,CORONARY ANGIOGRAM:, The left main coronary artery wa angiographically okay. The LAD had mild diffuse disease. There appeared to be distal tapering of the LAD. The left circumflex had mild diffuse disease. In the very distal aspect of the circumflex after OM-3 and OM-4 type branch, there wa a long, severely diseased segment that appeared to be chronic and subtotal in one area. The runoff from this area appeared to be a very small PLOM type branch and continuation of a circ which did not appear to supply much territory, and there wa not much to salvage by approaching this lesion. The right coronary artery had mild diffuse disease. The PLV branch wa 100% occluded at it ostium at the crux. The PDA at the ostium had an 80% stenosis. The PDA wa a fairly sizeable vessel with a long course. The right coronary is dominant.,CONCLUSION:, Mild diffuse coronary artery disease with severe distal left circumflex lesion with not much runoff beyond this lesion. This circumflex appears to be chronically diseased and ha area that appear to be subtotal. There is a 100% PLV branch which is also chronic and reported in his angiogram in the 1990s. There is an ostial 80% right PDA lesion. The plan is to proceed with percutaneous intervention to the right PDA.,The case wa then progressed to percutaneous intervention of the right PDA. A 6-French JR4 guide catheter with side hole wa selected and used to engage the right coronary artery ostium. The lesion wa crossed with a long BMW 0.014 guidewire. Then, we ballooned the lesion with a 2.5 x 9 mm Maverick balloon. Subsequently, we stented the lesion with a 2.5 x 16 mm Taxus drug-eluting stent with a nice angiographic result. The patient tolerated the procedure very well, without complications.,ANGIOPLASTY CONCLUSION:, Successful percutaneous intervention with drug-eluting stent placement to the ostium of the PDA.,RECOMMENDATIONS:, Aspirin indefinitely, and Plavix 75 mg p.o. daily for no le than six months.

She agreed to proceed.  A full informed consent wa obtained.,PROCEDURE: , The patient presented to ABCD General Hospital on 09/04/2003 with the history wa reviewed and physical examination wa evaluated.  The patient wa brought by the Department of Anesthesiology, brought back to surgical suite and given IV access and general endotracheal anesthesia.  A 9 cc of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 of epinephrine wa infiltrated into the area of pre-demarcated above the suprasternal notch.  Time is allowed for full hemostasis to be achieved.  The patient wa then prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  A #10 blade wa then utilized to make an incision in the pre-demarcated and anesthetized area.  Unipolar electrocautery wa utilized for hemostasis.  Finger dissection wa carried out in the superior and inferior planes.  Platysma wa identified and dissected and a subplatysmal plane wa created in the superior and inferior, medial and lateral direction using hemostat, Metzenbaum, and blunt dissection.  The strap muscle were identified.  The midline raphe wa not easily identifiable at this time.  An incision wa made through what appeared to be in the midline raphe and dissection wa carried down to the thyroid.  Sternohyoid and sternothyroid muscle were identified and separated on the patient's right side and then subsequently on the left side.  It wa noted at this time that the thyroid lobule on the right side is a bi-lobule.  Kitner blunt dissection wa utilized to bluntly dissect the overlying thyroid fascia a well a strap muscle off the thyroid, force in the lateral direction.  This wa carried down to the inferior and superior areas.  The superior pole of the right lobule wa then identified.  A hemostat wa placed in the cricothyroid groove and a Kitner wa placed in this area.  A second Kitner wa placed on lateral aspect of the superior pole and the superior pole of the right thyroid wa retracted inferiorly.  Careful dissection wa then carried out in a very meticulous fashion in the superior lobe and identified the appropriate vessel and cauterized with bipolar or ligated with the suture ligature.  This wa carried out until the superior pole wa identified.  Careful attention wa made to avoid nerve injury in this area.  Dissection wa then carried down again bluntly separating the inferior and superior lobes.  The bilobed right thyroid wa then retracted medially.  The recurrent laryngeal nerve wa then identified and tracked to it insertion.  The overlying vessel of the middle thyroid vein a well a the associated structure were then identified and great attention wa made to perform a right careful meticulous dissection to remove the fascial attachment superficial to the recurrent laryngeal nerve off the thyroid.  When it wa completed, this lobule wa then removed from Berry's ligament.  There wa noted to be no isthmus at this time and the entire right lobule wa then sent to the Pathology for further evaluation.  Attention wa then diverted to the patient's left side.  In a similar fashion, the sternohyoid and sternothyroid muscle were already separated.  Army-Navy a well a femoral retractor were utilized to lateralize the appropriate musculature.  The middle thyroid vein wa identified.  Blunt dissection wa carried out laterally to superiorly once again.  A hemostat wa utilized to make an opening in the cricothyroid groove and a Kitner wa then placed in this area.  Another Kitner wa placed on the lateral aspect of the superior lobe of the left thyroid and retracted inferiorly.  Once again, a careful meticulous dissection wa utilized to identify the appropriate structure in the superior pole of the left thyroid and suture ligature a well a bipolar cautery wa utilized for hemostasis.  Once again, a careful attention wa made not to injure the nerve in this area.  The superior pole wa then freed appropriately and blunt dissection wa carried down to lateral and inferior aspects.  The inferior aspect wa then identified.  The inferior thyroid artery and vein were then identified and ligated.  The left thyroid wa then medialized and the recurrent laryngeal nerve ha been identified.  A careful dissection wa then carried out to remove the fascial attachment superficial to the recurrent laryngeal nerve on the side a close to the thyroid gland a possible.  The thyroid wa then removed from the Berry's ligament and it wa then sent to Pathology for further evaluation.  Evaluation of the visceral space did not reveal any bleeding at this time.  This wa irrigated and pinpoint area were bipolored a necessary.  Surgicel wa then placed bilaterally.  The strap muscle a well a the appropriate fascial attachment were then approximated with a #3-0 Vicryl suture in the midline.

However, we could not obtain 3 cc of blood from either the left foot or the left arm after multiple attempts, and therefore, we decided that the chance of cure of hyperparathyroidism by removal of this parathyroid adenoma wa high enough and the improvement in that chance of cure marginal enough that we would terminate the procedure without monitoring PTH.  The neck wa irrigated with saline and hemostasis found to be satisfactory.  The sternohyoid muscle were reapproximated with interrupted 4-0 Vicryl.  The platysma wa closed with interrupted 4-0 Vicryl, and the skin wa closed with subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Dermabond.

2132,"SUBJECTIVE: , This patient present to the office today with his mom for checkup.  He used to live in the city.  He used to go to college down in the city.  He got addicted to drugs.  He decided it would be a good idea to get away from the ""bad crowd"" and come up and live with his mom.  He ha a history of doing heroin.  He wa injecting into his vein.  He wa seeing a physician in the city.  They were prescribing methadone for some time.  He say that did help.  He wa on 10 mg of methadone.  He wa on it for three to four months.  He tried to wean down on the methadone a couple of different times, but failed.  He ha been intermittently using heroin.  He say one of the big problem is that he life in a household full of drug user and he could not get away from it.  All that changed now that he is living with his mom.  The last time he did heroin wa about seven to eight day ago.  He ha not had any methadone in about a week either.  He is coming in today specifically requesting methadone.  He also admits to being depressed.  He is sad a lot and down.  He doe not have much energy.  He doe not have the enthusiasm.  He denies any suicidal or homicidal ideation at the present time.

General:  He is nontoxic and in no acute distress.  Psychiatric:  Alert and oriented time 3.  Skin:  I examined his upper extremities.  He showed me his injection sites.  I can see marks, but they seem to be healing up nicely.  I do not see any evidence of cellulitis.  There is no evidence of necrotizing fasciitis.,ASSESSMENT: , Substance abuse.,PLAN: , I had a long talk with the patient and his mom.  I am not prescribing him any narcotic or controlled substances.  I am not in the practice of trading one addiction for another.  It ha been one week without any sort of drug at all.  I do not think he need weaning.  I think right now it is mostly psychological, although there still could be some residual physical addiction.  However, once again I do not believe it to be necessary to prescribe him any sort of controlled substance at the present time.  I do believe that his depression need to be treated.  I gave him fluoxetine 20 mg one tablet daily.  I discussed the side effect in detail.  I did also warn him that all antidepressant medication carry an increased risk of suicide.  If he should start to feel any of these symptoms, he should call #911 or go to the emergency room immediately.  If he ha any problem or side effects, he wa also directed to call me here at the office.  After-hours, he can go to the emergency room or call #911.  I am going to see him back in three week for the depression.  I gave him the name and phone number of Behavioral Health and I told him to call so that he can get into rehabilitation program or at least a support group.  We are unable to make a referral for him to do that.  He ha to call on his own.  He ha no insurance.  However, I think fluoxetine is very affordable.  He can get it for $4 per month at Wal-Mart.

A ________ wa then inserted over the femoral head purchasing of the acetabulum underneath the reflected head of the quadriceps muscle.  Once this wa performed, Homan retractor were then inserted superiorly and inferiorly underneath the femoral neck.  At this time, a capsulotomy wa then performed using a Bovie cautery and the capsulotomy wa ________ and then edged over the acetabulum.  At this point, a large bone hook wa then inserted over the neck and with gentle traction and external rotation, the femoral head wa dislocated out of the acetabulum.  At this time, we had an exposure of the femoral head, which did reveal degenerative change of the femoral head and once the acetabulum wa visualized, we did see degenerative change within the acetabulum a well a osteophyte formation around the rim of the acetabulum.  At this time, a femoral stem guide wa then used to measure proximal femoral neck cut.  We made a cut approximately a fingerbreadth above the lesser trochanter.  At this time, with protection of the soft tissue an oscillating saw wa used to make femoral neck cut.,The femoral head wa then removed.  At this time, we removed the leg out of the bag and Homan retractor were then used to expose the acetabulum.  A long-handle knife wa used to cut through the remainder of the capsule and remove the glenoid labrum around the rim of the acetabulum.  With better exposure of the acetabulum, we started reaming the acetabulum.  We started with a size #44 and progressively reamed to a size #50.  At the size #50 mm reamer, we obtained excellent bony bleeding with good remainder of bone stalk both anteriorly and posteriorly a well a superiorly within the acetabulum.  We then reamed up to size #52 in order to get bony bleeding around the rim a well a anterior and posterior within the acetabulum.  A size 54 mm Trilogy cup wa then implanted with excellent approach approximately 45 degree of abduction and 10 to 15 degree of anteversion dialed in.  Once the cup wa impacted in place, we did visualize that the cup wa well seated on to the internal portion of the acetabulum.  At this time, two screw were the placed within the superior table for better approach securing the acetabular cup.  At this time, a plastic liner wa then inserted for protection.  The leg wa then placed back in the bag.  A Bennett retractor wa used to retract the tensor fascia lata and femoral elevator wa used to elevate the femur for better exposure and at this time, we began working on the femur.  A rongeur wa used to lateralize over the greater trochanter.  A Box osteotome wa used to remove the cancellous portion of the femoral neck.  A Charnley awl wa then used to cannulate through the proximal femoral canal.  A power reamer wa then used to ream the lateral aspect of the greater trochanter in order to provide maximal lateralization and prevent varus implantation of our stem.  At this time, we began broaching.  We started with a size #10 and progressively worked up to a size #12 mm broach.  Once the 12 mm broach wa inserted in place, it wa seated approximately 1 mm below the calcar.  A calcar reamer wa then placed and the calcar wa reamed smoothly.  A standard neck a well a a 28 mm plastic head wa then placed and a trial reduction wa then performed.  Once this wa performed, the hip wa taken to range of motion with external rotation, longitudinal traction a well a flexion and revealed good stability with no impingement or dislocation.  At this time, we removed 12 mm broach and proceeded with implanting our polyethylene liner within the acetabulum.  This wa impacted and placed and checked to assure that it wa well seated with no loosening.  Once this wa performed, we then exposed the proximal femur one more time.  We copiously irrigated within the canal and then suctioned it dry.  At this time, a 12 mm porous proximal collared stem, a femoral component wa then impacted in place.  Once it wa well seated on the calcar, we double checked to assure that there wa no evidence of calcar fractures, which there were none.  The 28 mm zero neck length cobalt-chrome femoral head wa then impacted in place and the Morse taper assured that this wa well fixed by ________.,Next, the hip wa then reduced within the acetabulum and again we checked range of motion a well a ligamentous stability with gentle traction, external rotation, a well a hip flexion.  We were satisfied with component a well a the alignment of the components.  Copious irrigation wa then used to irrigate the wound.  #1 Ethibond wa then used to approximate the anterior hip capsule.  #1 Ethibond in interrupted fashion wa used to approximate the vastus lateralis a well a the gluteus medius attachment over the partial gluteus medius attachment which wa resected off the greater trochanter.  Next, a #1 Ethibond wa then used to approximate the tensor fascia lata with figure-of-eight closure.  A tight closure wa performed.  Since the patient did have a lot of subcutaneous fat, multiple #2-0 Vicryl suture were then used to approximate the bed space and then #2-0 Vicryl for the subcutaneous skin.  Staples were then used for skin closure.  The patient's hip wa then cleansed.  Sterile dressing consisting of Adaptic, 4 x 4, ABDs, and foam tape were then placed.  A drain wa placed prior to wound closure for postoperative drainage.  After the dressing wa applied, the patient wa extubated safely and transferred to recovery in stable condition.  Prognosis is good. ",2.0

The left ear laceration deformity wa very close to the bottom of her ear and therefore it wa transected through the centrifugal edge of the ear lobe and pared.  The marsupialized epithelialized tract were pared to raw tissue.  They were pared in a fashion to create a Y-V plasty with de-epithelialization of the distal V and overlap of the undermined from the proximal cephalad edge.  The 5-0 chromic suture were used to approximate anteriorly, posteriorly, and anterior centrifugal edge in the Y-V plasty fashion to decrease the risk of notching.  Bacitracin, Band-Aid wa placed.  Next, attention wa turned to the contralateral ear where an elongated laceration deformity wa pared of the marsupialized epithelialized edge anteriorly, posteriorly to create raw edges.  This wa not taken through the edge of the lobe to decrease the risk of notch deformity.  The laceration wa repaired anteriorly and posteriorly in a pleated fashion to decrease length of the incision and to decrease any deformity toward the edge or any dog-ear deformity toward the edge.  The 5-0 chromic suture were used in interrupted fashion for this.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Band-Aid and bacitracin were placed.  She left the operating room in stable condition.

We tactfully discussed the patient's diagnosis with her, and she felt reassured.  We told her that this most likely wa in the earlier stage of disease and she would benefit from trying Aricept.  She stated that she did not have the prescription anymore from her outpatient neurology consult for the Aricept, so we wrote her another prescription for Aricept.  The patient herself seemed very concerned about the stigma of the disease, but our lengthy discussion, expressed genuine understanding a to why her outpatient physician had reported her to DMV.  It wa explicitly told to not drive by her outpatient neurologist and we concur with this assessment.  She will follow up with u in the next six month and will call u if she ha any problem with the Aricept.  She wa written for Aricept to start at 5 mg for three weeks, and if she ha no side effect which typically are GI side effects, then she can go up to 10 mg a day.  We also reviewed with Ms. A the finding for outpatient MRI, which showed some mild atrophy per report and also that her metabolic workup, which included an RPR, TSH, and B12 were all within normal limits., ",1.0

Once this wa done, the skin wa then incised around the coronal cuff with 15-blade knife and further extended with the curved tenotomy scissors to deglove the penis.  On the ventrum, the chordee tissue wa removed and dissected up towards the urethral plate to use a secondary tissue flap coverage.  Once this wa done, an electrocautery wa used for hemostasis were then used.  A vessel loop tourniquet and IV grade saline wa used for achieve artificial erection and chordee.  We then incised Buck fascia at the area of chordee in the ventrum and then used the #5-0 Prolene a a Heinecke-Mikulicz advancement suture.  Sutures were placed burying the knot and then artificial erection wa again performed showing the penis wa straight.  We then left the tourniquet in place, although loosened it slightly and then marked out the transurethral incision plate with demarcation for the glans and the ventral midline of the plate.

Once this wa completed, the glans itself had been rolled using two deep suture of #5-0 Vicryl.  Interrupted suture of #7-0 Vicryl were used to create the neomeatus and then horizontal mattress suture of #7-0 Vicryl used to roll the glans in the midline.  The extra dorsal hood tissue of preputial skin wa then excised.  An interrupted suture of #6-0 chromic were then used to approximate penile shaft skin to the coronal cuff and on the ventrum around the midline.  The patient's scrotum wa slightly asymmetric; however, this wa due to the tissue configuration of the scrotum itself.  At the end of the procedure, stay suture of #4-0 Prolene wa used to tack the drain into place and a Dermabond and Surgicel were used for dressing.  Telfa and the surgical eye tape wa then used for the final dressing.  IV Toradol wa given.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and wa in stable condition upon transfer to recovery room. ",2.0

If the patient ha indeed testicular torsion, there is an increased possibility that it may reoccur again, actually within the first 24 to 36 hour and a such is recommended doing a left scrotal exploration with possible detorsion of left testis, possible orchiectomy if the testis is markedly abnormal or nonviable, which probably is not the case, and bilateral testis fixation if the torsion is found.  I discussed the pre and postsurgical care with the parents.  Procedure itself with potential complications, risks, benefits, and alternative of surgery including that the torsion could occur again, although it is le likely after the surgical fixation procedure.

The conjoint tendon wa identified on the lateral plantar aspect of the base of the proximal phalanx of the left great toe and transversally resected from it insertion.  A lateral capsulotomy wa also performed at the level of the first left metatarsophalangeal joint.  The dorsomedial prominence of the first left metatarsal head wa adequately exposed using sharp dissection and resected with the use of a sagittal saw.  The same saw wa used to perform an Austin-type bunionectomy on the capital aspect of the first left metatarsal head with it apex distal and it base proximal on the shaft of the first left metatarsal.  The dorsal arm of the osteotomy wa longer than the plantar arm in order to accommodate for the future internal fixation.  The capital fragment of the first left metatarsal wa then transposed laterally and impacted on the shaft of the first left metatarsal.  Provisional fixation wa achieved with two smooth wire that were inserted vertically to the dorsal osteotomy in a dorsal distal to plantar proximal direction.  The same wire were also used a guide wire for the insertion of a 16-mm and an 18-mm partially threaded screw from the 3.0 OsteoMed System upon insertion of the screws, which wa accomplished using AO technique.  The wire were removed.  Fixation on the table wa found to be excellent.  Reduction of the bunion deformity wa also found to be excellent and position of the first left metatarsophalangeal joint wa anatomical.  The remaining bony prominence from the shaft of the first left metatarsal wa then resected with a sagittal saw.  The area wa copiously flushed with saline.  The periosteal and capsular tissue were approximated with 2-0 and 3-0 Vicryl suture material, 4-0 Vicryl wa used to approximate the subcutaneous tissues.  The incision site wa reinforced with Steri-Strips.  At this time, the patient's left ankle tourniquet wa deflated.  The time wa 45 minutes.  Immediate hyperemia wa noted to the entire right lower extremity upon deflation of the cuff.  The patient's incision wa covered with Xeroform, copious amount of fluff and Kling, stockinette, and an Ace bandage.  The patient's left foot wa then placed in a surgical shoe.  The patient wa then transferred to the recovered room under the care of the anesthesia team with her vital sign stable and her vascular status at appropriate levels.  The patient wa given pain medication and instruction on how to control her postoperative course.  The patient wa discharged from Hospital according to nursing protocol and wa advised to follow up with Dr. X in one week's time for her first postoperative appointment. ",2.0

There wa some evidence that surgical procedure had happened in the area nearby and also there wa collateral venous circulation under the skin, which made u suspicious that may be __________, but at any rate I tried to cannulate it subcutaneously and I wa unsuccessful.  Therefore, I proceeded to make an incision and wa able to isolate the vein, which would look very sclerotic.  I tried to cannulate it, but I could not advance the wire.,At that moment, I decided that there wa no way we are going to put a port though that area.  I packed the incision and we prepped and redraped the patient including both groins.  Local anesthetic wa infiltrated and then the left femoral vein wa percutaneously cannulated without any difficulty.  The introducer wa placed and then a wire and then the catheter of the double lumen port, which had been trimmed to position it near the heart.  It wa done with radiological guidance.

The patient recently underwent a fistulogram with angioplasty at the proximal upper arm cephalic vein due to a stenosis detected on Duplex ultrasound.  The patient subsequently wa noted to have poor flow to the fistula, and the fistula wa difficult to palpate.  A repeat ultrasound wa performed which demonstrated a high-grade stenosis involving the distal upper arm cephalic vein just distal to the brachial anastomosis.  The patient present today for a left arm fistulogram with angioplasty.  The risks, benefits, and alternative of the procedure were discussed with the patient and understands and in agreement to proceed.,PROCEDURE DETAILS:  ,The patient wa brought to the angio suite and laid supine on the table.  After sedation wa administered, the left arm wa then prepped and draped in a standard surgical fashion.  Continuous pulse oximetry and cardiac monitoring were performed throughout the procedure.  The patient wa given 1 g of IV Ancef prior to incision.,The left brachiocephalic fistula wa visualized with bevel ultrasound.  The cephalic vein in the proximal upper arm region appeared to be of adequate caliber.  There wa an area of stenosis at the proximal cephalic vein just distal to the brachial artery anastomosis.  The cephalic vein in the proximal forearm region wa easily compressible.  The skin overlying the vessel wa injected with 1% lidocaine solution.  A small incision wa made with the #11 blade.  The cephalic vein then wa cannulated with a 5 French micropuncture introducer sheath.  The sheath wa advanced over the wire.  A fistulogram wa performed which demonstrated a high-grade stenosis just distal to the brachial artery anastomosis.  The introducer sheath wa then exchanged for a 5 French sheath over a 0.025 guide wire.  The sheath wa aspirated and flushed with heparinized saline solution.  A 0.025 glidewire wa then obtained and advanced, placed over the sheath and across the area of stenosis into the brachial artery.  A 5 French short Kumpe catheter wa used to guide the wire into the distal brachial and radial artery.  After crossing the area of stenosis, a 5 x 20 mm standard angioplasty balloon wa obtained and prepped from the back table.  This wa placed over the glidewire into the area of stenosis and inflated to 14 mmHg pressure and then deflated.  The balloon wa then removed over the wire and repeat fistulogram wa performed which demonstrated significant improvement.  However, there is still a remainder of residual stenosis.  The 5-mm balloon wa placed over the wire again and a repeat angioplasty wa performed.  The balloon wa then removed over the wire and a repeat angiogram wa performed which demonstrated again an area of stenosis right at the anastomosis.  The glidewire wa removed and a 0.014 guide wire wa then obtained and placed through the sheath and across the brachial anastomosis and into the radial artery.  A 4 x 20 mm cutting balloon wa obtained and prepped on the back table.  The 5 French sheath wa then exchanged for a 6 French sheath.  The balloon wa then placed over the 0.014 guide wire into the area of stenosis and then inflated to normal pressure at 8 mmHg.  The balloon wa then deflated and removed over the wire.  A 5 mm x 20 mm balloon wa obtained and prepped and placed over the wire into the area of stenosis and inflated to pressure of 14 mmHg.  A repeat fistulogram wa performed after the removal of the balloon which demonstrated excellent result with no significant residual stenosis.  The patient actually had a nice palpable thrill at this point.  The fistulogram of the distal cephalic vein at the subclavian anastomosis wa performed which demonstrated a mild area of stenosis.  The sheath wa removed and blood pressure wa held over the puncture site for approximately 10 minutes.,After hemostasis wa achieved, the cephalic vein again wa visualized with bevel ultrasound.  The proximal cephalic vein wa then cannulated after injecting the skin overlying the vessel with a 1% lidocaine solution.  A 5 French micropuncture introducer sheath wa then placed over the wire into the proximal cephalic vein.  A repeat fistulogram wa performed which demonstrated an area of stenosis within the distal cephalic vein just prior to the subclavian vein confluence.  The 5 French introducer sheath wa then exchanged for a 5 French sheath.  The 5 mm x 20 mm balloon wa placed over a 0.035 glidewire across the area of stenosis.  The balloon wa inflated to 14 mmHg.  The balloon wa then deflated and a repeat fistulogram wa performed through the sheath which demonstrated good results.

Left ventriculogram.,6.  Aortogram.,7.  Percutaneous intervention of the left circumflex and obtuse marginal branch with plano balloon angioplasty unable to pas stent.,NARRATIVE:,  After all risk and benefit were explained to the patient, informed consent wa obtained.  The patient wa brought to the cardiac catheterization suite.  The right groin wa prepped in the usual sterile fashion.  Right common femoral artery wa cannulated using a modified Seldinger technique and a long 6-French AO sheath wa introduced secondary to tortuous aorta.  Next, Judkins left catheter wa used to engage the left coronary system.  Cineangiography wa recorded in multiple views.  Next, Judkins right catheter wa used to engage the right coronary system.  Cineangiography wa recorded in multiple views.  Next, the Judkins right catheter wa used to engage the SVG to OM.  Cineangiography wa recorded.  Next, the Judkins right wa advanced into the left subclavian and exchanged over a long exchange length J-wire for a 4-French left internal mammary artery which wa used to engage the LIMA graft to LAD and cineangiography wa recorded in multiple views.  Next, an angled pigtail catheter wa advanced into the left ventricular cavity.  LV pressure were measured.  LV gram wa done and a pullback gradient across the aortic valve wa done and recorded.  Next, an aortogram wa done and recorded.  At this point, I decided to proceed with percutaneous intervention of the left circumflex.  Therefore, AVA 3.5 guide wa used to engage the left coronary artery.  Angiomax bolus and drip wa started.  Universal wire wa advanced past the lesion and a 2.5-balloon wa advanced first to the proximal lesion and predilations were done at 14 atmosphere and then to the distal lesion and predilatation wa done at 12 atmospheres.  Next, we attempted to advance a 3.0 x 12 stent to the distal lesion; however, we were unable to pas the stent.  Next, second dilatation were done again with the 2.5 balloon at 18 atmospheres; however, we are unable to break the lesion.  We next attempted a cutting balloon.  Again, we are unable to cross the lesion, therefore a buddy wire technique wa used with a PT choice support wire.  Again, we were unable to cross the lesion with the stent.  We then try to cross with a noncompliant balloon, which we were unsuccessful.  We also try to cutting balloon again, we were unsuccessful.  Despite multiple dilatations, we were unable to cross anything beyond the noncompliant balloon across the lesion; therefore, finally the procedure wa aborted.  Final image showed no evidence of dissection, perforation, or further complication.  The right groin wa filled after taking an image to confirm sheath placement above the bifurcation with excellent results.  The patient tolerated the procedure very well without complications, wa taken off the operating table and transferred back to cardiac telemetry floor.,DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS,1.  The LV.  LVEDP wa 4.  LVES is approximately 50%-55% with inferobasal hypokinesis.  No significant MR. No gradient across the aortic valve.,2.  Aortogram.  The ascending aorta show no significant dilatation or evidence of dissection.  The valve show no significant aortic insufficiencies.  The abdominal aorta and distal aorta show significant tortuosities.,3.  The left main.  The left main coronary artery is a large caliber vessel, bifurcating the LAD and left circumflex with some mild distal disease of about 10%-20%.,4.  Left circumflex.  The left circumflex vessel is a large caliber vessel give off a distal branching obtuse marginal branch.  The upper pole of the OM show retrograde filling of the distal graft and also at that point approximately a 70%-80% stenosis.  The mid left circumflex is a high-grade 80% diffuse tortuous stenosis.,5.  LAD.  The LAD is a totally 100% occluded vessel.  The LIMA to LAD is patent with only a small-to-moderate caliber LAD.  There is a large diagonal branch coming off the proximal portion of the LAD and that proximal LAD showed some diffuse disease upwards of 60%-70%.  The diagonal show proximal 80% stenosis.,6.  The right coronary artery:  The right coronary artery is 100% occluded.  There are retrograde collateral from left to right to the distal PDA and PLV branches.  The SVG to OM is 100% occluded at it take off.  The SVG to PDA is not found; however, presumed 100% occluded given that there is collateral flow to the distal right.,7.  LIMA to LAD is widely patent.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , Attempted intervention to the left circumflex system, only able to perform plano balloon angioplasty, unable to pas stents, noncompliant balloon or cutting balloon.  Final image showed some improvement, however, continued residual stenosis.  At this point, the patient will be transferred back to telemetry floor and monitored.  We can attempt future intervention or continue aggressive medical management.  The patient continues to have residual stenosis in the diagonal; however, due to the length of this procedure, I did not attempt intervention to that diagonal branch.  Possible consideration would be a stress test a an outpatient depending on where patient show ischemia, focus on treatment to that lesion. ",2.0

A pursestring suture of 3-0 Prolene wa placed around the needle in the paraspinous muscle.  The needle wa withdrawn.  The pursestring suture wa tied to snug the tissue around the catheter and prevent cerebrospinal fluid leak.  The catheter demonstrated free flow of cerebrospinal fluid,throughout the RV procedure.  The catheter wa anchored to the paraspinous muscle with an anchoring device using interrupted suture of 3-0 Prolene.  Antibiotic irrigation and antibiotic soak sponge were placed into the wound, and the catheter wa clamped to prevent persistent leakage of cerebrospinal fluid while the SynchroMed-pump pocket wa created.  Then, I turned my attention to the anterior abdominal wall where an oblique incision wa made and carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue to the external oblique fascia, which wa freed from attachment to the overlying subcutaneous tissue utilizing blunt and sharp dissection with electrocautery.  A pocket wa created that would encompass the SynchroMed fusion pump.  A tunneling device wa then passed through the subcutaneous tissue from the back incision to the abdominal incision, and a SynchroMed pump catheter wa placed to the tunneling device.  The tunneling device wa then removed leaving the SynchroMed pump catheter extending from the anterior abdominal wall incision to the posterior back incision.  The intrathecal catheter wa trimmed.  A clear plastic boot wa placed over the intrathecal catheter, and the connecting device wa advanced from the SynchroMed pump catheter into the intrathecal catheter connecting the 2 catheter together.  The clear plastic boot wa then placed over the connection, and it wa anchored in place with 0-silk ties.  Good CSF wa then demonstrated flowing through the SynchroMed pump catheter.  The SynchroMed pump catheter wa connected to the SynchroMed pump and anchored in place with a 0-silk tie.  Excess catheter wa coiled and placed behind the pump.  The pump wa placed into the subcutaneous pocket created for it on the anterior abdominal wall.  The pump wa anchored to the anterior abdominal wall fascia with interrupted suture of 2-0 Prolene; 4 of the suture were placed.  The subcutaneous tissue were irrigated with normal saline.  The subcutaneous tissue of both wound wa closed with running suture of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin of both wound wa closed with staples.  Antibiotic ointment and a sterile dressing were applied.  The patient wa awake and taken to the recovery room.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and wa stable at the completion of the procedure.  All sponge and lap, needle and instrument count were correct at the completion of the procedure. ",2.0

The leg wa exsanguinated by gravity and pneumatic tourniquet wa inflated to 300 mmHg.,A straight anterior incision wa carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Unilateral flap were developed and a median retinacular parapatellar incision wa made. The extensor mechanism wa partially divided and the patella wa everted. Some of the femoral bone spur were resected using an osteotome and a rongeur. Ascending drill hole wa made in the distal femur and the distal femoral cut, anterior and posterior and chamfer cut were accomplished for a 67.5 femoral component.,At this point the ACL wa resected. Some of the fat pad and synovium were resected, a well a both medial and lateral menisci. A posterior cruciate retractor wa utilized, the tibia brought forward and a centering drill hole made in the tibia. The intramedullary guide wa used for cutting the tibia. It wa set at 8 mm. An additional 2 mm wa resected because of a moderate defect medially.,A trial reduction wa done with a 71 tibial baseplate. This wa pinned and drilled and then trial reduction done with a 10-mm insert.,This gave good stability and a full range of motion.,The patella wa measured with the caliber and 9 mm of bone wa resected with an oscillating saw. A 34-mm component wa drilled for.,A further trial reduction wa done and two liter of pulse lavage were used to clean the bony surfaces. A packet of cement wa hand mixed, pressurized with a spatula into the proximal tibia. Multiple drill hole were made on the medial side of the tibia where the bone wa somewhat sclerotic. The tibia baseplate wa secured and the patella wa inserted, held with a clamp. The extraneous cement wa removed. At this point the tibial baseplate wa locked into place and the femoral component also seated solidly.,The knee wa extended, held in this position for another 5-6 minute until the cement wa cured. Further extraneous cement wa removed. The pneumatic tourniquet wa released, hemostasis wa obtained with electrocoagulation.,Retinaculum, quadriceps and extensor were repaired with multiple figure-of-eight #1 Vicryl sutures, the subcutaneous tissue with 2-0 and the skin with skin staples.

1381,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Right pectoralis major tendon rupture.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Right pectoralis major tendon rupture.,OPERATION PERFORMED: , Open repair of right pectoralis major tendon.,ANESTHESIA:,  General with an interscalene block.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,Needle and sponge count were done and correct.,INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  ,The patient is a 26-year-old right hand dominant male who work in sales, who wa performing heavy bench press exercise when he felt a tearing burning pain severe in his right shoulder.  The patient presented with mild bruising over the proximal arm of the right side with x-ray showing no fracture.  Over concern for pectoralis tendon tear, he wa sent for MRI evaluation where a complete rupture of a portion of the pectoralis major tendon wa noted.  Due to the patient's young age and active lifestyle surgical treatment wa recommended in order to obtain best result.  The risk and benefit of the procedure were discussed in detail with the patient including, but not limited to scarring, infection, damage to blood vessel and nerves, re-rupture, need further surgery, loss of range of motion, inability to return to heavy activity such a weight lifting, complex usual pain syndrome, and deep vein thrombosis a well a anesthetic risks.  Understanding all risk and benefits, the patient desire to proceed with surgery a planned.,FINDINGS:,1.  Following deltopectoral approach to the right shoulder, the pectoralis major tendon wa encountered.  The clavicular head wa noted to be intact.  There wa noted to be complete rupture of the sternal head of the pectoralis major tendon with an oblique-type tear having some remaining cuff on the humerus and some tendon attached to the retracted portion.,2.  Following freeing of adhesion using track and sutures, the pectoralis major tendon wa able to reapproximated to it insertion site on the humerus just lateral to the biceps.,3.  A soft tissue repair wa performed with #5 FiberWire suture and a single suture anchor of 5 x 5 bioabsorbable anchor wa placed in order to decrease tension at the repair site.  Following repair of soft tissue and using the bone anchor, there wa noted to be good apposition of the tendon with edge and a solid repair.,OPERATIVE REPORT IN DETAIL: , The patient wa identified in the preop holding area.  His right shoulder wa identified, marked his appropriate surgical site after verification with the patient.  He wa then taken to the operating room where he wa transferred to the operative table in supine position and placed under general anesthesia by anesthesiology team.  He then received prophylactic antibiotics.  A time-out wa then undertaken verifying the correct patient, extremity, surgery performed, administration of antibiotics, and the availability of equipment.  At this point, the patient wa placed to a modified beech chair position with care taken to ensure all appropriate pressure point were padded and there wa no pressure over the eyes.  The right upper extremity wa then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Preoperative marking were still visible at this point.  A deltopectoral incision wa made utilizing the inferior portion.  Dissection wa carried down.  The deltoid wa retracted laterally.  The clavicular head of the pectoralis major wa noted to be intact with the absence of the sternal insertion.  There wa a small cuff of tissue left on the proximal humerus associated with the clavicular head.  Gentle probing medially revealed the end of the sternal retracted portion, traction suture of #5 Ethibond were used in this to allow for retraction and freeing from light adhesion.  This allowed reapproximation of the retracted tendon to the tendon stump.  At this point, a repair using #5 FiberWire wa then performed of the pectoralis major tendon back to stump on the proximal humerus noting good apposition of the tendon edge and no gapping of the repair site.  At this point, a single metal suture anchor wa attempted to be implanted just lateral to the insertion of the pectoralis in order to remove tension off the repair site; however, the inserted device attached to the metal anchor broke during insertion due to significant hardness of the bone.  For this reason, the starting hole wa tapped and a 5x5 bioabsorbable anchor wa placed, doubly loaded.  The suture were then weaved through the lateral aspect of the torn tendon and a modified Krackow type performed and sutured thereby relieving tension off the soft tissue repair.  At this point, there wa noted to be excellent apposition of the soft tissue end and a solid repair to gentle manipulation.  Aggressive external rotation wa not performed.  The wound wa then copiously irrigated.  The cephalic vein wa not injured during the case.  The skin wa then closed using a 2-0 Vicryl followed by a 3-0 subcuticular Prolene suture with Steri-Strips.  Sterile dressing wa then placed.  Anesthesia wa then performed, interscalene block.  The patient wa then awakened from anesthesia and transported to postanesthesia care in stable condition in a shoulder immobilizer with the arm adducted and internally rotated.,Plan for this patient, the patient will remain in the shoulder immobilizer until followup visit in approximately 10 days.  We will then start a gentle Codman type exercise and having limited motion until the 4-6 week point based on the patient's progression. ",2.0

Removal total shoulder arthroplasty (uncemented humeral Biomet component; cemented glenoid component).,3.  Implantation of antibiotic beads, left shoulder.,INDICATION FOR SURGERY: , The patient wa seen multiple time preoperatively and found to have finding consistent with a chronic and indolent infections.  Risks and benefit have been discussed with him and his family at length including but not exclusive of continued infection, nerve or artery damage, stiffness, loss of range of motion, incomplete relief of pain, incomplete return of function, fractures, loss of bone, medical complications, surgical complications, transfusion related complications, etc.  The patient understood and wished to proceed.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS: , Presumed infection, left total shoulder arthroplasty.,POSTOP DIAGNOSES:  ,1.  Deep extensive infection, left total shoulder arthroplasty.,2.  Biceps tenosynovitis.,3.  Massive rotator cuff tear in left shoulder (full thickness subscapularis tendon rupture 3 cm x 4 cm; supraspinatus tendon rupture 3 cm x 3 cm; infraspinatus tear 2 cm x 2 cm).,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient wa anesthetized in the supine position, a Foley catheter wa placed in his bladder.  He wa then placed Beach chair position and all bony prominence were well padded.  Pillows were placed around his knee to protect his sciatic nerve.  He wa brought to the side of the table and secured with towel and tape.  The head wa placed in neutral position with no lateral bending or extension to protect the brachioplexus from any stretch.  Left upper extremity wa then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  Unfortunately, preoperative antibiotic were given prior to the procedure.  This occurred due to lack of communication between the surgical staff and the anesthesia staff.  The patient's extremity, however, wa prepped a second time with a chlorhexidine prep after he had been draped.  Also, Ioban bandage were placed securely to the skin to prevent any further introduction of infection into his shoulder.,Deltopectoral incision wa then made.  The patient's had a cephalic vein, it wa identified and protected throughout the case.  It wa retracted laterally and once this ha been completed, the deltopectoral interval wa developed a carefully a possible.  The patient did have significant scar from this point on and did bleed from many surface throughout the case.  As a result, he wa transfused 1 unit postoperatively.  He did not have any problem during the case except for one small drop of blood pressure.  However this wa due primarily because of the extensive scarring of his proximal humerus.  He had scar between the anterior capsular structure and the conjoint tendon.  Also there wa significant scar between the deltoid and the proximal humerus.  The deltoid wa very carefully and tediously removed from the proximal humerus in order not to damage the axillary nerve.  Once the plane between the deltoid and underlying tissue wa found, the proximal humerus wa discovered to have a large defect, approximately 4 x 3.  This wa covered by rimmed fibrous tissue which wa fairly compressible, which felt to be purulent, however, when the needle wa stuck into this area, there wa no return of fluid.  As a result, this wa finally opened and found to have fibrinous exudate which appeared to be old congealed, purulent material.  There wa some suggestion of a synovitis type reaction also inside this cystic area.  This wa all debrided but wa found to track all the way into the proximal humerus from the lateral femoral component and also tracked posteriorly through and around the posterior cortex of the proximal humerus indicating that the infraspinatus probably had some tearing and detachment.  This later proved to be the case and infraspinatus did indeed have a tear 2 cm x 2 cm.  All of the mucinous material and fibrinous material wa removed from the proximal humerus.  This wa fairly extensive debridement.  All of this wa sent to pathology and also sent for culture and sensitivity.  It should be noted that Gram stain became a multiple white blood cell but no organism seen.  The pathology came back a fibrinous material with multiple white cells, also with sign of chronic inflammation consistent with an infection.,Attention wa then directed towards the anterior structure to gain access to the joint so that we could dislocate the prosthesis and remove it.  There wa also cystic area in the anterior aspect of the shoulder which wa fairly fibrinous.  This wa also removed.  Once this wa removed, though the capsule wa found to be very thin, there wa essentially no subscapularis tendon whatsoever.  It should also noted the patient's proximal humerus wa subluxed superiorly so that there wa no supraspinatus tendon present whatsoever.  As a result, the biceps tendon wa finally identified just below the pectoralis tendon insertion.  The upper 1 or 2 cm of the pectoralis insertion wa released in order to find the biceps.  It wa tracked proximally and transverse ligament released.  The biceps tendon wa flat and somewhat erythematous.  As a result, it released and tagged with an 0 Vicryl suture.  It wa later tenodesed to the conjoint tendon using 2-0 Prolene sutures.  The joint wa then entered and noted significant synovitis throughout the entire glenoid.  This wa all very carefully removed using a rongeur and sharp dissection.,Next, the humeral component wa removed and this wa done by attempting to remove it with the slap hammer and device which come with the Biomet set.  Unfortunately, this device would not hold the proximal humerus and we could not get the component to release.  As a result, bone contact of the metal proximally wa released using a straight osteotome.  Once this wa completed, another attempt wa made to remove the prosthesis but this only resulted in fracture of the proximal humerus through the area of erosion of the infection and once this ha been completed, we abandoned use of that particular device and using a __________ , we were able to hit the prosthesis lip from beneath and essentially remove it.  There wa no cement.  There wa exudate within the canal which wa removed using a curette.,Using fluoroscopy, sequential reamer were placed to a size of 11 distally down the shaft to remove the exudate.  This wa also thoroughly irrigated with irrigation antibiotic, and impregnated irrigation to decrease any risk of infection.  It should be noted that the reaming wa done fluoroscopically to make sure that there wa no penetration of the canal at any point.,The attention wa then directed to the glenoid.  The glenoid component wa very carefully dissected free and found to be very loose.  It wa essentially removed with digital dissection.  There wa no remaining cement in the cavity itself.  The patient's glenoid wa very carefully debrided.  The glenoid itself wa found to be very cup shaped with significant amount of bone loss in the central portion of the canal itself.  This wa debrided using rongeurs and curette until there wa no purulent exudate present anywhere in the glenoid itself.,Next, the entire wound wa irrigated thoroughly with 9 liter of antibiotic impregnated irrigation.  Rather than place a spacer, it wa elected to use antiobiotic beads.  This wa with antibiotic impregnated cement with one package with 3 gram of vancomycin.  These bead were then connected using Prolene and placed into the glenoid cavity itself, also some were placed in the greater tuberosity region.  These three did not have a Prolene attached to them.  The one placed down the canal did have a Prolene used a did the one placed in the cavity of the glenoid itself.,The biceps tendon wa then tenodesed under tension to the conjoint tendon.  There wa essentially no capsule left purely to close over the proximal humerus.  It wa electively the proximal humerus.  A portion of bone intact because it did have some bleeding surfaces.  Deltopectoral wa then closed with 0-Vicryl sutures, the deep subcutaneous tissue with 0-Vicryl sutures, superficial subcutaneous tissue with 2-0 Vicryl sutures.  Skin wa closed with staples.  A sterile bandage wa applied along with a cold therapy device and shoulder immobilizer.  The patient wa sent to recovery room in stable and satisfactory condition.,It should be noted that __________ is being requested for this case.  This wa a significantly scarred patient which required extra dissection and attention.  Even though this wa a standard revision case due to infection, there wa a significant more decision making and technical challenge in this case and this wa present for typical revision case.  Similarly, this case took approximately 30 to 40% more length of time due to bleeding and the attention to hemostasis.  The blood loss and operative finding indicates that this case wa at least 30 to 40% more challenging than a standard total shoulder or revision case.  This is being dictated for insurance purpose only and reflects no inherent difficulty with the case whatsoever. ",2.0

A NexGen femoral component with a distal femoral augmented block, size 5 mm.  A NexGen tibial component, size 3 mm wa used.  A size 14 mm constrained polyethylene surface wa used a well.  Original patellar component that the patient had wa maintained.,COMPLICATIONS:  ,None.,BRIEF HISTORY:,  The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of knee pain for 13 years.  She had previous total knee arthroplasty and revision at an outside facility.  She had continued pain, snapping, malalignment, difficulty with ambulation, and giving away and wished to undergo additional revision surgery.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient wa taken to the operative suite and placed on the operating table.  Department of Anesthesia administered the spinal anesthetic.  Once adequately anesthetized, the patient wa placed in a supine position.  Care wa ensured and she wa adequately secured and well padded in position.  Once this wa obtained, the right lower extremity wa prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Tourniquet wa inflated to approximately 325 mmHg on the right thigh.  At this point, an incision wa made over her anterior previous knee scar taking this down to the subcutaneous tissue of the overlying retinaculum.  A medial parapatellar arthrotomy wa then made by using a second knife and this wa taken both distally and proximally to allow u to sublux the patella on the lateral aspect to allow exposure to the joint surface.  There wa noted to be no evidence of purulence or gross clinical appearance of infection, however, intraoperative culture were taken to ass this a well.  At this point, the previous articular surface wa then removed using an osteotome until this wa left free and then removed.  This wa done without difficulty.  Attention wa then directed removing the femoral component.  Osteotome wa taken around each of the edge until this wa gently lifted up and then a femoral extractor wa placed around it and this wa back flapped until this wa easily removed.  After this wa performed, attention wa then directed to the tibial component.  An osteotome wa again inserted around the surface and this wa easily pried loose.  There wa noted to be minimal difficulty with this and did not appear to have adequate cement fixation.  This wa evaluated.  The bone stalk appeared to be adequate, however, there were noted to be some deficit where we need to trim cement, so we elected to proceed with stemmed component.  The attention wa first directed to the femur and the femoral canal wa opened up and superficially reamed up to a size 18 mm proximal portion for the Zimmer stemmed component.  At this point, the distal femoral cut wa evaluated with a intramedullary guide and this wa noted to be cut in a varus cut leaving u a large deficit of the medial femoral cut.  We elected because of this large amount of retic to take off the medial condyle to correct this varus cut to a six degree valgus cut.  We elected to augment the medial aspect and take only 5 mm off of the lateral condyle instead of a full 10 to 12.  At this point, the distal femoral cutting guide based on the intramedullary head wa then placed.  Care wa ensured that this wa aligned in proper rotation with the external epicondylar axis.  Once this wa pinned in position, approximately a six degree valgus cut wa then made.  This allowed a portion of the medial condyle to be removed distally.  The anterior cut wa checked next using the intramedullary guide.  The anterior surface cutting block wa then placed.  This aligned u to anterior cutting block.,We ensured again that rotation wa aligned with the epicondylar axis.  Once this wa adequately aligned with this and gave u some external rotation, this wa pinned in position and new anterior cut wa made.  It wa noted that minimal bone wa taken off the surface, only a slight portion on the medial anterior surface.  _______ wa then removed and the chamfer cutting guide wa then placed on.  This allowed u to make a box cut and recut some of the angled cut of the distal femur.  Once this wa placed and pinned in position.  Care wa then again taken to check that this wa in proper rotation and then the chamfer cut were recut.  It wa noted that the anterior chamfer did not need to be cut, take off no bone.  The posterior chamfer did remove some bony aspects.  This wa also taken off some of the posterior aspect of the condyle and then the ossicle saw and reciprocal saw were used to take off a notch cut to open up a constrained component.  After all these cut were taken, the guide were then removed and the trial component with a medial 5 mm augment wa then placed.  This appeared to have an adequate fit and then packed in position.  It appeared to be satisfactory.  At this point, this wa removed and attention wa then directed to the tibia.  The intramedullary canal wa again opened up using a proximal drill and this wa reamed to the appropriate size until good _______ wa obtained.  At this point, the intramedullary guide wa used to evaluate a tibial cut.  This appeared to be adequate, however, we elected to remove 2 mm of bone to give u a new fresh bony surface.  The cutting guide wa placed in adequate alignment and checked both the with intramedullary guide and an external alignment rod, which allowed u to ensure that we had proper external rotation of this tibial component.  At this point, this wa pinned in position and the tibial cut wa made to remove an extra 2 mm of bone.  This wa again removed and a trial tibial stemmed component wa then placed a well a the trial augmented stemmed femoral component.  This wa placed in a proper position.  A 10 mm articular surface wa placed in the knee and this wa taken through range of motion.  This wa found to have better alignment and satisfactory position.  We elected to take an intraoperative x-ray at this point, to evaluate our cut.  The intraoperative x-ray demonstrates satisfactory cut and alignment of the prosthesis.  At this point, all trial were removed.  The patella wa then examined.  The rongeur wa used to remove the surrounding synovium.  The patella wa evaluated and found to have mild wear on the lateral aspect of the inferior butt, however, this wa very mild and overall had a good position and wa well fixed to the bone.  It wa elected at this time to maintain this anatomic patella that wa previously placed.  At this point, the joint again wa reevaluated and any bone loose fragment removed.  There wa noted to be some posterior tightness and mild osteophytes.  These were removed with a rongeur.,At this time, while preparing the canals, the tourniquet wa deflated due to it being 123 minutes.  Approximately 10 minute did get by, a the knee wa copiously irrigated and suctioned dried.  The tourniquet wa then reinflated.  The canal were prepped for cementing.  They were suction-dried and cleaned.  The tibial component wa cemented and then impacted into position and ensured it wa adequately aligned in proper external rotation and alignment that wa previously tried with the trial.  Once this wa fixed and secured, all extra cement wa removed and attention wa directed to the femoral component.  The stemmed femoral component wa then impacted in position and cemented.  Again care wa ensured that it wa in adequate position and proper rotation.  A size 14 mm poly wa then inserted in between to provide compression.  This wa then taken through extension and held until cement cured.  This wa then removed and the component were evaluated.  All excess cement wa removed and they were well fixed.  Size 14 mm trial Poly wa then placed and this wa taken through range of motion.  This wa found to have excellent range of motion and good stability.  It wa elected at this time that we would go with the size 14 mm Poly.  This gave u extra Poly for ware and then provide excellent contact throughout the range of motion.  The final articular surface wa then placed and tightened into position to allow to _______ secured.  The knee wa then reduced and the knee wa taken through range of motion.  The patella wa tracking with no-touch technique and adequately positioned.  At this point, the tourniquet wa deflated for second time and then the knee wa copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  All bleeding wa cauterized using a Bovie cautery.  The retinaculum wa then repaired using #1 Ethibond in a figure-of-eight fashion.  This wa reinforced with a running #2-0 Vicryl.  The knee wa then flexed and noted that the patella wa tracking with good alignment.  The wound wa again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  A drain wa placed prior to retinaculum repair deep to this to provide adequate drainage.  At this point, the subcutaneous tissue wa closed with #2-0 Vicryl.  Skin wa approximated with skin clips.  Sterile dressing of Adaptic, 4x4, Webril, and ABDs were then placed.  A large Dupre dressing wa then placed up the entire lower extremity.

Xylocaine 2% with epinephrine wa injected beneath the conjunctiva and skin of the lower lid and also beneath the conjunctiva and skin of the upper lid.  A frontal nerve block wa also given on the right upper lid.  The anesthetic agent wa also injected in the right preauricular region which would provide a donor graft for the right lower lid defect.  The area wa marked with a marking pen with margin of 3 to 4 mm, and a #15 Bard-Parker blade wa used to make an incision at the nasal and temporal margin of the lesion.,The incision wa carried inferiorly, and using a Steven scissors the normal skin, muscle, and conjunctiva wa excised inferiorly.  The specimen wa then marked and sent to pathology for frozen section.  Bleeding wa controlled with a wet-field cautery, and the right upper lid wa everted, and an incision wa made 3 mm above the lid margin with the Bard-Parker blade in the entire length of the upper lid.  The incision reached the orbicularis, and Steven scissors were used to separate the tarsus from the underlying orbicularis.  Vertical cut were made nasally and temporally, and a large dorsal conjunctival flap wa fashioned with the conjunctiva attached superiorly.  It wa placed into the defect in the lower lid and sutured with multiple interrupted 6-0 Vicryl suture nasally, temporally, and inferiorly.,The defect in the skin wa measured and an appropriate large preauricular graft wa excised from the right preauricular region.  The defect wa closed with interrupted 5-0 Prolene sutures, and the preauricular graft wa sutured in place with multiple interrupted 6-0 silk sutures.  The upper border of the graft wa attached to the upper lid after incision wa made in the gray line with a Superblade, and the superior portion of the skin graft wa sutured to the upper lid through the anterior lamella created by the razor blade incision.,Cryotherapy wa then used to treat the nasal and temporal margin of the area of excision because of positive margins, and following this an antibiotic steroid ointment wa instilled and a light pressure dressing wa applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and wa sent to recovery room in good condition. ",2.0
4470,"REASON FOR VISIT: , Followup of laparoscopic fundoplication and gastrostomy.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a delightful baby girl, who is now nearly 8 month of age and had a tracheostomy for subglottic stenosis.  Laparoscopic fundoplication and gastrostomy wa done because of the need for enteral feeding access and to protect her airway at a time when it is either going to heal enough to improve and allow decannulation or eventually prove that she will need laryngotracheoplasty.  Dr. X is following The patient for this and currently plan are to perform a repeat endoscopic exam every couple of month to assist the status of her airway caliber.,The patient had a laparoscopic fundoplication and gastrostomy on 10/05/2007.  She ha done well since that time.  She ha had some episode of retching intermittently and these seemed to be unpredictable.  She also had some diarrhea and poor feeding tolerance about a week ago but that ha also resolved.  The patient currently take about 1 ounce to 1.5 ounce of her feeding by mouth and the rest is given by G-tube.  She seems otherwise happy and is not having an excessive amount of stools.  Her parent have not noted any significant problem with the gastrostomy site.,The patient's exam today is excellent.  Her belly is soft and nontender.  All of her laparoscopic trocar site are healing with a normal amount of induration, but there is no evidence of hernia or infection.  We removed The patient's gastrostomy button today and showed her parent how to reinsert one without difficulty.  The site of the gastrostomy is excellent.  There is not even a hint of granulation tissue or erythema, and I am very happy with the overall appearance.,IMPRESSION: , The patient is doing exceptionally well status post laparoscope fundoplication and gastrostomy.  Hopefully, the exquisite control of acid reflux by fundoplication will help her airway heal, and if she doe well, allow decannulation in the future.  If she doe require laryngotracheoplasty, the protection from acid reflux will be important to healing of that procedure a well.,PLAN:  ,The patient will follow up a needed for problem related to gastrostomy.  We will see her when she come in the hospital for endoscopic exam and possibly laryngotracheoplasty in the future. ",2.0

She wa diagnosed per MRI.  An MRI confirmed the clinical diagnosis of anterior cruciate ligament tear.  She state she ha had multiple episode of instability to the patellofemoral joint throughout the year with multiple dislocations.  She elected to proceed with surgery to repair the anterior cruciate ligament a well a possibly plicate the medial retinaculum to help prevent further dislocation of the patellofemoral joint.  All risk and benefit of surgery were discussed with her at length.  She wa in agreement with the treatment plan.,PROCEDURE:  ,On 09/11/03, she wa taken to the operating room at ABCD General Hospital.  She wa placed supine on the operating table.  General anesthetic wa applied by the Anesthesiology Department.  Tourniquet wa placed on the proximal thigh and it wa then placed in a knee holder.  She wa sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  An Esmarch wa used to exsanguinate the lower extremity.  Tourniquet wa inflated to 325 mmHg.  Longitudinal incision wa made just medial to the tibial tubercle.  The subcutaneous tissue wa carefully dissected.  Hemostasis wa controlled with electrocautery.  The tendon of gracilis and semitendinosus were identified and isolated, and then stripped off the musculotendinous junction.  They were taken on the back table.  The soft tissue debris wa removed from the tendons.  The end of the tendon were sewn together using #5 Tycron whip type sutures.  The tendon were measured on back table and found to be 8 mm a the most adequate size, they were then placed under tension on the back table.  Stab incision wa made in the inferolateral parapatellar region, through this camera wa placed in the knee.  The knee wa inflated with saline solution and operative picture were obtained.  The above finding were noted.  A second port site wa initiated in the inferomedial parapatellar region.  Through this, a probe wa placed.  Tear in the posterior horn medial meniscus wa identified.  It wa resected using a meniscal resector.  It wa then further contoured using arthroscopic shaver.  Attention wa then taken to the lateral compartment.  A partial meniscectomy wa performed using the resector and the shaver.  The posterior periphery of the lateral meniscus wa also noticed to be unstable.  A repair wa then performed using two fasting fixed meniscal repair suture to help anchor the meniscus around the popliteus tendon.  There wa noted to be excellent fixation.  The shaver wa then taken into the intrachondral notch.  First a partial chondroplasty wa performed on the patella to remove the loose articular debris a well a a partial synovectomy to the medial aspect of the patellar femoral joint.  Next, the remnant of the anterior cruciate ligament wa removed using the arthroscopic shaver and arthroplasty wa then performed on the medial aspect of the lateral femoral condyle.  Next, a tibial guide wa placed through the anterior medial portal.  A ___ pin wa then placed up through the anterior incision entering the tibial eminence just anterior to the posterior cruciate ligament.  This tibial tunnel wa then drilled using 8 mm cannulated drill.  Next, an over-the-top guide wa then placed at approximately the 11:30 position.  A ____ pin wa then placed into the femur and 8 mm drill wa then used to drill this femoral tunnel approximately 35 mm.  Next the U shape guide wa placed through tibial tunnel into the femur.  A pin wa then placed through the distal femur from lateral to medial, through the U-shaped guide a puller wire wa then passed through the distal femur.  It wa then pulled out through the tibial tunnel using the You-shaped guide.  The tendon wa then placed around the wire.  The wire wa pulled back up through the tibial into the femoral tunnel.  A 40 mm bioabsorbable pin wa then placed through the femoral tunnel securing the hamstring tendons.  Attention wa then pulled through the tibial tunnel.  The knee wa cycled approximately 20 times.  A 9 mm bioabsorbable screw wa then placed through the tibial tunnel fixating the distal aspect of the graft.  There wa noted definite fixation of the graft.  There wa no evidence of impingement either in full flexion or full extension.  The knee wa copiously irrigated and it wa then suctioned dry.  A longitudinal incision wa made just medial to the patellofemoral joint.  Soft tissue were carefully dissected and the medial retinaculum wa incised along with the incision.  Following this, a release of lateral retinaculum wa performed using a knife to further release the patellofemoral joint and allow further medial plication.  The medial retinaculum wa then plicated using #1 Ethibond suture and then oversewn with #0 Vicryl suture.  The subcuticular tissue were reapproximated with #2-0 Vicryl simple interrupted suture followed by a #4-0 PDS running subcuticular stitch.  She wa placed in a DonJoy knee immobilizer.  The tourniquet wa deflated.  It wa noted the lower extremity wa warm and pink with good capillary refill.  She wa transferred to the recovery room in apparent stable and satisfactory condition.  Prognosis for this patient is guarded.  She will be full weightbearing on the lower extremity using the knee immobilizer locked in extension.  She may remove her dressing two to three days, however, follow back in the office in 10 to 14 day for suture removal.  She will require one to two more physical therapy to help regain motion and strength to the lower extremity. ",2.0

Posterior spine segmental instrumentation from T3-L5, placement of morcellized autograft and allograft.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 500 mL.,FINDINGS: , The patient wa found to have a severe scoliosis.  This wa found to be moderately corrected.  Hardware wa found to be in good position on AP and lateral projection using fluoroscopy.,INDICATIONS: , The patient ha a history of severe neurogenic scoliosis.  He wa indicated for anterior and posterior spinal fusion to allow for correction of the curvature a well a prevention of further progression.  Risks and benefit were discussed at length with the family over many visits.  They wished to proceed.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient wa brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position.  General anesthesia wa induced without incident.  He wa given a weight-adjusted dose of antibiotics.  Appropriate line were then placed.  He had a neuromonitoring performed a well.,He wa then initially placed in the lateral decubitus position with his left side down and right side up.  An oblique incision wa then made over the flank overlying the 10th rib.  Underlying soft tissue were incised down at the skin incision.  The rib wa then identified and subperiosteal dissection wa performed.  The rib wa then removed and used for autograft placement later.,The underlying pleura wa then split longitudinally.  This allowed for entry into the pleural space.  The lung wa then packed superiorly with wet lap.  The diaphragm wa then identified and this wa split to allow for access to the thoracolumbar spine.,Once the spine wa achieved, subperiosteal dissection wa performed over the visualized vertebral bodies.  This required cauterization of the segmental vessels.  Once the subperiosteal dissection wa performed to the posterior and anterior extent possible, the diskectomies were performed.  These were performed from T11-L3.  This wa over 5 levels.  Disks and endplate were then removed.  Once this wa performed, morcellized rib autograft wa placed into the spaces.  The table had been previously bent to allow for easier access of the spine.  This wa then straightened to allow for compression and some correction of the curvature.,The diaphragm wa then repaired a wa the pleura overlying the thoracic cavity.  The rib were held together with #1 Vicryl sutures.  Muscle layer were then repaired using a running #2-0 PDS suture and the skin wa closed using running inverted #2-0 PDS suture a well.

The spine wa prepped and draped in a standard fashion.,Longitudinal incision wa made from T2-L5.  The underlying soft tissue were incised down at the skin incision.  Electrocautery wa then used to maintain hemostasis.  The spinous process were then identified and the overlying apophysis were split.  This allowed for subperiosteal dissection over the spinous processes, lamina, facet joints, and transverse processes.  Once this wa completed, the C-arm wa brought in, which allowed for easy placement of screw in the lumbar spine.  These were placed at L4 and L5.  The interspaces between the spinous process were then cleared of soft tissue and ligamentum flavum.  This wa done using a rongeur a well a a Kerrison rongeur.  Spinous process were then harvested for morcellized autograft.,Once all the interspaces were prepared, Songer wire were then passed.  These were placed from L3-T3.,Once the wire were placed, a unit rod wa then positioned.  This wa secured initially at the screw distally on both the left and right side.  The wire were then tightened in sequence from the superior extent to the inferior extent, first on the left-sided spine where I wa operating and then on the right side spine.  This allowed for excellent correction of the scoliotic curvature.,Decortication wa then performed and placement of a morcellized autograft and allograft wa then performed after thoroughly irrigating the wound with 4 liter of normal saline mixed with bacitracin.  This wa done using pulsed lavage.,The wound wa then closed in layers.  The deep fascia wa closed using running #1 PDS suture, subcutaneous tissue wa closed using running inverted #2-0 PDS suture, the skin wa closed using #4-0 Monocryl a needed.  The wound wa then dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform dry sterile dressings, and tape.  The patient wa awakened from anesthesia and taken to the intensive care unit in stable condition.

3467,"REASON FOR VISIT:  ,The patient is a 76-year-old man referred for neurological consultation by Dr. X.  The patient is companied to clinic today by his wife and daughter.  He provides a small portion of his history; however, his family provides virtually all of it.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , He ha trouble with walking and balance, with bladder control, and with thinking and memory.  When I asked him to provide me detail, he could not tell me much more than the fact that he ha trouble with his walking and that he ha trouble with his bladder.  He is vaguely aware that he ha trouble with his memory.,According to his family, he ha had difficulty with his gait for at least three or four years.  At first, they thought it wa weakness and because of he wa on the ground (for example, gardening) he wa not able to get up by himself.  They did try stopping the statin that he wa taking at that time, but because there wa no improvement over two weeks, they resumed the statin.  As time progressed, he developed more and more difficulty.  He started to shuffle.  He started using a cane about two and a half year ago and ha used a walker with wheel in the front since July of 2006.  At this point, he frequently if not always ha trouble getting in or out of the seat.  He frequently tends to lean backwards or sideways when sitting.  He frequently if not always ha trouble getting in or out a car, always shuffle or scuff his feet, always ha trouble turning or changing direction, always ha trouble with uneven surface or curbs, and always ha to hold on to someone or something when walking.  He ha not fallen in the last month.  He did fall earlier, but there seemed to be fewer opportunity for him to fall.  His family ha recently purchased a lightweight wheelchair to use if he is traveling long distances.  He ha no stair in his home, however, his family indicates that he would not be able to take stairs.  His handwriting ha become smaller and shakier.,In regard to the bladder, he states, ""I wet the bed.""  In talking with his family, it seems a if he ha no warning that he need to empty his bladder.  He wa diagnosed with a small bladder tumor in 2005.  This wa treated by Dr. Y.  Dr. X doe not think that the bladder tumor ha anything to do with the patient's urinary incontinence.  The patient ha worn a pad or undergarment for at least one to one and a half years.  His wife state that they go through two or three of them per day.  He ha been placed on medications; however, they have not helped.,He ha no headache or sensation of head fullness.,In regard to the thinking and memory, at first he seemed forgetful and had trouble with dates.  Now he seems le spontaneous and his family state he seems to have trouble expressing himself.  His wife took over his medication about two year ago.  She stopped his driving about three year ago.  She discovered that his license had been expired for about a year and she wa concerned enough at that time that she told him he could drive no more.  Apparently, he did not object.  At this point, he frequently ha trouble with memory, orientation, and everyday problem solving at home.  He need coaching for his daily activity such a reminder to brush his teeth, put on his clothes, and so forth.  He is a retired office machine repairman.  He is currently up and active about 12 hour a day and sleeping or lying down about 12 hour per day.,He ha not had PT or OT and ha not been treated with medication for Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease.  He ha been treated for the bladder.  He ha not had lumbar puncture.,Past medical history and review of all 14 system from the form they completed for this visit that I reviewed with them is negative with the exception that he ha had hypertension since 1985, hypercholesterolemia since 1997, and diabetes since 1998.  The bladder tumor wa discovered in 2005 and wa treated noninvasively.  He ha lost weight from about 200 pound to 180 pound over the last two or three years.  He had a period of depression in 1999 and wa on Prozac for a while, but this wa then stopped.  He used to drink a significant amount of alcohol.  This wa problematic enough that his wife wa concerned.  She state he stopped when she retired and she wa at home all day.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,He quit smoking in 1968.  His current weight is 183 pounds.  His tallest height is 5 foot 10 inches.,FAMILY HISTORY:  ,His grandfather had arthritis.  His father had Parkinson's disease.  His mother had heart disease and a sister ha diabetes.,He doe not have a Living Will and indicates he would wish his wife to make decision for him if he could not make them for himself.,REVIEW OF HYDROCEPHALUS RISK FACTORS: , None.,ALLERGIES: , None.,MEDICATIONS: , Metformin 500 mg three time a day, Lipitor 10 mg per day, lisinopril 20 mg per day, metoprolol 50 mg per day, Uroxatral 10 mg per day, Detrol LA 4 mg per day, and aspirin 81 mg per day.,PHYSICAL EXAM: , On examination today, this is a pleasant 76-year-old man who is guided back from the clinic waiting area walking with his walker.  He is well developed, well nourished, and kempt.,Vital Signs:  His weight is 180 pounds.,Head:  The head is normocephalic and atraumatic.  The head circumference is 59 cm, which is the ,75-90th percentile for an adult man whose height is 178 cm.,Spine:  The spine is straight and not tender.  I can easily palpate the spinous processes.  There is no scoliosis.,Skin:  No neurocutaneous stigmata.,Cardiovascular Examination:  No carotid or vertebral bruits.,Mental Status:  Assessed for orientation, recent and remote memory, attention span, concentration, language, and fund of knowledge.  The Mini-Mental State Exam score wa 17/30.  He did not know the year, season, or day of the week nor did he know the building or specialty or the floor.  There wa a tendency for perseveration during the evaluation.  He could not copy the diagram of intersecting pentagons.,Cranial Nerve Exam:  No evidence of papilledema.  The pupillary light reflex is intact a are extraocular movement without nystagmus, facial expression and sensation, hearing, head turning, tongue, and palate movement.,Motor Exam:  Normal bulk and strength, but the tone is marked by significant paratonia.  There is no atrophy, fasciculations, or drift.  There is tremulousness of the outstretched hands.,Sensory Exam:  Is difficult to interpret.

It show the ventricle are enlarged with a frontal horn span of 5.0 cm.  The 3rd ventricle contour is flat.  The span is enlarged at 12 mm.  The sylvian aqueduct is patent.  There is a pulsation artifact.  The corpus callosum is effaced.  There are extensive T2 signal abnormality that are confluent in the corona radiata.  There are also scattered T2 abnormality in the basal ganglia.  There is a suggestion of hippocampal atrophy.  There is also a suggestion of vermian atrophy.,ASSESSMENT: , The patient ha a clinical syndrome that raise the question of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus.  His examination today is notable for moderate-to-severe dementia and moderate-to-severe gait impairment.  His MRI scan raise the question of hydrocephalus, however, is also consistent with cerebral small vessel disease.,PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES:,1.  Possible idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (331.5).,2.  Probable cerebral small-vessel disease (290.40 & 438).,3.  Gait impairment (781.2).,4.  Urinary urgency and incontinence (788.33).,5.

She underwent an EGD and attempted colonoscopy; however, due to a very poor prep, only a flexible sigmoidoscopy wa performed at that time.  A coloscopy is now being performed for completion.,PROCEDURE:,  After proper informed consent wa obtained, the patient wa brought to the Endoscopy Suite.  She wa placed in the left lateral position and wa given sedation by the Anesthesia Department.  A digital rectal exam wa performed and there wa no evidence of mass.  The colonoscope wa then inserted into the rectum.  There wa some solid stool encountered.  The scope wa maneuvered around this.  There wa relatively poor prep a the scope wa advanced through the sigmoid colon and portion of the descending colon.  The scope wa then passed through the transverse colon and ascending colon to the cecum.  No mass or polyp were noted.  Visualization of the portion of the colon wa however somewhat limited.  There were scattered diverticuli noted in the sigmoid.,The scope wa slowly withdrawn carefully examining all walls.  Once in the rectum, the scope wa retroflexed and nonsurgical internal hemorrhoid were noted.  The scope wa then completely withdrawn.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and wa transferred to recovery room in stable condition.  She will be placed on a high-fiber diet and Colace and we will continue to monitor her hemoglobin.

Application of short-leg cast, right foot.,ANESTHESIA: , TIVA/local.,HISTORY:  ,This 31-year-old female present to ABCD Preoperative Holding Area after keeping herself n.p.o., since mid night for surgery on her painful right third plantar flex metatarsal.  In addition, she complains of a painful right talus bunion to the right foot.  She ha tried conservative method such a wide shoe and serial debridement and accommodative padding, all of which provided inadequate relief.  At this time she desire to attempt a surgical correction.  The risk versus benefit of the procedure have been explained to the patient by Dr. X and the consent is available on the chart for review.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,After IV wa established by the Department Of Anesthesia, the patient wa taken to the operating room via cart.  She wa placed on the operating table in supine position and a safety strap wa placed across her waist for retraction.  Next, copious amount of Webril were applied around the right ankle and a pneumatic ankle tourniquet wa applied.,Next, after adequate IV sedation wa administered by the Department Of Anesthesia, a total of 10 cc mixture of 4.5 cc of 1% lidocaine/4.5 cc of 0.5% Marcaine/1 cc of Kenalog wa injected into the right foot in an infiltrative type block.  Next, the foot wa prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion.  An Esmarch bandage wa used to exsanguinate the foot and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet wa elevated to 250 mmHg.  Next, the foot wa lowered in the operative field and attention wa directed to the dorsal third metatarsal area.  There wa a plantar hyperkeratotic lesion and a plantar flex palpable third metatarsal head.  A previous cicatrix wa noted with slight hypertrophic scarring.  Using a #10 blade, a lazy S-type incision wa created over the dorsal aspect of the third metatarsal, approximately 3.5 cm in length.  Two semi-elliptical converging incision were made over the hypertrophic scar and it wa removed and passed off a a specimen.  Next, the #15 blade wa used to deepen the incision down to the subcutaneous tissue.  Any small traversing vein were ligated with electrocautery.  Next, a combination of blunt and sharp dissection were used to undermine the long extensor tendon, which wa tacked down with a moderate amount of fibrosis and fibrotic scar tissue.  Next, the extensor tendon wa retracted laterally and the deep fascia over the metatarsal wa identified.  A linear incision down to bone wa made with a #15 blade to the capsuloperiosteal tissues.  Next, the capsuloperiosteal tissue were elevated using a sharp dissection with a #15 blade, off of the third metatarsal.  McGlamry elevator wa carefully inserted around the head of the metatarsal and freed and all the plantar adhesion were freed.  A moderate amount of plantar adhesion were encountered.  The third toe wa plantar flex and the third metatarsal wa delivered into the wound.  Next, a V-shaped osteotomy with an apex distally wa created using a sagittal saw.  The metatarsal head wa allowed to float.  The wound wa flushed with copious amount of sterile saline.  #3-0 Vicryl wa used to close the capsuloperiosteal tissues, which kept the metatarsal head contained.  Next, #4-0 Vicryl wa used to close the subcutaneous layer in a simple interrupted suture technique.  Next, #4-0 nylon wa used to close the skin in a simple interrupted technique.,Attention wa directed to the right fifth metatarsal.  There wa a large palpable hypertrophic prominence, which is the area of maximal pain, which the patient complained of preoperatively.  A #10 blade wa used to make a 3 cm incision through the skin.  Next, a #15 blade wa used to deepen the incision through the subcutaneous tissue.  Next, the medial and lateral aspect were undermined.  The abductor tendon wa identified and retracted.  A capsuloperiosteal incision wa made with a #15 blade in a linear fashion down to the bone.  The capsuloperiosteal tissue were elevated off the bone with a Freer elevator and a #15 blade.,Next, the sagittal saw wa used to resect the large hypertrophic dorsal exostosis.  A reciprocating rasp wa used to smooth all bony prominences.  The wound wa flushed with copious amount of sterile saline.  #3-0 Vicryl wa used to close the capsuloperiosteal tissues.  #4-0 Vicryl wa used to close subcutaneous layer with a simple interrupted suture.  Next, #4-0 nylon wa used to close the skin in a simple interrupted technique.  Next, attention wa directed to the plantar aspect of the third metatarsal where a bursal sac wa felt to be palpated under the plantar flex third metatarsal head.  A #15 blade wa used to make a small linear incision under the third metatarsal head.  The incision wa deepened through the dermal layer and curved hemostat and Metzenbaum scissors were used to undermine the skin from the underlying bursa.  The wound wa flushed and two simple interrupted suture with #4-0 nylon were applied.,Standard postoperative dressing wa applied consisting of Xeroform, 4x4s, Kerlix, Kling, and Coban.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet wa released and immediate hyperemic flush wa noted to the digits.,A sterile stockinet wa placed on the toe just below the knee.  Copious amount of Webril were placed on all bony prominences.  3 inch and 4 inch fiberglass cast tape wa used to create a below the knee well-padded, well-moulded cast.  One wa able to insert two finger to the distal and proximal aspect of the _cast.  The capillary refill time to the digit wa le than three second after cast application.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.  She wa transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital sign stable and vascular status intact to the right foot.  She wa given standard postoperative instruction to rest, ice and elevate her right foot.  She wa counseled on smoking cessation.  She wa given Vicoprofen #30 1 p.o. q.4-6h p.r.n., pain.  She wa given Keflex #30 1 p.o. t.i.d.  She is to follow up with Dr. X on Monday.  She is to be full weightbearing with a cast boot.  She wa given emergency contact number to call u if problem arises.

She wa prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for pelviolabdominal surgery.  Bimanual examination revealed a mid position normal-sized uterus with benign adnexal area.,In the high lithotomy position, a weighted speculum wa placed into the posterior vaginal wall.  The anterior lip of the cervix wa grasped with a single-tooth tenaculum.  A Hulka tenaculum wa placed transcervically.  The other instrument were removed.  A Foley catheter wa placed transurethrally to drain the bladder intraoperatively.,In the low lithotomy position and in steep Trendelenburg, attention wa turned to the infraumbilical region.  Here, a stab wound incision wa made through which the 120 mm Veress needle wa placed and approximately 3 L of carbon dioxide used to create a pneumoperitoneum.  The needle wa removed, the incision minimally enlarged, and the #5 trocar and cannula were placed.  The trocar wa removed and the scope placed confirming a preperitoneal insufflation.,The space wa drained off the insufflated gas and 2 more attempt were made, which failed due to the patient's adiposity.  Attention wa turned back to the vaginal area where in the high lithotomy position, attempt were made at a posterior vaginal apical insertion.  The Hulka tenaculum wa removed, the posterior lip of the cervix grasped with a single-tooth tenaculum, and the long Allis clamp used to grasp the posterior fornix on which wa placed traction.  The first short and subsequently 15 cm Veress needle were attempted to be placed, but after several passes, no good pneumoperitoneum could be established via this route also.  It wa elected not to do a transcervical intentional uterine perforation, but to return to the umbilical area.  The 15 cm Veress needle wa inserted several times, but again a pneumo wa preperitoneal.,Finally, an open laparoscopic approach wa undertaken.  The skin incision wa expanded with a knife blade.  Blunt dissection wa used to carry the dissection down to the fascia.  This wa grasped with Kocher clamps, entered sharply and opened transversely.  Four 0 Vicryl suture were placed a stay suture and tagged with hemostat and needle were cutoff.  Dissection continued between the rectus muscle and finally the anterior peritoneum wa reached, grasped, elevated, and entered.,At this juncture, the Hasson cannula wa placed and tied snugly with the above stay suture while the pneumoperitoneum wa being created, a #10 scope wa placed confirming the intraperitoneal positioning.,Under direct visualization, a suprapubic 5 mm cannula and manipulative probe were placed.  Clockwise inspection of the pelvis revealed a benign vesicouterine pouch, normal uterus and fundus, normal right tube and ovary.  In the cul-de-sac, there were 3 cluster of 3 to 5 carbon charred type endometrial implant and those more distally in the greatest depth had created puckering and tenting.  The left tube and ovary were normal.  There were no adhesions.  There wa no evidence of acute pelvic inflammatory disease.,The Endoshears and subsequently cautery on a hook were placed and the implant fulgurated.  Pictures were taken for confirmation both before and after the burn.,The carbon char were irrigated and aspirated.  The smoke plume wa removed without difficulty.  Approximately 50 mL of irrigant wa left in the pelvis.  Due to the difficulty in placing and maintaining the Hasson cannula, no attempt were made to view the upper abdominal quadrant, specifically the liver and gallbladder.,The suprapubic cannula wa removed under direct visualization, the pneumo released, the scope removed, the stay suture cut, and the Hasson cannula removed.  The residual suture were then tied together to completely occlude the fascial opening so that there will be no future hernia at this site.  Finally, the skin incision were approximated with 3-0 Dexon subcuticularly.  They had been preincisionally injected with bupivacaine to which the patient said she had no known allergies.  The vaginal instrument were removed.  All count were correct.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and wa taken to the recovery room in stable condition. ",2.0
1179,"REFERRING DIAGNOSIS: , Motor neuron disease.,PERTINENT HISTORY AND EXAMINATION:,  Briefly, the patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of progression of dysphagia for the past year, dysarthria, weakness of her right arm, cramp in her legs, and now with progressive weakness in her upper extremities.,SUMMARY:  ,The right median sensory response showed a borderline normal amplitude for age with mild slowing of conduction velocity.  The right ulnar sensory amplitude wa reduced with slowing of the conduction velocity.  The right radial sensory amplitude wa reduced with slowing of the conduction velocity.  The right sural and left sural sensory response were absent.  The right median motor response showed a prolonged distal latency across the wrist, with proximal slowing.  The distal amplitude wa very reduced, and there wa a reduction with proximal stimulation.  The right ulnar motor amplitude wa borderline normal, with slowing of the conduction velocity across the elbow.  The right common peroneal motor response showed a decreased amplitude when recorded from the EDB, with mild slowing of the proximal conduction velocity across the knee.  The right tibial motor response showed a reduced amplitude with prolongation of the distal latency.  The left common peroneal response recorded from the EDB showed a decreased amplitude with mild distal slowing.  The left tibial motor response showed a decreased amplitude with a borderline normal distal latency.  The minimum F-wave latency were normal with the exception of a mild prolongation of the ulnar F-wave latency, and the tibial F-wave latency a indicated above.  With repetitive nerve stimulation, there wa no significant decrement noted in either the right nasalis or the right trapezius muscles.  Concentric needle EMG study were performed in the right lower extremity, right upper extremity, thoracic paraspinals, and in the tongue.  There wa evidence of increased insertional activity in the right tibialis anterior muscle, with evidence of fasciculation noted in several lower and upper extremity muscle and in the tongue.  In addition, there wa evidence of increased amplitude, long duration and polyphasic motor unit with a decreased recruitment noted in most muscle tested a indicated in the table above.,INTERPRETATION: , Abnormal electrodiagnostic study.  There is electrodiagnostic evidence of a disorder of the anterior motor neuron affecting at least four segments.  There is also evidence of a more generalized neuropathy that seems to be present in both the upper and lower extremities.  There is also evidence of a right median mononeuropathy at the wrist and a right ulnar neuropathy at the elbow.  Even despite the patient's age, the decrease in sensory response is concerning, and make it difficult to be certain about the diagnosis of motor neuron disease.  However, the overall change on the needle EMG would be consistent with a diagnosis of motor neuron disease.  The patient will return for further evaluation. ",2.0

She ha had atrial fibrillation and previous episode of congestive heart failure.  She ha dyspnea on exertion and occasionally orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.,PROCEDURE:,  After the risks, benefits, and alternative of the above-mentioned procedure were explained to the patient in detail, informed consent wa obtained, both verbally and in writing.  The patient wa taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Lab where the procedure wa performed.  The right inguinal area wa thoroughly cleansed with Betadine solution and the patient wa draped in the usual manner.  1% lidocaine solution wa used to anesthetize the right inguinal area.  Once adequate anesthesia had been attained, a thing wall Argon needle wa used to cannulate the right femoral vein.  A guidewire wa advanced into the lumen of the vein without resistance.  The needle wa removed and the guidewire wa secured to the sterile field.  The needle wa flushed and then used to cannulate the right femoral artery.  A guidewire wa advanced through the lumen of the needle without resistance.  A small nick wa made in the skin and the needle wa removed.  This pressure wa held.  A #6 French arterial sheath wa advanced over the guidewire without resistance.  The dilator and guidewire were removed.  FiO2 sample wa obtained and the sheath wa flushed.  An #8 French sheath wa advanced over the guidewire into the femoral vein after which the dilator and guidewire were removed and the sheath wa flushed.  A Swan-Ganz catheter wa advanced through the venous sheath into a pulmonary capillary wa positioned and the balloon wa temporarily deflated.  An angulated pigtail catheter wa advanced into the left ventricle under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of a guidewire.  The guidewire wa removed.  The catheter wa connected to a manifold and flushed.  Left ventricular pressure were continuously measured and the balloon wa re-inflated and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure wa remeasured.  Using dual transducer together and the mitral valve radius wa estimated.  The balloon wa deflated and mixed venous sample wa obtained.  Hemodynamics were measured.  The catheter wa pulled back in to the pulmonary artery right ventricle and right atrium.  The right atrial sample wa obtained and wa negative for shunt.  The Swan-Ganz catheter wa then removed and a left ventriculogram wa performed in the RAO projection with a single power injection of non-ionic contrast material.  Pullback wa then performed which revealed a minimal LV-AO gradient.  Since the patient had aortic insufficiency on her echocardiogram, an aortogram wa performed in the LAO projection with a single power injection of non-ionic contrast material.  The pigtail catheter wa then removed and a Judkins left #4 catheter wa advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of a guidewire.  The guidewire wa removed.  The catheter wa connected to the manifold and flushed.  The ostium of the left main coronary artery wa carefully engaged.  Using multiple hand injection of non-ionic contrast material, the left coronary system wa evaluated in different views.  This catheter wa then removed and a Judkins right #4 catheter wa advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of a guidewire.  The guidewire wa removed.  The catheter wa connected to the manifold and flushed.  The ostium of the right coronary artery wa then engaged and using hand injection of non-ionic contrast material, the right coronary system wa evaluated in different views.  This catheter wa removed.  The sheath were flushed final time.  The patient wa taken to the Postcatheterization Holding Area in stable condition.,FINDINGS:,HEMODYNAMICS: , Right atrial pressure 9 mmHg, right ventricular pressure is 53/14 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressure 62/33 mmHg with a mean of 46 mmHg.  Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is 29 mmHg.  Left ventricular end diastolic pressure wa 13 mmHg both pre and post left ventriculogram.  Cardiac index wa 2.4 liter per minute/m2.

The right upper extremity wa then prepped and draped in the usual manner.  A sterile tourniquet wa placed on the proximal aspect of the right upper extremity.  The extremity wa then elevated and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage and tourniquet wa inflated to 250 mmHg.  Tourniquet time wa 74 minutes.  A curvilinear incision wa made in the antecubital fossa of the right elbow down through the skin.  Hemostasis wa achieved utilizing electrocautery.  Subcutaneous fat wa separated and the skin flap elevated.  The _________ wa identified.  It wa incised.  The finger wa placed approximately up the anterior aspect of the arm and the distal aspect of the biceps tendon wa found.  There wa some serosanguineous fluid from the previous rupture.  This area wa suctioned clean.  The biceps tendon end were then placed over a sterile tongue blade and were then sharply cut approximately 5 mm to 7 mm from the tip to create a fresh surface.  At this point, the #2 fiber wire wa then passed through the tendon.  Two fiber wire were utilized in a Krackow-type suture.  Once this wa completed, dissection wa taken digitally down into the antecubital fossa in the path where the biceps tendon had been previously.  The radial tuberosity wa palpated.  Just ulnar to this, a curved hemostat wa passed through the soft tissue and wa used to tent the skin on the radial aspect of the elbow.  A skin incision wa made over this area.  Approximately two inch down to the skin and subcutaneous tissues, the fascia wa split and the extensor muscle wa also split.,A stat wa then attached through the tip of that stat and passed back up through the antecubital fossa.  The tail of the fiber wire suture were grasped and pulled down through the second incision.  At this point, they were placed to the side.  Attention wa directed at exposure of the radial tuberosity with a forearm fully pronated.  The tuberosity came into view.  The margin were cleared with periosteal elevator and sharp dissection.  Utilizing the power bur, a trough approximately 1.5 cm wide x 7 mm to 8 mm high wa placed in the radial tuberosity.  Three small drill hole were then placed along the margin for passage of the suture.  The area wa then copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution.  A #4-0 pullout wire wa utilized to pas the suture through the drill holes, one on each outer hole and two in the center hole.  The elbow wa flexed and the tendon wa then pulled into the trough with the forearm supinated.  The suture wa tied over the bone islands.  Both wound were then copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution and suctioned dry.  Muscle fascia wa closed with running #2-0 Vicryl suture on the lateral incision followed by closure of the skin with interrupted #2-0 Vicryl and small staples.  The anterior incision wa approximated with interrupted #2-0 Vicryl for Subq. and then skin wa approximated with small staples.  Both wound were infiltrated with a total of 30 cc of 0.25% Marcaine solution for postop analgesia.  A bulky fluff dressing wa applied to the elbow, followed by application of a long-arm plaster splint maintaining the forearm in the supinated position.  Tourniquet wa inflated prior to application of the splint.  Circulatory status returned to the extremity immediately.  The patient wa awakened.  He wa rather boisterous during his awakening, but care wa taken to protect the right upper extremity.  He wa then transferred to the recovery room in apparent satisfactory condition. ",2.0

A Foley catheter wa placed for decompression, and his abdomen wa prepared and draped in a standard fashion.  A 0.25% Marcaine wa infiltrated in the soft tissue around his umbilicus and in the suprapubic and left lower quadrant location chosen for trocar insertion.  We conducted our surgical timeout and reiterated all of Carlos' unique and important identifying information and confirmed the diagnosis of appendicitis and planned laparoscopic appendectomy a the procedure.  A 1-cm vertical infraumbilical incision wa made and an open technique wa used to place a 12-mm Step trocar through the umbilical fascia.  CO2 wa insufflated to a pressure of 15 mmHg and then two additional 5-mm working port were placed in area that had been previously anesthetized.,There wa a lot of diffuse purulent debris and adhesion between the omentum and adjacent surface of the bowel and the parietal peritoneum.  After these were gently separated, we began to identify the appendix.  In the __________ due to the large amount of small bowel dilatation and distension, I used the hook cautery with the lowest intraperitoneal __________ profile to coagulate the mesoappendix.  The base of the appendix wa then ligated with 2-0 PDS Endoloops, and the appendix wa amputated and withdrawn through the umbilical port.  I spent the next 10 minute irrigating purulent fluid and debris from the peritoneal cavity using 2 L of sterile crystalloid solution and a suction power irrigation system.  When this wa complete, the CO2 wa released one final time and a much of the fluid wa drained from the peritoneal cavity a possible.  The umbilical fascia wa closed with figure-of-eight suture of 0 Monocryl and the skin incision were closed with subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Steri-Strips.  The patient tolerated the operation well.

Due to the peripheral nature of the tumor located in the mid to lower pole laterally, he ha elected to undergo a partial nephrectomy.  Potential complication include but are not limited to,,1.  Infection.,2.  Bleeding.,3.  Postoperative pain.,4.  Herniation from the incision.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  Epidural anesthesia wa administered in the holding area, after which the patient wa transferred into the operating room.  General endotracheal anesthesia wa administered, after which the patient wa positioned in the flank standard position.  A left flank incision wa made over the area of the twelfth rib.  The subcutaneous space wa opened by using the Bovie.  The rib were palpated clearly and the fascia overlying the intercostal space between the eleventh and twelfth rib wa opened by using the Bovie.  The fascial layer covering of the intercostal space wa opened completely until the retroperitoneum wa entered.  Once the retroperitoneum had been entered, the incision wa extended until the peritoneal envelope could be identified.  The peritoneum wa swept medially.  The Finochietto retractor wa then placed for exposure.  The kidney wa readily identified and wa mobilized from outside Gerota's fascia.  The ureter wa dissected out easily and wa separated with a vessel loop.  The superior aspect of the kidney wa mobilized from the superior attachment.  The pedicle of the left kidney wa completely dissected revealing the vein and the artery.  The artery wa a single artery and wa dissected easily by using a right-angle clamp.  A vessel loop wa placed around the renal artery.  The tumor could be easily palpated in the lateral lower pole to mid pole of the left kidney.  The Gerota's fascia overlying that portion of the kidney wa opened in the area circumferential to the tumor.  Once the renal capsule had been identified, the capsule wa scored using a Bovie about 0.5 cm lateral to the border of the tumor.  Bulldog clamp wa then placed on the renal artery.  The tumor wa then bluntly dissected off of the kidney with a thin rim of a normal renal cortex.  This wa performed by using the blunted end of the scalpel.  The tumor wa removed easily.  The argon beam coagulation device wa then utilized to coagulate the base of the resection.  The visible larger bleeding vessel were oversewn by using 4-0 Vicryl suture.  The edge of the kidney were then reapproximated by using 2-0 Vicryl suture with pledgets at the end of the suture to prevent the suture from pulling through.  Two horizontal mattress suture were placed and were tied down.  The Gerota's fascia wa then also closed by using 2-0 Vicryl suture.  The area of the kidney at the base wa covered with Surgicel prior to tying the sutures.  The bulldog clamp wa removed and perfect hemostasis wa evident.  There wa no evidence of violation into the calyceal system.  A 19-French Blake drain wa placed in the inferior aspect of the kidney exiting the left flank inferior to the incision.  The drain wa anchored by using silk sutures.  The flank fascial layer were closed in three separate layer in the more medial aspect.  The lateral posterior aspect wa closed in two separate layer using Vicryl sutures.  The skin wa finally reapproximated by using metallic clips.  The patient tolerated the procedure well. ",2.0

Her history is also significant for likely recurrent aspiration pneumonia and intubation earlier on this admission a well.  Previously while treating this patient I had met with the family and discussed how aggressive the patient would wish her level of care to be given that there wa evidence of possible ovarian malignancy with elevated CA-125 and a complex mass located in the ovary.  As the patient wa showing sign of improvement with some speech and ability to follow commands, decision wa made to continue to pursue an aggressive level of care, treat her dysphagia, hypertension, debilitation and this wa being done.  However, last night the patient had apparently catastrophic event around 2:40 in the morning.  Rapid response wa called and the patient wa intubated, started on pressure support, and given CPR.  This morning I wa called to the bedside by nursing stating the family had wished at this point not to continue this aggressive level of care.  The patient wa seen and examined, she wa intubated and sedated.  Limbs were cool.  Cardiovascular exam revealed tachycardia.  Lungs had coarse breath sounds.  Abdomen wa soft.  Extremities were cool to the touch.  Pupils were 6 to 2 mm, doll's eye were not intact.  They were not responsive to light.  Based on discussion with all family member involved including both sons, daughter and daughter-in-law, a decision wa made to proceed with terminal wean and comfort care measures.  All pressure support wa discontinued.  The patient wa started on intravenous morphine and respiratory wa requested to remove the ET tube.  Monitors were turned off and the patient wa made a comfortable a possible.  Family is at the bedside at this time.  The patient appears comfortable and the family is in agreement that this would be her wish per my understanding of the family and the patient dynamic over the past month, this is a very reasonable and appropriate approach given the patient's failure to turn around after over a month of aggressive treatment with likely terminal illness from ovarian cancer and associated comorbidities.,Total time spent at the bedside today in critical care services, medical decision making and explaining option to the family and proceeding with terminal weaning wa excess of 37 minutes.

Because of the length of the prostate, a pull-back wa performed, pulling row #2 approximately 3 mm and row #3, #4 and #5 approximately 1 cm back before refreezing.,OPERATION IN DETAIL: , The patient wa brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  After adequate general endotracheal anesthesia wa obtained, the patient wa positioned in the dorsal lithotomy position.  Full bowel prep had been obtained prior to the procedure.  After performing flexible cystoscopy, a Foley catheter wa placed per urethra into the bladder.  Next, the ultrasound probe wa placed into the stabilizer and advanced into the rectum.  An excellent ultrasound image wa visualized of the entire prostate, which wa re-measured.  Next, the probe template wa positioned over the perineum and the template guide brought up on the ultrasound screen in order to guide needle placement.  Then 17-gauge needle were serially placed into the prostate, from an anterior to posterior direction into the prostate.  Ultrasound guidance demonstrated that these needles, numbering approximately 14 to 15 needles, were well placed and spaced throughout the prostate to obtain excellent freezing of the entire gland while sparing the urethra.  Repeat cystoscopy demonstrated a single needle passing through the urethra; and due to the high anterior location of this needle, it wa removed.  The CMS urethral warmer wa then passed per urethra into the bladder, and flow instituted.  After placing these 17-gauge needles, the prostate wa then frozen down to minus 150 degree for 10 minute in sequential fashion from anterior to posterior.  The ice ball wa monitored and wa seen to extend through the capsule of the prostate toward the rectum but not through the rectal wall itself.  Active warming wa then performed before refreezing the prostate again and then passively warming it back to room temperature.

2872,"REASON FOR VISIT: , The patient is an 84-year-old man who return for revaluation of possible idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus.  He is accompanied by his wife and daughter.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  I first saw him nearly a year ago on December 20, 2007.  At that time, he had had a traumatic deterioration over the course of approximately eight months.  This included severe cognitive impairment, gait impairment, and incontinence.  He had actually been evaluated at Hospital with CSF drainage via a temporary spinal catheter, but there wa no response that wa noted.  When I saw him, there were finding consistent with cervical stenosis and I ordered an MRI scan of the cervical spine.  I subsequently referred him to Dr. X, who performed a cervical laminectomy and instrumented fusion on July 16, 2008.  According to his note this went well.,According to the family, there ha not been any improvement.,With regard to the gait and balance, they actually think that he is worse now than he wa a year ago.  He is virtually unable to walk at all.  He need both a walker and support from an assistant to be able to stand or walk.  Therefore, he is always in the wheelchair.,He is completely incontinent.  He never indicates his need to the go to the bathroom.  On the other hand when asked, he will indicate that he need to go.  He wear a Depends undergarment all the time.,He ha no headaches.,His thinking and memory are worse.  For the most part, he is apathetic.  He doe not talk very much.  He life in a skilled nursing facility in the Alzheimer's section.  He doe have some daytime activities.  He take a nap once a day.  He doe not read very much.  On the other hand, he did recently exercise the right to vote in the presidential election.  He need full assistance at the nursing home.,MEDICATIONS:,  From the list by the nursing home are Aricept 10 mg in the evening, carbidopa/levodopa 25/100 mg three time a day, citalopram (Celexa) 40 mg daily, Colace 100 mg twice a day, finasteride (Proscar) 5 mg once a day, Flomax (tamsulosin) 0.4 mg once a day, multivitamin with iron once a day, omeprazole (Prilosec) 20 mg once a day, senna 8.6 mg twice a day, Tylenol 650 mg a needed, and promethazine 25 mg a needed.,PHYSICAL EXAM: , On examination today, this is a pleasant 81-year-old man who is brought back from the clinic waiting area in a wheelchair.  He is well developed, well nourished, and kempt.,Vital Signs:  Temperature 96.7, pulse 62, respiration 16, and blood pressure 123/71.,Head:  The head is normocephalic and atraumatic.,Mental Status:  Assessed for orientation, recent and remote memory, attention span, concentration, language, and fund of knowledge.  The Mini-Mental State Exam score wa 14/30.  He wa not at all oriented.  He did know we were at Sinai Hospital on the second floor.  He could spell 'world' forward, but wa mute when asked to spell backwards.  He wa mute when asked to recall 3/3 object for delayed recall.  He could not copy a diagram of intersecting pentagons.  For comparison, the Mini-Mental State exam score last December wa 20/30 when attention wa tested by having him spell 'world' backwards and 28/30 when tested with serial 7 subtractions.  Additionally, there are time when he stutter or stammers.  I do not see any paraphasic errors.  There is some evidence of ideomotor apraxia.  He is also stimulus bound.  There is a tendency to mimic.,Cranial Nerve Exam:  There is no upgaze that I can elicit today.  The horizontal gaze and down gaze are intact.  This is a change from a year ago.  The muscle of facial expiration are intact a are hearing, head turning, cough, tongue, and palate movement.,Motor Exam:  Normal bulk and strength.  The tone is characterized by paratonia.  There is no atrophy, fasciculations, drift, or tremor.,Sensory Exam:  Intact to light touch.,Cerebellar Exam:  Intact for finger-to-nose testing that he can perform only by mimicking, but not by following verbal commands.,Gait:  Severely impaired.  When in the wheelchair, he lean to one side.  He cannot getup on his own.  He need assistance.  Once up, he can bear weight, but cannot maintain his balance.  This would amount to a Tinetti score of zero.,REVIEW OF X-RAYS: , I personally reviewed the CT scan of the brain from November 1, 2008 and compared it to the MRI scan from a year ago.  The ventricle appear larger to me now in comparison to a year ago.  The frontal horn span is now 6 cm, whereas previously it wa about 5.5 cm.  The 3rd ventricular span is about 15 mm.  There is no obvious atrophy, although there may be some subtle bilateral perisylvian atrophy.  The scan from a year ago showed that there wa a patent sylvian aqueduct.,ASSESSMENT:,  The patient ha had worsening of his gait, his dementia, and his incontinence.  The new finding for me today is the limited upgaze.  This would be consistent either with progressive supranuclear palsy, which wa one of the differential diagnosis a year ago, or it could be consistent with progressive enlargement of the ventricles.,PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES:,1.  Question of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (331.5).,2.  Possible supranuclear palsy.,3.  Severe gait impairment.,4.  Urinary urgency and incontinence.,5.  Dementia.,PLAN: , I had a long talk with him and his family.  Even though he ha already had a trial of CSF drainage via spinal catheter at Hospital over a year ago, I offered this test to them again.  I do so on the basis that there is further enlargement of the ventricle on the scan.  His family and I discussed the fact that it is not likely to be only hydrocephalus.  Instead we are trying to answer the question of whether hydrocephalus is contributing sufficiently to his symptom that progressing with shunt surgery would make a difference.  I have advised them to think it over for a day and contact my office to see whether they would wish to proceed.  I gave them a printed prescription of the protocol including it rationale, risks, benefits, and alternatives.  I specifically mentioned the 3% chance of infection, which mean a 97% chance of no infection. ",1.0

The aortic root wa normal in size.,ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS:,1.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  It is unknown if this is a new onset versus a paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  Given the patient ha a recurrent stroke, anticoagulation with Coumadin to prevent further stroke is indicated.  However, given the patient's current neurologic status, the safety of falling is unclear.  We need to further discus with the patient's primary care physician, probably rehab physician.  If the patient's risk of falling is low, then Coumadin is indicated.  However, if the patient's risk for falling is high, then a course using aspirin and Plavix will be recommended.  Transesophageal echocardiogram probably will delineate possible intracardiac thrombus better, however will not change our current management.  Therefore, I will not recommend transesophageal echocardiogram at this point.  Currently, the patient's heart rate is well controlled, antiarrhythmic agent is not recommended at this point.,2.  Carotid artery stenosis.  The patient underwent a carotid Doppler ultrasound on this admission and found to have a high-grade increased velocity of the right internal carotid artery.  It is difficult to ass the severity of the stenosis given the history of possible right carotid stenting.  If clinically indicated, CT angio of the carotid will be indicated to ass for stent patency.  However, given the patient's current acute stroke, revascularization is not indicated at this time.,3.

No white cell and 0-2 red cells.,Chest x-ray suboptimal in quality, but without obvious infiltrates, consolidation or pneumothorax.,CRITICAL CARE NOTE:,  Critical care one hour.,Shortly after the patient’s initial assessment, the patient apparently began to complain of chest pain and appeared to the nurse to have mounting exhaustion and respiratory distress. Although O2 had been placed, elevating his oxygen saturation to the mid to upper 90s, he continued to complain of symptoms, a noted above. He became progressively more rapidly obtunded. The patient did receive one gram of magnesium sulfate shortly after his arrival, and the BiPAP apparatus wa being readied for his use. However, the patient, at this point, became unresponsive, unable to answer questions, and preparation were begun for intubation. The BiPAP apparatus wa briefly placed while supply and medication were assembled for intubation. It wa noted that even with the BiPAP apparatus, in the duration of time which wa required for transfer of oxygen tubing to the BiPAP mask, the patient’s O2 saturation rapidly dropped to the upper 60 range.,All preparation for intubation having been undertaken, Succinylcholine wa ordered, but wa apparently unavailable in the department. As the patient wa quite obtunded, and while the Dacuronium wa being sought, an initial trial of intubation wa carried out using a straight blade and a cupped 7.9 endotracheal tube. However, the patient had enough residual muscle tension to make this impractical and further effort were held pending administration of Dacuronium 10 mg. After approximately two minutes, another attempt at intubation wa successful. The cord were noted to be covered with purulent exudate at the time of intubation.,The endotracheal tube, having been placed atraumatically, the patient wa initially then nebulated on 100% oxygen, and his O2 saturation rapidly rose to the 90-100% range.,Chest x-ray demonstrated proper placement of the tube. The patient wa given 1 mg of Versed, with decrease of his pulse from the 140-180 range to the 120 range, with satisfactory maintenance of his blood pressure.,Because of a complaint of chest pain, which I myself did not hear, during the patient’s initial triage elevation, a trial of Tridil wa begun. As the patient’s pressure held in the slightly elevated range, it wa possible to push this to 30 mcg per minute. However, after administration of the Dacuronium and Versed, the patient’s blood pressure fell somewhat, and this medication wa discontinued when the systolic pressure briefly reached 98.,Because of concern regarding pneumonia or sepsis, the patient received one gram of Rocephin intravenously shortly after the intubation. A nasogastric and Foley were placed, and an arterial blood gas wa drawn by respiratory therapy. Dr. X wa contacted at this point regarding further order a the patient wa transferred to the Intensive Care Unit to be placed on the ventilator there. The doctor’s call wa transferred to the Intensive Care Unit so he could leave appropriate order for the patient in addition to my initial orders, which included Albuterol or Atrovent q. 2h. and Levaquin 500 mg IV, a well a Solu-Medrol.,Critical care note terminates at this time.,EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:,  See the critical care note.,MEDICAL DECISION MAKING (DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS):,  This patient ha an acute severe decompensation with respiratory failure. Given the patient’s white count and recent history of pneumonia, the possibility of recurrence of pneumonia is certainly there. Similarly, it would be difficult to rule out sepsis. Myocardial infarction cannot be excluded.,COORDINATION OF CARE:,  Dr. X wa contacted from the emergency room and asked to assume the patient’s care in the Intensive Care Unit.,FINAL DIAGNOSIS:,  Respiratory failure secondary to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:, The patient is to be transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for further management.

3916,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 55-year-old gentleman who present for further evaluation of right leg weakness.  He ha difficulty recollecting the exact detail and chronology of his problem.  To the best of his recollection, he think that about six month ago he developed weakness of his right leg.  He describes that he is reaching to get something from a cabinet and he noticed that he wa unable to stand on his right toe.  Since that time, he ha had difficulty pushing off when he walks.  He ha mild tingling and numbness in his toes, but this ha been a chronic problem and nothing new since he ha developed the weakness.  He ha chronic mild back pain, but this ha been persistent for many year and ha not changed.  He ha experienced cramp in both calf for the past year.  This dissipated about two month ago.  He doe not think that his left leg is weak.  He doe not have any bowel or bladder incontinence.  There is no radicular pain.  He doe not think that the problem is progressive, meaning that the weakness that he perceives in his right leg is no different than when it wa six month ago.,He first sought medical attention for this problem in October.  He then saw you a couple of month later.  He ha undergone an EMG and nerve conduction studies.  Unfortunately, he cannot undergo an MRI of his spine because he ha an ear implant.  He ha had a CT scan that show degenerative changes, but nothing obviously abnormal.,In addition, the patient ha hyperCKemia.  He tell me that he ha had an elevated CK prior to starting taking stat medications, although this is not entirely clear to me.  He think that he is not taking Lipitor for about 15 month and thought that his CK wa in the 500 or 600s prior to starting it.  Once it wa started, it increased to about 800 and then came down to about 500 when it wa stopped.  He then had a recent bump again up to the 1000 and since Lipitor ha been stopped, his CK apparently ha returned to about the 500 or 600s.  I do no have any laboratory data to support these statement by the patient, but he seems to be up to speed on this.  More recently, he ha been started taking Zetia.  He doe not have any proximal weakness.  He denies any myalgias., ,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  He ha coronary artery disease and ha received five stents.  He ha hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.  He state that he wa diagnosed with diabetes based on the result of an abnormal oral glucose tolerance test.  He belief that his glucose shot up to over 300 with this testing.  He doe not take any medication for this and his blood glucose are generally normal when he check it.  He ha had plastic surgery on his face from an orbital injury.  He also had an ear graft when he developed an ear infection during his honeymoon., ,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:, He take amlodipine, Diovan, Zetia, hydrochlorothiazide, Lovaza (fish oil), Niaspan, aspirin, and Chantix.  , ,ALLERGIES:,  He ha no known drug allergies., ,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  He life with his wife.

His father died of heart disease in his 40s.  He ha two living brothers.  One of them he doe not speak too much with and doe not know about his medical history.  The other is apparently healthy.  He ha one healthy child.  His maternal uncle apparently had polio.  When I asked him to tell me further detail about this, he state that one of them had to wear crutch due to severe leg deformans and then the other had leg deformity in only one leg.  He is fairly certain that they had polio.  He is unaware of any other family member with neurological conditions.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , He ha occasional tinnitus.  He ha difficulty sleeping.

She had severe dyspareunia and chronic suprapelvic pain.  The patient had had a prior left salpingoophorectomy laparoscopically in 2004 for same disease process.  Now, she presented with a recurrent right ovarian endometrioma and severe pelvic pain.  She desired surgical treatment.  She accepted risk of a complete hysterectomy and salpingoophorectomy, risk of injury to underlying organs.  The risks, benefits, and alternative were clearly discussed with the patient a documented in the medical record.,DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS: , Absent left adnexa.  Right ovary about 6 cm with chocolate cyst and severely adherent to the right pelvic side wall, uterus, and colon.  Careful dissection to free right ovary and remove it although it is likely that some ovarian tissue remains behind.  Ureter visualized and palpated on right and appears normal.  Indigo carmine given IV with no leak intraperitoneally noted.  Sigmoid colon dissected free from back of uterus and from cul-de-sac.  Bowel free of laceration or denudation.  Upon inspection, right tube with hydrosalpinx, appendix absent.  Omental adhesion to ensure abdominal wall wa lysed.,TECHNICAL PROCEDURE: , After informed consent wa obtained, the patient wa taken to the operating room where she underwent smooth induction of general anesthesia.  She wa placed in a supine position with a transurethral Foley in place and compression stocking in place.  The abdomen and vagina were thoroughly prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.,A Pfannenstiel skin incision wa made with the scalpel and carried down sharply to the underlying layer of fascia and peritoneum.  The peritoneum wa bluntly entered and the incision extended caudally and cephaladly with good visualization of underlying organs.  Next, exploration of the abdominal and pelvic organ revealed the above noted findings.  The uterus wa enlarged and probably contained adenomyosis.  There were dense adhesions, and a large right endometrioma with a chocolate cyst-like material contained within.  The sigmoid colon wa densely adhered to the cul-de-sac into the posterior aspect of the uterus.  A Bookwalter retractor wa placed into the incision, and the bowel wa packed away with moist laparotomy sponges.  Next, a sharp and blunt dissection wa used to free the extensive adhesions, and enterolysis wa performed with very careful attention not to injure or denude the bowel.  Next, the left round ligament and cornual region wa divided, transected, and suture-ligated with 0 Polysorb.  The anterior and posterior leaf of the broad ligament were dissected and opened anteriorly to the level of the bladder.  The uterine artery were skeletonized on the left, and these were suture-clamped and transected with 0 Polysorb with good hemostasis noted.  Next, the bladder flap wa developed anteriorly, and the bladder peritoneum wa sharply and bluntly dissected off of the lower uterus.,On the right, a similar procedure wa performed.  The right round ligament wa suture-ligated with 0 Polysorb.  It wa transected and divided with electrocautery.  The anterior and posterior leaf of the broad ligament were dissected and developed anteriorly and posteriorly, and this area wa relatively avascular.  The left infundibulopelvic ligament wa identified.  It wa cross-clamped and transected, suture-ligated with 0 Polysorb with good hemostasis noted.  Next, the uterine artery were skeletonized on the right.  They were transected and suture-ligated with 0 Polysorb.  The uterosacral ligament were taken bilaterally and transected and suture-ligated with 0 Polysorb.  The cardinal ligament were taken near their insertion into the cervical and uterine tissue.  Pedicles were sharply developed and suture-ligated with 0 Polysorb.  Next, the electrocautery wa used to dissect the cervix anteriorly from the underlying vagina.  Once entry into the vagina wa made, the cervix and uterus were amputated with Jorgensen scissors.  The vaginal cuff angle were suture-ligated with 0 Polysorb and transfixed to the ipsilateral, cardinal, and uterosacral ligament for vaginal support.  The remainder of the vagina wa closed with figure-of-eight suture in an interrupted fashion with good hemostasis noted.,Next, the right ovarian tissue wa densely adherent to the colon.  It wa sharply and bluntly dissected, and most of the right ovary and endometrioma wa removed and dissected off completely; however, there is a quite possibility that small remnant of ovarian tissue were left behind.  The right ureter wa seen and palpated.  It did not appear to be dilated and had good peristalsis noted.  Next, the retractor were removed.  The laparotomy sponge were removed from the abdomen.  The rectus fascia wa closed with 0 Polysorb in a continuous running fashion with 2 suture meeting in the midline.  The subcutaneous tissue wa closed with 0 plain gut in an interrupted fashion.  The skin wa closed with 4-0 Polysorb in a subcuticular fashion.  A thin layer of Dermabond wa placed.,The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle count were correct x 2.

Stripping of multiple left lower extremity varicose veins.,ANESTHESIA:,  General endotracheal.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Approximately 150 mL.,SPECIMENS: , Multiple veins.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,BRIEF HISTORY:,  This is a 30-year-old Caucasian male who presented for elective evaluation from Dr. X's office for evaluation of intractable pain from the left lower extremity.  The patient ha had painful varicose vein for number of years.  He ha failed conservative measure and ha felt more aggressive treatment to alleviate his pain secondary to his varicose veins.  It wa recommended that the patient undergo a saphenous vein ligation and stripping.  He wa explained the risks, benefits, and complication of the procedure including intractable pain.  He gave informed consent to proceed.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS:,  The left greater saphenous vein femoral junction wa identified and multiple tributary were ligated surrounding this region.,The vein wa stripped from the saphenofemoral junction to the level of the knee.  Multiple tributary of the greater saphenous vein and varicose vein from the left lower extremity were ligated and stripped accordingly.  Additionally, there were noted to be multiple region within these vein that were friable and edematous consistent with acute and chronic inflammatory change making stripping of these varicose vein extremely difficult.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient wa marked preoperatively in the Preanesthesia Care Unit.  The patient wa brought to the operating suite, placed in the supine position.  The patient underwent general endotracheal intubation.  After adequate anesthesia wa obtained, the left lower extremity wa prepped and draped circumferentially from the foot all the way to the distal section of the left lower quadrant and just right of midline.  A diagonal incision wa created in the direction of the inguinal crease on the left.  A self-retaining retractor wa placed and the incision wa carried down through the subcutaneous tissue until the greater saphenous vein wa identified.  The vein wa isolated with a right angle.  The vein wa followed proximally until a multiple tributary branch were identified.  These were ligated with #3-0 silk suture.  The dissection wa then carried to the femorosaphenous vein junction.  This wa identified and #0 silk suture wa placed proximally and distally and ligated in between.  The proximal suture wa tied down.  Distal suture wa retracted and a vein stripping device wa placed within the greater saphenous vein.  An incision wa created at the level of the knee.  The distal segment of the greater saphenous vein wa identified and the left foot wa encircled with #0 silk suture and tied proximally and then ligated.  The distal end of the vein stripping device wa then passed through at it most proximal location.  The device wa attached to the vein stripping section and the greater saphenous vein wa then stripped free from it canal within the left lower extremity.  Next, attention wa made towards the multiple tributary of the varicose vein within the left lower leg.  Multiple incision were created with a #15 blade scalpel.  The incision were carried down with electrocautery.  Next, utilizing sharp dissection with a hemostat, the tissue wa spread until the vein wa identified.  The vein wa then followed to T3 and in all these location intersecting segment of varicose vein were identified and removed.  Additionally, some segment were removed.  The stripping approach would be vein stripping device.  Multiple branch of the saphenous vein were then ligated and/or removed.  Occasionally, dissection wa unable to be performed a the vein wa too friable and would tear from the hemostat.  Bleeding wa controlled with direct pressure.  All incision were then closed with interrupted #3-0 Vicryl suture and/or #4-0 Vicryl sutures.,The femoral incision wa closed with interrupted multiple #3-0 Vicryl suture and closed with a running #4-0 subcuticular suture.  The leg wa then cleaned, dried, and then Steri-Strips were placed over the incisions.  The leg wa then wrapped with a sterile Kerlix.  Once the Kerlix wa achieved, an Ace wrap wa placed over the left lower extremity for compression.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and wa transferred to Postanesthesia Care Unit extubated in stable condition.  He will undergo evaluation postoperatively and will be seen shortly in the postanesthesia care unit. ",2.0

In addition, the extraoral area on the left neck wa prepped with Betadine and draped accordingly.  Gauze throat pack wa placed and local anesthetic wa administered in the left lower quadrant, total of 3.4 mL of lidocaine 2% with 1:100,000 epinephrine and Marcaine 1.7 mL of 0.5% with 1:200,000 epinephrine.  An incision wa made with #15 blade in the left submandibular area through the skin and blunt dissection wa accomplished with curved mosquito hemostat to the inferior border of the mandible.  No purulent drainage wa obtained.  The 0.25 inch Penrose drain wa then placed in the extraoral incision and it wa secured with 3-0 silk suture.  Moving to the intraoral area, periosteal elevator wa used to elevate the periosteum from the buccal aspect of tooth #19.  The area did not drain any purulent material.  The carious tooth #19 wa then extracted by elevator and forceps extraction.  After the tooth wa removed, the 0.25 inch Penrose drain wa placed in a subperiosteal fashion adjacent to the extraction site and secured with 3-0 silk suture.  The tube wa then repositioned to the left side allowing access to the upper right quadrant where tooth #2 wa then extracted by routine elevator and forceps extraction.  After the extraction, the throat pack wa removed.  An orogastric tube wa then placed by Dr. X, and stomach content were suctioned.  The pharynx wa then suctioned with the Yankauer suction.  The patient wa awakened, extubated, and taken to the PACU in stable condition. ",2.0

He fell at some point near the onset of the symptoms, but belief that his symptom had occurred first. He fell from three to five foot and landed on his back. He began seeing a chiropractor approximately five day ago and had adjustment of the neck and lumbar spine, although he clearly had symptom prior to this.,He ha had mid and low back pain intermittently. He took a 10-day course of Cipro believing that he had a UTI. He denies, however, any bowel or bladder problems. There is no incontinence and he doe not feel that he is having any difficulty voiding.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:, He ha a history of surgery on the left kidney, when it wa ""rebuilt."" He ha had knee surgery, appendectomy and right inguinal hernia repair.,MEDICATIONS:, His only home medication had been Cipro and Aleve.

He is employed in sales, which requires quite a bit of walking, but he is not doing any lifting. He had been a golfer in the past.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:, He ha had documented cervical spondylosis, apparently with an evaluation over 15 year ago.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure 156/101, pulse wa 88, respiration 18. He is afebrile.,MENTAL STATUS: He is alert.,CRANIAL NERVES: His pupil were reactive to light. He had a dense left cataract present. The right disk margin appears sharp. His eye movement were full. The face wa symmetric. Pain and temperature sensation were intact over both side of the face. The tongue wa midline.,NECK: His neck wa supple.,MUSCULOSKELETAL: He ha intact strength and normal tone in the upper extremities. He had increased tone in both lower extremities. He had hip flexion of 4/5 on the left. He had intact strength on the right lower extremity, although had slight hammertoe deformity bilaterally.,NEUROLOGIC: His reflex were 2+ in the upper extremities, 3+ at the knee and 1+ at the ankles. He withdrew to plantar stimulation on the left, but did not have a Babinski response clearly present. He had intact finger-to-nose testing. Marked impairment in heel-to-shin testing. He wa able to sit unassisted. He stood with assistance, but had a markedly ataxic gait.

2414,"HISTORY:  ,The patient is a 76-year-old male, with previous history of dysphagia, status post stroke.  The patient stated that he wa at Hospital, secondary to his stroke, where he had his initial modified barium swallow study.  The patient stated that the result of that modified revealed aspiration with thin liquid only.  He is currently eating and drinking without difficulty and he feel that he can return to a regular diet with thin liquids.  A modified barium swallow study wa ordered to objectively evaluate the patient's swallowing function and safety and to rule out aspiration.,STUDY: , Modified barium swallow study wa performed in the radiology suite in cooperation with Dr. X. The patient wa seated upright and in a video-imaging chair throughout this assessment.,To evaluate the patient's swallowing function and safety, he wa administered graduated amount of liquid and food mixed with barium in the form of thin liquid (teaspoon x3, cup sip x3); nectar-thick liquid (teaspoon x2, cup sip x3); pureed consistency (teaspoon x3); solid consistency (1/4 cracker x1).,FINDINGS,ORAL STAGE: , The patient had no spillage out lips.  Oral residual after swallow with increased viscosity requiring multiple swallow to clear oral cavity.,The patient ha reduced lingual retraction contributing to vallecula pooling after the swallow.  Trace premature spillage wa noted with thin liquid during this assessment.,PHARYNGEAL STAGE: , Aspiration noted on cup sip of thin liquid.  Trace-to-mild penetration with teaspoon amount of thin liquid during and after the swallow.  The penetration after the swallow occurred secondary to spillage on the piriform sinus into the laryngeal vestibule.  The patient ha incomplete laryngeal closure, which allowed the aspiration and penetration with thin liquids.  The patient had no aspiration or penetration occur with nectar-thick liquid, puree, and solid food.  The patient ha a mildly reduced hyolaryngeal elevation and anterior movement that lead to incomplete epiglottic inversion that contributes to vallecula pooling.  Mild-to-moderate pooling in the vallecula after the swallow with liquid and puree, this residual did decrease with the solid feed presentation.  The patient ha mild residual of pooling in the piriform sinus after a swallow that did clear with sequential swallows.,CERVICAL ESOPHAGEAL STAGE: , The patient's upper esophageal sphincter opening is well coordinated with swallow and readily accepted the bolus.,DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: , Mild aspiration with cup sip of thin liquid, penetration during and after the swallow with teaspoon amount of thin liquid.  No aspiration or penetration occurred with thick liquid, pureed, or solid food during this assessment.,PROGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: , With a modified diet, the patient's potential for swallowing safety is good.,PLAN:,Based on this evaluation, the following is recommended:,1.  The patient should be on a regular diet with nectar-thick liquid to help prevent aspiration and penetration.,2.  The patient should have unthickened water in between meal to help decrease his risk of dehydration.,3.  The patient should complete good oral care two time a day to decrease bacterial growth in mouth.,4.  The patient should be seated at a 90-degree angle when eating and drinking, a well a take small bite and small sip to help decrease risk of aspiration and penetration and reflux.,Thank you for the opportunity to evaluate the patient.  I look forward to working with him in the outpatient setting to improve his swallowing function and safety.  Outpatient skilled speech therapy is recommended for a trial of neuromuscular electrical stimulation therapy for muscle re-education, a well a to train patient to use swallowing technique and maneuver that should improve his swallowing function and safety.

The patient wa admitted to the hospital with suspicion of endocarditis given the fact that she had fever, septicemia, and Osler node on her fingers.  The patient had a transthoracic echocardiogram a an outpatient, which wa equivocal, but a transesophageal echocardiogram here in the hospital wa normal with no evidence of vegetations.  The microbiology laboratory stated that the Gram-negative rod appeared to be anaerobic, thus raising the possibility of organism like bacteroides.  The patient doe have a history of congenital genitourinary abnormality which were surgically corrected before the fifth grade.  We did a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, which only showed some benign appearing cyst in the liver.  There wa nothing remarkable a far a her kidneys, ureters, or bladder were concerned.  I spoke with Dr. XYZ of infectious diseases, and Dr. XYZ asked me to talk to the patient about any contact with animals, given the fact that we have had a recent outbreak of tularemia here in Utah.  Much to my surprise, the patient told me that she had multiple pet rat at home, which she wa constantly in contact with.  I ordered tularemia and leptospirosis serology on the advice of Dr. XYZ, and a of the day after discharge, the result of the microbiology still are not back yet.  The patient, however, appeared to be responding well to levofloxacin.  I gave her a 2-week course of 750 mg a day of levofloxacin, and I have instructed her to follow up with Dr. XYZ in the meantime.  Hopefully by then we will have a final identification and susceptibility on the organism and the tularemia and leptospirosis serology will return.  A thought of ours wa to add doxycycline, but again the patient clinically appeared to be responding to the levofloxacin.  In addition, I told the patient that it would be my recommendation to get rid of the rats.  I told her that if indeed the rat were carrier of infection and she received a zoonotic infection from exposure to the rats, that she could be in ongoing continuing danger and her child could also potentially be exposed to a potentially lethal infection.  I told her very clearly that she should, indeed, get rid of the animals.

Following completion of the discectomy and osteophytectomy, a blunt nerve hook wa passed into the canal superiorly and inferiorly a well a in the both neural foramen to make sure that there were no extruded disc fragment and to make sure the bony decompression wa complete.  A portion of the uncovertebral joint wa resected bilaterally for additional nerve root decompression.  Both nerve root were visualized and noted to be free of encroachment.  The same procedure wa then carried out at C6-C7 with similar findings.  The only difference in the finding wa that at C6-C7 on the left side, the patient wa found to have an extruded disc fragment in the canal and extending into the left side neural foramen causing significant cord and nerve root encroachment.,In preparation for the arthrodesis, the endplate of C5, C6, and C7 were burred in a parallel fashion down to the level of bleeding bone using a high-speed cutting bur with irrigant solution for cooling.  The disc space were then measured to the nearest millimeter.  Attention wa then turned toward preparation of the structural allograft, which consisted of two piece of pre-machined corticocancellous bone.  The graft were further shaped to fit the disc space exactly in a press-fit manner with approximately 1.5 mm of distraction at each disc space.  The graft were shaped to be slightly lordotic to help preserve the cervical lordosis.  The graft were impacted into the disc spaces.  There wa complete bony apposition between the end of the bone graft and the vertebral body of C5, C6, and C7.  A blunt nerve hook wa passed posterior to each bone graft to make sure that the bone graft were in good position.  Anterior osteophyte were removed using a high-speed cutting bur with irrigant solution for cooling.  An appropriate length Synthes cervical plate wa selected and bent slightly to conform to the patient's cervical lordosis.  The plate wa held in the midline with provided instrumentation while a temporary fixation screw wa applied at C6.  Screw hole were then drilled using the provided drill and drill guide taking care to avoid injury to neurovascular structures.  The plate wa then rigidly fixed to the anterior spine using 14-mm cancellous screw followed by locking setscrew added to the head of each screw to prevent postoperative loosening of the plate and/or screws.,An x-ray wa taken, which confirmed satisfactory postioning of the plate, screws, and bone grafts.,Blood loss wa minimal.  The wound wa irrigated with irrigant solution containing antibiotics.  The wound wa inspected and judged to be dry.  The wound wa closed over a suction drain placed in the deepest portion of the wound by reapproximating the platysma muscle with #4-0 Vicryl running suture, the subdermal and subcuticular layer with #4-0 Monocryl interrupted sutures, and the skin with Steri-Strips.  The sponge and needle count were correct.  A sterile dressing wa applied to the wound.  The neck wa placed in a cervical orthosis.  The patient tolerated the procedure and wa transferred to the recovery room in stable condition. ",2.0

She sustained a right open ankle fracture, right femur fracture, right femoral neck fracture, right open knee, and right elbow abrasions.  Given the emergent nature of the right femoral neck fracture and her young age a well a the open fracture, it wa decided to proceed with an urgent operative intervention.  The risk of surgery were discussed in detail and the consent were signed.  The operative site wa marked.  The patient wa taken to the operating room where she wa given preoperative clindamycin.  The patient had then general anesthetic performed by anesthesia.,A well-padded side tourniquet wa placed.  Attention wa turned to the right ankle first.  The large medical laceration wa extended and the tissue were debrided.  All dirty of the all injured bone, muscle, and tissue were debrided.  Wound wa then copiously irrigated with 8 liter of normal saline.  At this point, the medial malleolus fracture wa identified and wa reduced.  This wa then fixed in with two 4.5 mm cannulated Synthes screws.,Next, the attention wa turned to lateral malleolus.  Incision wa made over the distal fibula.  It wa carried down sharply through the skin in the subcutaneous issues.  Care wa taken to preserve the superficial peroneal nerve.  The fracture wa identified, and there wa noted to be very comminuted distal fibula fracture.  The fracture wa reduced and confirmed with fluoroscopy.  A 7 hole Synthes 3.5 mm locking plate wa placed.  This wa placed in a bridging fashion with three screw above and three screw below the fracture.  Appropriate reduction wa confirmed under fluoroscopy.  A cotton test wa performed, and the ankle did not open up.  Therefore, it wa decided not to proceed with syndesmotic screw.,Next, the patient wa then placed in the fracture table and all extremity were well padded.  All prominence were padded.  The right leg wa then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  A 2-cm incision wa made just distal to the greater trochanter.  This wa carried down sharply through the skin to the fascia.  The femur wa identified.  The guidewire for a striker Asnis 6.5 mm screw wa placed in the appropriate position.  The triangle guide wa then used to ensure appropriate triangular formation of the remainder of the screws.  A reduction of the fracture wa performed prior to placing all the guide wires.  A single 8 mm Asnis screw wa placed inferiorly followed by two 6.5 mm screw superiorly.,Next, the abrasion on the right elbow were copiously irrigated.  The necrotic and dead tissue wa removed.  The abrasion did not appear to enter the joints.  They were wrapped with Xeroform 4 x 4 x 4 Kerlix and Ace wrap.,Next, the laceration of the anterior knee were connected and were extended in the midline.  They were carried down sharply to the skin and the retinacular issue to the joint.  The intercondylar notch wa identified.  A guide wire for the striker T2 retrograde nail wa placed and localized with fluoroscopy.  The opening reamer wa used following the bolted guide wire wa then passed.  The femur wa then sequentially reamed using the flexible reamers.  A T2 retrograde nail 10 x 340 wa then passed.  Two 5 mm distal locking screw and two 5 mm proximal locking screw were then placed.,Prior to reaming and passing the retrograde nail, the knee wa copiously irrigated with 8 liter of normal saline.  Any dead tissue in the knee were identified and were debrided using rongeurs and curettes.,The patient wa placed in the AO splint for the right ankle.

We discussed with the patient the indications, risks, benefits, alternatives, and complication of the proposed surgical procedure, she had her question asked and answered.  Preoperative imaging wa performed in consultation with regard to aesthetic result and communicated via the computerized imager.  The patient had question asked and answered.  Informed consent wa obtained.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient wa taken to the operating room and placed in supine position.  The appropriate level of general endotracheal anesthesia wa induced.  The patient wa converted to the lounge chair position, and the nose wa anesthetized and vasoconstricted in the usual fashion.  Procedure began with an inverted going incision and elevation of the skin of the nose in the submucoperichondrial plane over the medial crural footplate and lower lateral cartilage and up over the dorsum.  The septal angle wa approached and submucoperichondrial flap were elevated.  Severe nasal septal deviation to the right hand side and evidence of an old fracture with a separate alignment of the cartilaginous nose from the bony nose wa encountered.  The upper lateral were divided and medial and lateral osteotomy were carried out.  Inadequate septal cartilage wa noted to be present for use a spreader graft; therefore, left postauricular incision wa made, and the conchal bowl cartilage graft wa harvested, and it wa closed with 3-0 running locking chromic with a sterile cotton ball pressure dressing applied.  Ear cartilage graft wa then placed to put two spreader graft on the left and one the right.  The two on the left extended all the way up to the caudal tip, the one on the right just primarily the medial wall.  It wa placed in such a way to correct a caudal dorsal deviation of the nasal tip septum.  The upper lateral cartilage wa noted to be of the same width and length in size.  Yet, the left lower cartilage wa scarred and adherent to the upper lateral cartilage.  The upper lateral cartilage were noted to be excessive of uneven length with the right being much taller than the left and that wa shortened to the same length.  The scar band were released in the lower lateral cartilage to the upper lateral cartilage to allow free mobilization of the lower lateral cartilages.  A middle crus stitch wa used to unite the domes, and then the nose wa projected by suturing the medial crural footplate of the caudal septum in deep projected fashion.  Crushed ear cartilage wa then placed in the pocket above the spreader graft in the area of the deficient dorsal nasal height and the lateral nasal sidewall height.  The spreader brought an excellent aesthetic appearance to the nose.  We left more than 1 cm of dorsal and caudal support for the nasal tip and dorsum height.  Mucoperichondrial flap were closed with 4-0 plain gut suture.  The skin wa closed with 5-0 chromic and 6-0 fast absorbing gut.  Doyle splint were placed on each side of nasal septum and secured with 3-0 nylon and a Denver splint wa applied.  The patient wa awakened in the operating room and taken to the recovery room in good condition. ",2.0

The occipital area wa shaven bilaterally and then the area of the prior scalp incision were infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine after routine prepping and draping.  Both U-shaped scalp incision were opened exposing both the left and the right ventricular catheter a well a the old low pressure reservoir, which might have been leading to the coaptation of the ventricles.  The patient also had a right subtemporal depression, which wa full preoperatively.  The entire old apparatus wa dissected out.  We then cut both the ventricular catheter and secured them with suture so that __________ could be inserted.  They were both inspected.  No definite debris were seen.  After removing the ventricular catheters, the old tract were inspected and we could see where there wa coaptation of the ventricle against the ventricular catheter.  On the right side, we elected to insert the Portnoy ventricular catheter and on the left a new Bactiseal catheter wa inserted underneath the corpus callosum in a different location.  The old valve wa dissected out and the proGAV valve with a 2-0 shunt assist wa inserted and secured with a 2-0 Ethibond suture.  The proGAV valve wa then connected to a Bactiseal distal tubing, which wa looped in a cephalad way and then curved towards the left burr hole site and then the Portnoy catheter on the right wa secured with a right-angled sleeve and then interposed between it and the left burr hole site with a flushing reservoir.  All connection secured with 2-0 Ethibond suture and a small piece of Bactiseal tubing between the flushing reservoir and the connector, which secured the left Bactiseal tubing to the two other Bactiseal tubing one being the distal Bactiseal tubing going towards the proGAV valve, which wa set to an opening pressure of 8 and the other one being the Bactiseal tubing, which wa going towards the flushing reservoir.,All the wound were irrigated out with bacitracin and then closed in a routine manner using Vicryl for the deep layer and Monocryl for the skin, followed by Mastisol and Steri-Strips.

4630,"PREPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS:,  Left leg claudication.,POSTPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: ,  Left leg claudication.,OPERATION PERFORMED: , Aortogram with bilateral, segmental lower extremity run off.,ANESTHESIA: , Conscious sedation.,INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE:  ,The patient present with lower extremity claudication.  She is a 68-year-old woman, who is very fearful of the aforementioned procedures.  Risks and benefit of the procedure were explained to her to include bleeding, infection, arterial trauma requiring surgery, access issue and recurrence.  She appears to understand and agrees to proceed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient wa taken to the Angio Suite, placed in a supine position.  After adequate conscious sedation, both groin were prepped with Chloraseptic prep.  Cloth towel and paper drape were placed.  Local anesthesia wa administered in the common femoral artery and using ultrasound guidance, the common femoral artery wa accessed.  Guidewire wa threaded followed by a ,4-French sheath.  Through the 4-French sheath a 4-French Omni flush catheter wa placed.  The glidewire wa removed and contrast administered to identify the level of the renal artery.  Using power injector an aortogram proceeded.,The catheter wa then pulled down to the aortic bifurcation.  A timed run-off view of both leg wa performed and due to a very abnormal and delayed run-off in the left, I opted to perform an angiogram of the left lower extremity with an isolated approach.  The catheter wa pulled down to the aortic bifurcation and using a glidewire, I obtained access to the contralateral left external iliac artery.  The Omni flush catheter wa advanced to the left distal external iliac artery.  The glidewire rather exchanged for an Amplatz stiff wire.  This wa left in place and the 4-French sheath removed and replaced with a 6-French destination 45-cm sheath.  This wa advanced into the proximal superficial femoral artery and an angiogram performed.  I identified a functionally occluded distal superficial femoral artery and after obtaining view of the run off made plan for angioplasty.,The patient wa given 5000 unit of heparin and this wa allowed to circulate.  A glidewire wa carefully advanced using Roadmapping technique through the functionally occluded blood vessels.  A 4-mm x 4-cm angioplasty balloon wa used to dilate the area in question.,Final view after dilatation revealed a dissection.  A search for a 5-mm stent wa performed, but none of this wa available.  For this reason, I used a 6-mm x 80-mm marked stent and placed this at the distal superficial femoral artery.  Post dilatation wa performed with a 4-mm angioplasty balloon.  Further view of the left lower extremity showed irregular change in the popliteal artery.  No significant stenosis could be identified in the left popliteal artery and noninvasive scan.  For this reason, I chose not to treat any further area in the left leg.,I then performed closure of the right femoral artery with a 6-French Angio-Seal device.  Attention wa turned to the left femoral artery and local anesthesia administered.  Access wa obtained with the ultrasound and the femoral artery identified.  Guidewire wa threaded followed by a 4-French sheath.  This wa immediately exchanged for the 6-French destination sheath after the glidewire wa used to access the distal external iliac artery.  The glidewire wa exchanged for the Amplatz stiff wire to place the destination sheath.  The destination wa placed in the proximal superficial femoral artery and angiogram obtained.  Initial view had been obtained from the right femoral sheath before removal.,Views of the right superficial femoral artery demonstrated significant stenosis with accelerated velocity in the popliteal and superficial femoral artery.  For this reason, I performed the angioplasty of the superficial femoral artery using the 4-mm balloon.  A minimal dissection plane measuring le than 1 cm wa identified at the proximal area of dilatation.  No further significant abnormality wa identified.  To avoid placing a stent in the small vessel I left it alone and approached the popliteal artery.  A 3-mm balloon wa chosen to dilate a 50 to 79% popliteal artery stenosis.  Reasonable use were obtained and possibly a 4-mm balloon could have been used.  However, due to her propensity for dissection I opted not to.  I then exchanged the glidewire for an O1 for Thruway guidewire using an exchange length.  This wa placed into the left posterior tibial artery.  A 2-mm balloon wa used to dilate the orifice of the posterior tibial artery.  I then moved the wire to the perineal artery and dilated the proximal aspect of this vessel.  Final image showed improved run-off to the right calf.  The destination sheath wa pulled back into the left external iliac artery and an Angio-Seal deployed.,FINDINGS: , Aortogram demonstrates a dual right renal artery with the inferior renal artery supplying the lower one third of the right renal parenchyma.  No evidence of renal artery stenosis is noted bilaterally.  There is a single left renal artery.  The infrarenal aorta, both common iliac and the external iliac artery are normal.  On the right, a superficial femoral artery is widely patent and normal proximally.  At the distal third of the thigh there is diffuse disease with moderate stenosis noted.  Moderate stenosis is also noted in the popliteal artery and single vessel run-off through the posterior tibial artery is noted.  The perineal artery is functionally occluded at the midcalf.  The dorsal pedal artery filled by collateral at the high ankle level.,On the left, the proximal superficial femoral artery is patent.  Again, at the distal third of the thigh, there is a functional occlusion of the superficial femoral artery with poor collateralization to the high popliteal artery.  This wa successfully treated with angioplasty and a stent placement.  The popliteal artery is diffusely diseased without focal stenosis.  The tibioperoneal trunk is patent and the anterior tibial artery occluded at it orifice.,IMPRESSION,1.  Normal bilateral renal artery with a small accessory right renal artery.,2.  Normal infrarenal aorta a well a normal bilateral common and external iliac arteries.,3.  The proximal right renal artery is normal with moderately severe stenosis in the superficial femoral popliteal and tibial arteries.

Apgars 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minute respectively.  Weight pending at this time.  His name is Kasson a well a umbilical cord and placenta stained yellow.  Otherwise normal appearing uterus and bilateral tube and ovaries.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:,  After informed consent wa obtained, the patient wa taken to the operating room where spinal anesthesia wa obtained by Dr. X without difficulties.  The patient wa placed in supine position with leftward tilt.  Fetal heart tone were checked and were 140s, and she wa prepped and draped in a normal sterile fashion.  At this time, a Pfannenstiel skin incision made with a scalpel and carried down to the underlying fascia with electrocautery.  The fascia wa nicked sharply in the midline.  The fascial incision wa extended laterally with Mayo scissors.  The inferior aspect of the fascial incision wa grasped with Kocher x2, elevated, and rectus muscle dissected sharply with the use of Mayo scissors.  Attention wa then turned to the superior aspect of the fascial incision.  Fascia wa grasped, elevated, and rectus muscle dissected off sharply.  The rectus muscle were separated in the midline bluntly.  The peritoneum wa identified, grasped, and entered sharply and the peritoneal incision extended inferiorly and superiorly with good visualization of bladder.  Bladder blade wa inserted.  Vesicouterine peritoneum wa tented up and a bladder flap wa created using Metzenbaum scissors.  Bladder blade wa reinserted to effectively protect the bladder from the operative field and the lower uterine segment incised in a transverse U-shaped fashion with the scalpel.  Uterine incision wa extended laterally and manually.  Membranes were ruptured and bright yellow clear amniotic fluid wa noted.  Infant's head wa in a floating position, able to flex the head, push against the incision, and then easily brought it to the field vertex.  Nares and mouth were suctioned with bulb suction.  Remainder of the infant wa delivered atraumatically.  The infant wa very pale upon delivery.  Cord wa doubly clamped and cut and immediately handed to the awaiting intensive care nursery team.  An 8 cm segment of the tube wa doubly clamped and transected.  Cord gas were obtained.  Cord wa then cleansed, laid on a clean laparotomy sponge, and cord blood wa drawn for hematocrit measurements.  At this time, it wa noted that the cord wa significantly yellow stained a well a the placenta.  At this time, the placenta wa delivered via gentle traction on the cord and exterior uterine massage.  Uterus wa exteriorized and cleared off all clot and debris with dry laparotomy sponge and the lower uterine segment wa closed with 1-0 chromic in a running locked fashion.  Two area of oozing were noted and separate figure-of-eight suture were placed to obtain hemostasis.  At this time, the uterine incision wa hemostatic.  The bladder wa examined and found to be well below the level of the incision repair.  Tubes and ovary were examined and found to be normal.  The patient wa again asked if she desire permanent sterilization of which she agrees and therefore the right fallopian tube wa identified and followed out to the fimbriated end and grasped at the mid portion with a Babcock clamp.  Mesosalpinx wa divided with electrocautery and a 4-cm segment of tube wa doubly tied and transected with a 3-cm segment of tube removed.  Hemostasis wa noted.  Then, attention wa turned to the left fallopian tube which in similar fashion wa grasped and brought out through the fimbriated end and grasped the midline portion with Babcock clamp.  Mesosalpinx wa incised and 3-4 cm tube doubly tied, transected, and excised and excellent hemostasis wa noted.  Attention wa returned to the uterine incision which is seemed to be hemostatic and uterus wa returned to the abdomen.  Gutters were cleared off all clot and debris.  Lower uterine segment were again re-inspected and found to be hemostatic.  Sites of tubal sterilization were also visualized and were hemostatic.  At this time, the peritoneum wa grasped with Kelly clamp x3 and closed with running 3-0 Vicryl suture.  Copious irrigation wa used.  Rectus muscle belly wa examined and found to be hemostatic and tacked and well approximated in the midline.  At this time, the fascia wa closed using 0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  Manual palpation confirms thorough and adequate closure of the fascial layer.  Copious irrigation wa again used.  Hemostasis noted, and skin wa closed with staples.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, needle, and instrument count were correct x3 and the patient wa sent to the recovery room awake and stable condition.  Infant assumed the care of the intensive care nursery team and being followed and workup up for isoimmunization and fetal anemia.  The patient will be followed for her severe right upper quadrant pain post delivery.  If she continues to have pain, may need a surgical consult for gallbladder and/or angiogram for evaluation of right kidney and questionable venous plexus.

The patient received 3 nebulizer at home without much improvement.  He wa subsequently treated successfully with supplemental oxygen provided by normal nasal cannula initially and subsequently changed to BiPAP.,HOSPITAL COURSE:  ,The patient wa admitted to the hospitalist service, treated with frequent small volume nebulizers, treated with IV Solu-Medrol and BiPAP support for COPD exacerbation.  The patient also noted with poorly controlled atrial fibrillation with a rate in the low 100 to mid 100s.  The patient subsequently received diltiazem, also received p.o. digoxin.  The patient subsequently responded well a well received IV antibiotic including Levaquin and Zosyn.  The patient made slow, but steady improvement over the course of his hospitalization.  The patient subsequently wa able to be weaned off BiPAP during the day, but continued BiPAP at night and will continue with BiPAP if needed.  The patient may require a sleep study after discharge, but by the third day prior to discharge he wa no longer utilizing BiPAP, wa simply using supplemental O2 at night and wa able to maintain appropriate and satisfactory O2 saturation on one-liter per minute supplemental O2 per nasal cannula.  The patient wa able to participate with physical therapy, able to ambulate from his bed to the bathroom, and wa able to tolerate a dysphagia 2 diet.  Note that speech therapy did provide a consultation during this hospitalization and his modified barium swallow wa thought to be unremarkable and really related only to the patient's severe shortness of breath during meal time.  The patient's chest x-ray on admission revealed some mild vascular congestion and bilateral pleural effusion that appeared to be unchanged.  There wa also more pronounced patchy alveolar opacity, which appeared to be, ""mass like"" in the right suprahilar region.  This subsequently resolved and the patient's infiltrate slowly improved over the course of his hospitalization.  On the day prior to discharge, the patient had a chest x-ray 2 views, which allowing for difference in technique revealed little change in the bibasilar infiltrates and atelectatic change at the base bilaterally.  This wa compared with an examination performed 3 day prior.  The patient also had minimal bilateral effusions.  The patient will continue with clindamycin for the next 2 week after discharge.

3987,"REASON FOR NEUROLOGICAL CONSULTATION: , Cervical spondylosis and kyphotic deformity.  The patient wa seen in conjunction with medical resident Dr. X. I personally obtained the history, performed examination, and generated the impression and plan.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: ,The patient is a 45-year-old African-American female whose symptom first started some one and a half year ago with pain in the left shoulder and some neck pain.  This ha subsequently resolved.  She started vigorous workout in November 2005.  In March of this year, she suddenly could not feel her right foot on the bathroom floor and subsequently went to her primary care physician.  By her report, she had a nerve conduction study and a diagnosis of radiculopathy wa made.  She had an MRI of lumbosacral spine, which wa within normal limits.  She then developed a tingling sensation in the right middle toe.  Symptoms progressed to sensory symptom of her knees, elbows, and left middle toe.  She then started getting sensory sensation in the left hand and arm.  She state that she feel a little bit wobbly at the knee and that she is slightly dragging her left leg.  Symptoms have been mildly progressive.  She is unaware of any trigger other than the vigorous workout a mentioned above.  She ha no associated bowel or bladder symptoms.  No particular position relief her symptoms.,Workup ha included two MRIs of the C-spine, which were personally reviewed and are discussed below.  She saw you for consultation and the possibility of surgical decompression wa raised.  At this time, she is somewhat reluctant to go through any surgical procedure.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,1.  Ocular migraines.,2.  Myomectomy.,3.  Infertility.,4.  Hyperglycemia.,5.  Asthma.,6.  Hypercholesterolemia.,MEDICATIONS: , Lipitor, Pulmicort, Allegra, Xopenex, Patanol, Duac topical gel, Loprox cream, and Rhinocort.,ALLERGIES: , Penicillin and aspirin.,Family history, social history, and review of system are discussed above a well a documented in the new patient information sheet.  Of note, she doe not drink or smoke.  She is married with two adopted children.  She is a paralegal specialist.  She used to exercise vigorously, but of late ha been advised to stop exercising and is currently only walking.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , She doe complain of mild blurred vision, but these have occurred before and seem associated with headaches.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , On examination, blood pressure 138/82, pulse 90, respiratory rate 14, and weight 176.5 pounds.  Pain scale is 0.  A full general and neurological examination wa personally performed and is documented on the chart.  Of note, she ha a normal general examination.  Neurological examination reveals normal cognition and cranial nerve examination including normal jaw jerk.  She ha mild postural tremor in both arms.  She ha mild decreased sensation in the right palm and mild decreased light touch in the right palm and decreased vibration sense in both distal lower extremities.  Motor examination reveals no weakness to individual muscle testing, but on gait she doe have a very subtle left hemiparesis.  She ha hyperreflexia in her lower extremities, worse on the left.  Babinski's are downgoing.,PERTINENT DATA:  ,MRI of the brain from 05/02/06 and MRI of the C-spine from 05/02/06 and 07/25/06 were personally reviewed.  MRI of the brain is broadly within normal limits.  MRI of the C-spine reveals large central disc herniation at C6-C7 with evidence of mild cord compression and abnormal signal in the cord suggesting cord edema.  There is also a fairly large disc at C3-C4 with cord deformity and partial effacement of the subarachnoid space.  I do not appreciate any cord edema at this level.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  ,The patient is a 45-year-old female with cervical spondylosis with a large C6-C7 herniated disc with mild cord compression and signal change at that level.  She ha a small disc at C3-C4 with le severe and only subtle cord compression.  History and examination are consistent with sign of a myelopathy.,Results were discussed with the patient and her mother.  I am concerned about progressive symptoms.  Although she only ha subtle symptom now, we made her aware that with progression of this process, she may have paralysis.  If she is involved in any type of trauma to the neck such a motor vehicle accident, she could have an acute paralysis.  I strongly recommended to her and her mother that she followup with you a soon a possible for surgical evaluation.  I agree with the previous physician who have told her not to exercise a I am sure that her vigorous workout and weight training since November 2005 have contributed to this problem.  I have recommended that she wear a hard collar while driving.  The result of my consultation were discussed with you telephonically. ",2.0

He wa worked by the neurologist, Dr. X, and found to have cervical spondylosis with myelopathy.  I wa consulted and elected to do a lumbar and cervical myelogram CT scan, which showed lumbar stenosis but also cervical stenosis with more pathology anteriorly than posteriorly.  The patient had worst disease at level C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6.  The patient wa significantly weak and almost quadriparetic, stronger on the right side than on the left side.  I thought that surgery wa indicated to prevent progressive neurological deterioration, a well a to prevent a central cord syndrome if the patient were to get into a motor vehicle accident or simply fall.  Conservative management wa not an option.  The patient wa preoped and consented, and wa medically cleared.  I discussed the indications, risks, and benefit of the surgery with the patient and the patient's family.  The risk of bleeding, hoarseness, swallowing difficulty, pseudoarthrosis a well a plate migration and hardware failure were all discussed with the patient.  An informed consent wa obtained from the patient a such.  He wa brought into the OR today for the operative procedure.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient wa brought into the OR, intubated, and given a general anesthetic.  Intubation wa done under C-spine precautions.  The patient received preoperative vancomycin and Decadron.  He wa hooked up to the SSEP apparatus and had poor baseline and delays.,With a large a shoulder roll, I extended the patient's neck, and landmark incision in crease in the right upper neck, and the area wa then prepped and sterilely draped.  All the line had been put in and the arm were padded.,Using a knife and cautery, I took the incision down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue and arrived at the cervical spine.  Prominent osteophyte at C5-C6 wa noted, lesser at C4-C5.  Intraoperative x-ray confirmed our levels, and we were fully exposed from C3-C6.,Trimline retractor were put in, and I cut the disc out a well a removed the superficial hyperstatic bone and osteophytes.,With the drill, I performed a superficial discectomy and endplate resection, curetting the endplate a I went.  I then brought in the microscope, under the microscopic guidance, firmly removed the end plate and drilled through the posterior longitudinal ligament to decompress the spinal cord.  Worst finding at C3-C4 followed C5-C6 and then C4-C5.  Excellent thecal sac decompression wa achieved and foraminal decompression wa also achieved.  With change in intraoperative monitoring, a microscope wa used for this decompressive procedure.,The patient wa very oozy throughout this procedure, and during the decompression part, the oozing wa constant.  This wa partly due to the patient's cancellous bone, but he had been on aspirin which wa stopped only 2 day ago, and the option wa not available to wait 2 to 3 week which would have made this man worse simply over time.  I thus elected to give him DDAVP, platelets, and used Horsley bone wax for excellent hemostasis.  This took literally half-an-hour to an hour and added to the complexity and difficulty of this case.  Eventually, with blood pressure controlled and all the other parameter under control, bleeding wa somewhat slow.,I then selected two 10 and one 9-mm cadaveric allograft, which had soaking in bacitracin solution.  These were trimmed to the desired dimensions, and under slight distraction, these were tapped into position.  Excellent graft alignment wa achieved.,I now brought in a DePuy titanium eagle plate, and I fixed it to the spine from C3 to C6.  Fourteen millimeter screw were used; all the screw were tightened and torqued.  The patient's bone quality wa poor, but the screw did torque appropriately.  I inspected the plate, controlled the hemostasis, assessed post-fixation x-ray, and wa really happy with the screw length and the overall alignment.,The wound wa irrigated with antibiotic solution; a Jackson-Pratt drain 10-French wa put in with trocar.  Decision wa made to start the closure.  So, I closed the platysma with 3-0 Vicryl and used staple for the skin.  A simple Primapore or Medpore dressing wa applied.  The patient wa extubated in the OR and taken to the PSU in stable medical condition.,When I saw the patient in the ICU, he wa awake, alert, and moving all four extremities, somewhat weak on the left side.  He had done well from the surgery.  Blood loss wa 350 cc.  All instrument, needle, and sponge count were correct.  No complications, no change in intraoperative monitoring.  No specimen were sent.,The patient's wife wa spoken to and fully appraised of the intraoperative finding and the expected prognosis.  The patient will be kept n.p.o. tonight and will gradually advance his diet, and also will gradually advance his activity.  I will keep him on Decadron and keep the collar on.  I do not think there is need for halo rest.  We will be obtaining formal C-spine film in the morning.  Prognosis is guarded but favorable at this time. ",1.0

Dr. D noted the presence of minor anterior compression of some mid thoracic vertebra of indeterminate age, resulting in some increased kyphosis. Some of the mid thoracic disc demonstrate finding consistent with degenerative disc disease, without a significant posterior disc bulging or disc herniation. There are some vertebral end-plate abnormalities, consistent with small Schmorl's nodes, one on the superior aspect of T7, which is compressed anteriorly, and on the inferior aspect of T6.,May 12, 2003: He wa seen at the Outpatient Clinic by Dr. L, internal medicine specialist.

Mr. Abc told Dr. R that he wa the restrained passenger of a vehicle that wa rear-ended at a moderate speed. He stated that he experienced immediate discomfort in his thoracic spine area without radiation. He further stated that thoracic spine x-ray were obtained at the Sunnyside Emergency Room and read a normal. It is noted that Mr. Abc wa treated conservatively and then referred to physical therapy where he had a number of visit in late of 2002 and early 2003. No further chart entry were documented about the back problem until Mr. Abc complained to Dr. L that he still had ongoing thoracic spine pain during a visit the previous month. He obtained an MRI, out of pocket, at ABCD Hospital and stated that he paid $1100 for it. Dr. R asked to see the MRI and wa told by Mr. Abc that he would have to reimburse or pay him $1100 first. He then told the doctor that the interpretation wa that he had a T7 and T8 compression fracture. Mr. Abc reported his improvement at about 20%, compared to how he felt immediately after the accident. He described that his only symptom are an aching pain that occurs after sitting for four to five hours. If he take a break from sitting and walk around, his symptom resolve. He is noted to be able to bike, ski, and be active in his garden without any symptom at all. He denied upper extremity radicular symptoms. He denied lower extremity weakness or discoordination. He also denied bowel or bladder control or sensation issues. Dr. R noted that Mr. Abc wa hostile about the Kaiser health plan and wa quite uncommunicative, only reluctantly revealing his history. The physical examination revealed that he moved about the examination room without difficulty and exhibited normal lumbosacral range of motion. There wa normal thoracic spine motion with good chest expansion. Neurovascular examination of the upper extremity wa recorded a normal. There wa no spasticity in the lower extremities. There wa no tenderness to palpation or percussion up and down the thoracic spine. Dr. R reviewed the thoracic spine film and noted the presence of ""a little compression of what appears to be T7 and T8 on the lateral view."" Dr. R observed that this wa not noted on the original x-ray interpretation. He further stated that the MRI, a noted above, wa not available for review. Dr. R assessed that Mr. Abc wa experiencing minimal thoracic spine complaint that probably related to the motor vehicle accident three year previously. The doctor further stated that ""the patient's symptom are so mild a to almost not warrant intervention."" He discussed the need to make sure that Mr. Abc's workstation wa ergonomic and that Mr. Abc could pursue core strengthening. He further recommended that Mr. Abc look into participation in a Pilates class. Mr. Abc wa insistent, so Dr. R made plan to order a bone scan to further discriminate the etiology of his symptoms. He advised Mr. Abc that the bone scan result would probably not change treatment. As a result of this visit, Dr. R diagnosed thoracic spine pain (724.1) and ordered a bone scan study. ",1.0

Transaminases are continuing to trend upwards of SGOT 546, SGPT 256.  Also noted is a scant amount of very concentrated appearing urine in the bag.,IMPRESSION: , Overall impression continues to be critically ill 67-year-old with multiple medical problem probably still showing sign of volume depletion with hypotension and atrial flutter with difficult to control rate.,PLAN,1.  Hypotension.  I would aggressively try and fluid replete the patient giving him another liter of fluids.  If this doe not work a discussed with Dr. X, we will start some Neo-Synephrine, but also continue with aggressive fluid repletion a I do think that indication are that with diminished and concentrated urine that he may still be down and fluid will still be required even if pressure support is started.,2.  Increased transaminases.  Presumably this is from increased congestion.  This is certainly concerning.  We will continue to follow this.  Ultrasound of the liver wa apparently negative.,3.  Fever and elevated white count.  The patient doe have a history of pneumonia and empyema.  We will continue current antibiotic per infectious disease and continue to follow the patient's white count.  He is not exceptionally toxic appearing at this time.  Indeed, he doe look improved from my last examination.,4.  Ventilatory-dependent respiratory failure.  The patient ha received a tracheostomy since my last examination.  Vent management per PMA.,5.  Hypokalemia.  This ha resolved.  Continue supplementation.,6.  Hypernatremia.  This is improving somewhat.  I am hoping that with increased fluid this will continue to do so.,7.  Diabetes mellitus.  Fingerstick blood glucose are reviewed and are at target.  We will continue current management.  This is a critically ill patient with multiorgan dysfunction and sign of worsening renal, hepatic, and cardiovascular function with extremely guarded prognosis.

She ha developed worsening confusion, fever, and intractable diarrhea.  She wa brought to the emergency department for evaluation.  Diagnostic study in the emergency department included a CBC, which revealed a white blood cell count of 23,500, and a low potassium level of 2.6.  She wa admitted to the hospital for treatment of profound hypokalemia, dehydration, intractable diarrhea, and febrile illness.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Recent history of pneumonia, urosepsis, dementia, amputation, osteoporosis, and hypothyroidism.,MEDICATIONS:  ,Synthroid, clindamycin, ceftriaxone, Remeron, Actonel, Zanaflex, and hydrocodone.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient ha been residing at South Valley Care Center.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , The patient is unable answer review of systems.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  This is a very elderly, cachectic woman lying in bed in no acute distress.,HEENT:  Examination is normocephalic and atraumatic.

The basic chemistry panel is remarkable for potassium 2.6, calcium 7.5, and albumin 2.3.,IMPRESSION/PLAN:,1.  Elevated white count.  This patient is admitted to the hospital for treatment of a febrile illness.  There is concern that she ha a progression of pneumonia.  She may have aspirated.  She ha been treated with ceftriaxone and clindamycin.  I will follow her oxygen saturation and chest x-ray closely.  She is allergic to penicillin.  Therefore, clindamycin is the appropriate antibiotic for possible aspiration.,2.  Intractable diarrhea.  The patient ha been experiencing intractable diarrhea.  I am concerned about Clostridium difficile infection with possible pseudomembranous colitis.  I will send her stool for Clostridium difficile toxin assay.  I will consider treating with metronidazole.,3.  Hypokalemia.  The patient's profound hypokalemia is likely secondary to her diarrhea.  I will treat her with supplemental potassium.,4.

1958,"REASON FOR VISIT: , The patient is an 84-year-old man who return for revaluation of possible idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus.  He is accompanied by his wife and daughter.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  I first saw him nearly a year ago on December 20, 2007.  At that time, he had had a traumatic deterioration over the course of approximately eight months.  This included severe cognitive impairment, gait impairment, and incontinence.  He had actually been evaluated at Hospital with CSF drainage via a temporary spinal catheter, but there wa no response that wa noted.  When I saw him, there were finding consistent with cervical stenosis and I ordered an MRI scan of the cervical spine.  I subsequently referred him to Dr. X, who performed a cervical laminectomy and instrumented fusion on July 16, 2008.  According to his note this went well.,According to the family, there ha not been any improvement.,With regard to the gait and balance, they actually think that he is worse now than he wa a year ago.  He is virtually unable to walk at all.  He need both a walker and support from an assistant to be able to stand or walk.  Therefore, he is always in the wheelchair.,He is completely incontinent.  He never indicates his need to the go to the bathroom.  On the other hand when asked, he will indicate that he need to go.  He wear a Depends undergarment all the time.,He ha no headaches.,His thinking and memory are worse.  For the most part, he is apathetic.  He doe not talk very much.  He life in a skilled nursing facility in the Alzheimer's section.  He doe have some daytime activities.  He take a nap once a day.  He doe not read very much.  On the other hand, he did recently exercise the right to vote in the presidential election.  He need full assistance at the nursing home.,MEDICATIONS:,  From the list by the nursing home are Aricept 10 mg in the evening, carbidopa/levodopa 25/100 mg three time a day, citalopram (Celexa) 40 mg daily, Colace 100 mg twice a day, finasteride (Proscar) 5 mg once a day, Flomax (tamsulosin) 0.4 mg once a day, multivitamin with iron once a day, omeprazole (Prilosec) 20 mg once a day, senna 8.6 mg twice a day, Tylenol 650 mg a needed, and promethazine 25 mg a needed.,PHYSICAL EXAM: , On examination today, this is a pleasant 81-year-old man who is brought back from the clinic waiting area in a wheelchair.  He is well developed, well nourished, and kempt.,Vital Signs:  Temperature 96.7, pulse 62, respiration 16, and blood pressure 123/71.,Head:  The head is normocephalic and atraumatic.,Mental Status:  Assessed for orientation, recent and remote memory, attention span, concentration, language, and fund of knowledge.  The Mini-Mental State Exam score wa 14/30.  He wa not at all oriented.  He did know we were at Sinai Hospital on the second floor.  He could spell 'world' forward, but wa mute when asked to spell backwards.  He wa mute when asked to recall 3/3 object for delayed recall.  He could not copy a diagram of intersecting pentagons.  For comparison, the Mini-Mental State exam score last December wa 20/30 when attention wa tested by having him spell 'world' backwards and 28/30 when tested with serial 7 subtractions.  Additionally, there are time when he stutter or stammers.  I do not see any paraphasic errors.  There is some evidence of ideomotor apraxia.  He is also stimulus bound.  There is a tendency to mimic.,Cranial Nerve Exam:  There is no upgaze that I can elicit today.  The horizontal gaze and down gaze are intact.  This is a change from a year ago.  The muscle of facial expiration are intact a are hearing, head turning, cough, tongue, and palate movement.,Motor Exam:  Normal bulk and strength.  The tone is characterized by paratonia.  There is no atrophy, fasciculations, drift, or tremor.,Sensory Exam:  Intact to light touch.,Cerebellar Exam:  Intact for finger-to-nose testing that he can perform only by mimicking, but not by following verbal commands.,Gait:  Severely impaired.  When in the wheelchair, he lean to one side.  He cannot getup on his own.  He need assistance.  Once up, he can bear weight, but cannot maintain his balance.  This would amount to a Tinetti score of zero.,REVIEW OF X-RAYS: , I personally reviewed the CT scan of the brain from November 1, 2008 and compared it to the MRI scan from a year ago.  The ventricle appear larger to me now in comparison to a year ago.  The frontal horn span is now 6 cm, whereas previously it wa about 5.5 cm.  The 3rd ventricular span is about 15 mm.  There is no obvious atrophy, although there may be some subtle bilateral perisylvian atrophy.  The scan from a year ago showed that there wa a patent sylvian aqueduct.,ASSESSMENT:,  The patient ha had worsening of his gait, his dementia, and his incontinence.  The new finding for me today is the limited upgaze.  This would be consistent either with progressive supranuclear palsy, which wa one of the differential diagnosis a year ago, or it could be consistent with progressive enlargement of the ventricles.,PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES:,1.  Question of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (331.5).,2.  Possible supranuclear palsy.,3.  Severe gait impairment.,4.  Urinary urgency and incontinence.,5.  Dementia.,PLAN: , I had a long talk with him and his family.  Even though he ha already had a trial of CSF drainage via spinal catheter at Hospital over a year ago, I offered this test to them again.  I do so on the basis that there is further enlargement of the ventricle on the scan.  His family and I discussed the fact that it is not likely to be only hydrocephalus.  Instead we are trying to answer the question of whether hydrocephalus is contributing sufficiently to his symptom that progressing with shunt surgery would make a difference.  I have advised them to think it over for a day and contact my office to see whether they would wish to proceed.  I gave them a printed prescription of the protocol including it rationale, risks, benefits, and alternatives.  I specifically mentioned the 3% chance of infection, which mean a 97% chance of no infection. ",1.0

The vertigo had not been consistently associated with positional change and could last hour to days.,On 3/15/71, after 5 day bout of vertigo, right ear ache, and difficulty ambulating (secondary to the vertigo) she sought medical attention and underwent an audiogram which reportedly showed a 20% decline in low tone acuity AD. She complained of associated tinnitus which she described a a ""whistle."" In addition, her symptom appeared to worsen with change in head position (i.e. looking up or down). The symptom gradually resolved and she did well until 8/71 when she experienced a 19-day episode of vertigo, tinnitus and intermittent headaches. She wa seen 9/14/71, in Neurology, and admitted for evaluation.,Her neurologic exam at that time wa unremarkable except for prominent bilateral systolic carotid bruits. Cerebral angiogram revealed an inoperable 7 x 6cm AVM in the right parietal region. The AVM wa primarily fed by the right MCA. Otolaryngologic evaluation concluded that she probably also suffered from Meniere's disease.,On 10/14/74 she underwent a 21 day admission for SAH secondary to right parietal AVM.,On 11/23/91 she wa admitted for left sided weakness (LUE > LLE), headache, and transient visual change. Neurological exam confirmed left sided weakness, and dysesthesia of the LUE only. Brain CT confirmed a 3 x 4 cm left parietal hemorrhage. She underwent unsuccessful embolization. Neuroradiology had planned to do 3 separate embolizations, but during the first, via the left MCA, they were unable to cannulate many of the AVM vessel and abandoned the procedure. She recovered with residual left hemisensory loss.,In 12/92 she presented with an interventricular hemorrhage and wa managed conservatively and refused any future neuroradiologic intervention.,In 1/93 she reconsidered neurointerventional procedure and wa scheduled for evaluation at the Barrows Neurological Institute in Phoenix, AZ.

Using a size 1 reamer, the medullary canal wa entered and reamed up to size 3, which gave u a satisfactory fit into the canal.  At this point, a trial prosthesis size 3 with 45 mm calcar body wa inserted.  Appropriate anteversion wa positioned.  The anteversion wa marked with a Bovie to identify subsequent anteversion during implantation.  The bony edge were trimmed.  The calcar implant with 45 mm neck length wa fit in the host femur very well.  There wa no evidence of any subsidence.  At this point, trial reduction wa performed using a bipolar trial head with 0 neck length.  The relationship between the central femoral head and the greater trochanter wa satisfactory.  The hip wa well reduced without any difficulty.  The stability and range of motion in extension and external rotation a well a flexion-adduction, internal rotation wa satisfactory.  The shuck wa le than 1 mm.  Leg length wa satisfactory in reference to the contralateral leg.  Stability wa satisfactory at 90 degree of flexion and hip at 75-80 degree of internal rotation.  Similarly, keeping the leg completely adducted, I wa able to internally rotate the hip to 45 degrees.  After verifying the stability and range of motion in all direction, trial component were removed.  The canal wa thoroughly irrigated and dry sponge wa inserted and canal wa dried completely.  At this point, 2 batch of SmartSet cement with antibiotic were mixed.  The definitive Ultima calcar stem size 3 with 45 mm calcar body wa selected.  Centralizer wa positioned.  The cement restrictor wa inserted.  Retrograde cementing technique wa applied once the canal wa dried.  Using cement gun, retrograde cementing wa performed.  The stem wa then inserted into cemented canal with appropriate anteversion, which wa maintained until the cement wa set hard and cured.  The excess cement wa removed with the help of a curette and Freer elevator.  All the cement debris wa removed.,Attention wa now placed for the insertion of the trial femoral head.  Once again, 0 neck length trial bipolar head wa inserted over the trunnion.  It wa reduced and range of motion and stability wa satisfactory.  I also attempted with a -3 trial head, but the 0 gave u a satisfactory stability, range of motion, a well a the length and the shuck wa also minimal.  The hip wa raised to 90 degree of flexion and 95 degree of internal rotation.  There wa no evidence of any impingement on extension and external rotation a well a flexion-adduction, internal rotation.  I also tested the hip at 90 degree of flexion with 10 degree adduction and internal rotation and further progressive flexion of the hip beyond 90 degrees, which wa noted to be very stable.  At this point, a definitive component using +0 neck length and bipolar 43 head were placed over the trunnion and the hip wa reduced.  Range of motion and stability wa a above.  Now, the attention wa placed for the repair of the capsule and the external rotators and the piriformis.  This wa repaired to the trochanteric insertion using #5 Ethibond and suture plaster.  Satisfactory reinforcement wa achieved with the #5 Ethibond.  The wound wa thoroughly irrigated.  Hemostasis wa achieved.

2052,"REASON FOR FOLLOWUP:,  Care conference with family at the bedside and decision to change posture of care from aggressive full code status to terminal wean with comfort care measure in a patient with code last night with CPR and advanced cardiac life support.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , This is a 65-year-old patient originally admitted by me several week ago with profound hyponatremia and mental status changes.  Her history is also significant for likely recurrent aspiration pneumonia and intubation earlier on this admission a well.  Previously while treating this patient I had met with the family and discussed how aggressive the patient would wish her level of care to be given that there wa evidence of possible ovarian malignancy with elevated CA-125 and a complex mass located in the ovary.  As the patient wa showing sign of improvement with some speech and ability to follow commands, decision wa made to continue to pursue an aggressive level of care, treat her dysphagia, hypertension, debilitation and this wa being done.  However, last night the patient had apparently catastrophic event around 2:40 in the morning.  Rapid response wa called and the patient wa intubated, started on pressure support, and given CPR.  This morning I wa called to the bedside by nursing stating the family had wished at this point not to continue this aggressive level of care.  The patient wa seen and examined, she wa intubated and sedated.  Limbs were cool.  Cardiovascular exam revealed tachycardia.  Lungs had coarse breath sounds.  Abdomen wa soft.  Extremities were cool to the touch.  Pupils were 6 to 2 mm, doll's eye were not intact.  They were not responsive to light.  Based on discussion with all family member involved including both sons, daughter and daughter-in-law, a decision wa made to proceed with terminal wean and comfort care measures.  All pressure support wa discontinued.  The patient wa started on intravenous morphine and respiratory wa requested to remove the ET tube.  Monitors were turned off and the patient wa made a comfortable a possible.  Family is at the bedside at this time.  The patient appears comfortable and the family is in agreement that this would be her wish per my understanding of the family and the patient dynamic over the past month, this is a very reasonable and appropriate approach given the patient's failure to turn around after over a month of aggressive treatment with likely terminal illness from ovarian cancer and associated comorbidities.,Total time spent at the bedside today in critical care services, medical decision making and explaining option to the family and proceeding with terminal weaning wa excess of 37 minutes.

The patient complained of intractable nausea, vomiting, and abdominal bloating after eating fatty foods.  She had had multiple attack in the past of these complaints.  She wa discovered to have had right upper quadrant pain on examination.  Additionally, she had an ultrasound performed on 08/04/2003, which revealed cholelithiasis.  The patient wa recommended to undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy for her recurrent symptoms.  She wa explained the risks, benefits, and complication of the procedure and she gave informed consent to proceed.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient wa brought to the operative suite and placed in the supine position.  The patient received preoperative antibiotic with Kefzol.  The abdomen wa prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion with Betadine solution.  The patient did undergo general endotracheal anesthesia.  Once the adequate sedation wa achieved, a supraumbilical transverse incision wa created with a #10 blade scalpel.  Utilizing a Veress needle, the Veress needle wa inserted intra-abdominally and wa hooked to the CO2 insufflation.  The abdomen wa insufflated to 15 mmHg.  After adequate insufflation wa achieved, the laparoscopic camera wa inserted into the abdomen and to visualize a distended gallbladder a well a omental adhesion adjacent to the gallbladder.  Decision to proceed with laparoscopic cystectomy wa decided.  A subxiphoid transverse incision wa created with a #10 blade scalpel and utilizing a bladed 12 mm trocar, the trocar wa inserted under direct visualization into the abdomen.  Two 5 mm port were placed, one at the midclavicular line 2 cm below the costal margin and a second at the axillary line, one hand length approximately below the costal margin.  All port were inserted with bladed 5 mm trocar then under direct visualization.  After all trocars were inserted, the gallbladder wa grasped at the fundus and retracted superiorly and towards the left shoulder.  Adhesions adjacent were taken down with a Maryland dissector.  Once this wa performed, the infundibulum of the gallbladder wa grasped and retracted laterally and anteriorly.  This helped to better delineate the cystic duct a well a the cystic artery.  Utilizing Maryland dissector, careful dissection of the cystic duct and cystic artery were created posteriorly behind each one.  Utilizing Endoclips, clip were placed on the cystic duct and cystic artery, one proximal to the gallbladder and two distally.  Utilizing endoscissors, the cystic duct and cystic artery were ligated.  Next, utilizing electrocautery, the gallbladder wa carefully dissected off the liver bed.  Electrocautery wa used to stop any bleeding encountered along the way.  The gallbladder wa punctured during dissection and cleared, biliary content did drained into the abdomen.  No evidence of stone were visualized.  Once the gallbladder wa completely excised from the liver bed, an EndoCatch wa placed and the gallbladder wa inserted into EndoCatch and removed from the subxiphoid port.  This wa sent off a an specimen, a gallstone wa identified within the gallbladder.  Next, utilizing copious amount of irrigation, the abdomen wa irrigated.  A small liver cyst that have been identified upon initial aspiration wa grasped with a grasper and utilizing electrocautery wa completely excised off the left lobe of the liver.  This wa also taken and sent off a specimen.  The abdomen wa then copiously irrigated until clear irrigation wa identified.  All laparoscopic port were removed under direct visualization.  The abdomen wa de-insufflated.  Utilizing #0 Vicryl suture, the abdominal fascia wa approximated with a figure-of-eight suture in the supraumbilical and subxiphoid region.  All incision were then closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl.  Two midline incision were closed with a running subcuticular stitch and the lateral port were closed with interrupted sutures.  The area were cleaned and dried.  Steri-Strips were placed.  On the incisions, sterile dressing wa applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  She wa extubated following procedure.

Cardiopulmonary bypass time total wa ** minutes.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risk and benefit of the aforementioned procedure, the patient wa taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia wa administered.  Next, the patient's chest and leg were prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion.  A #10-blade scalpel wa used to make a midline median sternotomy incision.  Dissection wa carried down to the level of the sternum using Bovie electrocautery.  The sternum wa opened with a sternal saw, and full-dose heparinization wa given.  Next, the chest retractor wa positioned.  The pericardium wa opened with Bovie electrocautery and pericardial stay suture were positioned.  We then prepared to place the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass.  A 2-0 Ethibond double pursestring wa placed in the ascending aorta.  Through this wa passed our aortic cannula and connected to the arterial side of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine.  Next, double cannulation with venous cannula wa instituted.  A 3-0 Prolene pursestring wa placed in the right atrial appendage.  Through this wa passed our SEC cannula.  This wa connected to the venous portion of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine in a Y-shaped circuit.  Next, a 3-0 Prolene pursestring wa placed in the lower border of the right atrium.  Through this wa passed our inferior vena cava cannula.  This wa likewise connected to the Y connection of our venous cannula portion.  We then used a 4-0 U-stitch in the right atrium for our retrograde cardioplegia catheter, which wa inserted.  Cardiopulmonary bypass wa instituted.  Metzenbaum scissors were used to dissect out the SVC and IVC, which were subsequently encircled with umbilical tape.  Sondergaard's groove wa taken down.  Next, an antegrade cardioplegia needle and associated sump were placed in the ascending aorta.  This wa connected appropriately a wa the retrograde cardioplegia catheter.  Next, the aorta wa cross-clamped, and antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia wa infused so a to arrest the heart in diastole.  Next a #15-blade scalpel wa used to open the left atrium.  The left atrium wa decompressed with pump sucker.  Next, our self-retaining retractor wa positioned so a to bring the mitral valve up into view.  Of note wa the fact that the mitral valve P2 segment of the posterior leaflet had an abscess associated with it.  The border of the P2 segment abscess were defined by using a right angle to define the chordae which were encircled with a 4-0 silk.  After doing so, the P2 segment of the posterior leaflet wa excised with a #11-blade scalpel.  Given the laxity of the posterior leaflet, it wa decided to reconstruct it with a 2-0 Ethibond pledgeted suture.  This wa done so a to reconstruct the posterior annular portion.  Prior to doing so, care wa taken to remove any debris and abscess-type material.  The pledgeted stitch wa lowered into place and tied.  Next, the more anterior portion of the P2 segment wa reconstructed by running a 4-0 Prolene stitch so a to reconstruct it.  This wa done without difficulty.  The apposition of the anterior and posterior leaflet wa confirmed by infusing solution into the left ventricle.  There wa noted to be a small amount of central regurgitation.  It wa felt that this would be corrected with our annuloplasty portion of the procedure.  Next, 2-0 non-pledgeted Ethibond suture were placed in the posterior portion of the annulus from trigone to trigone in interrupted fashion.  Care wa taken to go from trigone to trigone.  Prior to placing these sutures, the annulus wa sized and noted to be a *** size for the Cosgrove-Galloway suture band ring from Medtronic.  After, a mentioned, we placed our interrupted suture in the annulus, and they were passed through the CG suture band.  The suture band wa lowered into position and tied in place.  We then tested our repair and noted that there wa very mild regurgitation.  We subsequently removed our self-retaining retractor.  We closed our left atriotomy using 4-0 Prolene in a running fashion.  This wa done without difficulty.  We de-aired the heart.  We then gave another round of antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia in warm fashion.  The aortic cross-clamp wa removed, and the heart gradually resumed electromechanical activity.  We then removed our retrograde cardioplegia catheter from the coronary sinus and buttressed this site with a 5-0 Prolene.  We placed 2 ventricular and 2 atrial pacing lead which were brought out through the skin.  The patient wa gradually weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass and our venous cannula were removed.  We then gave full-dose protamine; and after noting that there wa no evidence of a protamine reaction, we removed our aortic cannula.  This site wa buttressed with a 4-0 Prolene on an SH needle.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  We placed a mediastinal #32-French chest tube a well a a right chest Blake drain.  The mediastinum wa inspected for any sign of bleeding.  There were none.  We closed the sternum with #7 sternal wire in interrupted figure-of-eight fashion.  The fascia wa closed with a #1 Vicryl followed by a 2-0 Vicryl, followed by 3-0 Vicryl in a running subcuticular fashion.  The instrument and sponge count wa correct at the end of the case.

Peyronie's disease.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Ex-plantation of inflatable penile prosthesis and then placement of second inflatable penile prosthesis AMS700.,ANESTHESIA:,  General LMA.,SPECIMEN: , Old triple component inflatable penile prosthesis.,PROCEDURE:  ,This is a 64-year-old male with prior history of Peyronie's disease and prior placement of a triple component inflatable penile prosthesis, which had worked for year for him, but ha stopped working and subsequently ha opted for ex-plantation and replacement of inflatable penile prosthesis.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , After informed consent, the patient wa brought to the operative suite and placed in the supine position.  General endotracheal intubation wa performed by the Anesthesia Department and the perineum, scrotum, penis, and lower abdomen from the umbilicus down wa prepped and draped in the sterile fashion in a 15-minute prep including iodine solution in the urethra.  The bladder wa subsequently drained with a red Robinson catheter.  At that point, the patient wa then draped in a sterile fashion and an infraumbilical midline incision wa made and taken down through the subcutaneous space.  Care wa maintained to avoid all bleeding a possible secondary to the fact that we could not use Bovie cautery secondary to the patient's pacemaker and monopolar wa only source of hemostasis besides suture.  At that point, we got down to the fascia and the dorsal venous complex wa easily identified a were both corporal bodies.  Attention wa taken then to the tubing, going up to the reservoir in the right lower quadrant.  This wa dissected out bluntly and sharply with Metzenbaum scissors and monopolar used for hemostasis.  At this point, a we tracked this proximally to the area of the rectus muscle, we found that the tubing wa violated and this wa likely the source of his malfunctioned inflatable penile prosthesis.  As we tried to remove the tubing and get to the reservoir, the tubing in fact completely broke a due to wire inside the tubing and the reservoir wa left in it place secondary to risk of going after it and bleeding without the use of cautery.  At that point, this tubing wa then tracked down to the pump, which wa fairly easily removed from the dartos pouch in the right scrotum.  This wa brought up into _________ incision and the two tubing going towards the two cylinder were subsequently tracked, first starting on the right side where a corporotomy incision wa made at the placement of two #3-0 Prolene stay ties, staying lateral and anterior on the corporal body.  The corporal body wa opened up and the cylinder wa removed from the right side without difficulty.  However, we did have significant difficulty separating the tube connecting the pump to the right cylinder since this wa surrounded by dense connective tissue and without the use of Bovie cautery, this wa very difficult and wa very time consuming, but we were able to do this and attention wa then taken to the left side where the left proximal corporotomy wa made after placement of two stick tie stay sutures.  This wa done anterior and lateral staying away from the neurovascular bundle in the midline and this wa done proximally on the corporal body.  The left cylinder wa then subsequently explanted and this wa very difficult a well trying to tract the tubing from the left cylinder across the midline back to the right pump since this wa also densely scarred in and _________ a small amount of bleeding, which wa controlled with monopolar and cautery wa used on three different occasions, but just simple small burst under the guidance of anesthesia and there wa no ectopy noted.  After removal of half of the pump, all the tubing, and both cylinders, these were passed off the table a specimen.  Both corporal body were then dilated with the Pratt dilators.  These were already fairly well dilated secondary to explantation of our cylinder and antibiotic irrigation wa copiously used at this point and irrigated out both of our corporal spaces.  At this point, using the Farlow device, corporal body were measured first proximally then distally and they both measured out to be 9 cm proximally and 12 cm distally.  He had an 18 cm with rear tip in place, which were removed.  We decided to go ahead to and use another 18 cm inflatable penile prosthesis.  Confident with our size, we then placed rear tips, originally 3 cm rear tips, however, we had difficulty placing the rear tip into the left crest.  We felt that this wa just a little bit too long and replaced both rear tip and down sized from 2 cm to 1 cm.  At this point, we went ahead and placed the right cylinder using the Farlow device and the Keith needle, which wa brought out through the glans penis and hemostated and the posterior rear tip wa subsequently placed proximally, entered the crest without difficulty.  Attention wa then taken to the left side with the same thing wa carried out, however, we did happen to dilate on two separate occasion both proximally and distally secondary to a very snug fit a well a buckling of the cylinders.  This then forced u to down size to the 1 cm rear tips, which slipping very easily with the Farlow device through the glans penis.  There wa no crossover and no violation of the tunica albuginea.  The rear tip were then placed without difficulty and our corporotomies were closed with #2-0 PDS in a running fashion.  ________ starting on the patient's right side and then on the left side without difficulty and care wa maintained to avoid damage or needle injury to the implants.  At that point, the wound wa copiously irrigated and the device wa inflated multiple times.  There wa a very good fit and we had a very good result.  At that point, the pump wa subsequently placed in the dartos pouch, which already ha been created and wa copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution.  This wa held in place with a Babcock a well not to migrate proximally and attention wa then taken to our connection from the reservoir to the pump.  Please also note that before placement of our pump, attention wa then taken up to the left lower quadrant where an incision wa then made in external oblique aponeurosis, approximately 3 cm dissection down underneath the rectus space wa developed for our reservoir device, which wa subsequently placed without difficulty and three simple interrupted suture of #2-0 Vicryl used to close the defect in the rectus and at that point after placement of our pump, the connection wa made between the pump and the reservoir without difficulty.  The entire system pump and corporal body were subsequently flushed and all air bubble were evacuated.  After completion of the connection using a straight connector, the prosthesis wa inflated and we had very good result with air inflation with good erection in both cylinder with a very slight deviation to the left, but this wa able to be ________ with good cosmetic result.  At that point, after irrigation again of the space, the area wa simply dry and hemostatic.  The soft tissue wa reapproximated to separate the cylinder so a not to lie in rope against one another and the wound wa closed in multiple layers.  The soft tissue and the skin wa then reapproximated with staples.  Please also note that prior to the skin closure, a Jackson-Pratt drain wa subsequently placed through the left skin and left lower quadrant and subsequently placed just over tubings, would be left in place for approximately 12 to 20 hours.  This wa also sutured in place with nylon.  Sterile dressing wa applied.  Light gauze wa wrapped around the penis and/or suture that begin at the tip of the glans penis were subsequently cut and removed in entirety bilaterally.  Coban wa used then to wrap the penis and at the end of the case the patient wa straight catheted, approximately 400 cc of amber-yellow urine.  No Foley catheter wa used or placed.,The patient wa awoken in the operative suite, extubated, and transferred to recovery room in stable condition.  He will be admitted overnight to the service of Dr. McDevitt.  Cardiology will be asked to consult with Dr. Stomel for a pacer placement and he will be placed on the Telemetry floor and kept on IV antibiotics. ",1.0

She had a medial breech of a right L4 pedicle screw.  We took her back to the operating room same night and reinserted the screw.  Postoperatively, her pain had improved.,I had last seen her on 06/28/07 at which time she wa doing well.  She had symptom of what she thought wa ""restless leg syndrome"" at that time.  She ha been put on ReQuip for this.,She returned.  I had spoken to her 2 day ago and she had stated that her right lower extremity pain wa markedly improved.  I had previously evaluated this for a pain possibly relating to deep venous thrombosis and ultrasound wa negative.  She state that she had recurrent left lower extremity pain, which wa similar to the pain she had preoperatively but in a different distribution, further down the leg.  Thus, I referred her for a lumbar spine radiograph and lumbar spine MRI and she present today for evaluation.,She state that overall, she is improved compared to preoperatively.  She is ambulating better than she wa preoperatively.  The pain is not a severe a it wa preoperatively.  The right leg pain is improved.  The left lower extremity pain is in a left L4 and L5 distribution radiating to the great toe and first web space on the left side.,She denies any significant low back pain.

1803,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Large and invasive recurrent pituitary adenoma.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Large and invasive recurrent pituitary adenoma.,OPERATION PERFORMED: , Endoscopic-assisted transsphenoidal exploration and radical excision of pituitary adenoma, endoscopic exposure of sphenoid sinus with removal of tissue from within the sinus, harvesting of dermal fascia abdominal fat graft, placement of abdominal fat graft into sella turcica, reconstruction of sellar floor using autologous nasal bone creating a cranioplasty of le than 5 cm, repair of nasal septal deviation, using the operating microscope and microdissection technique, and placement of lumbar subarachnoid catheter connected to reservoir for aspiration and infusion.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , This man ha undergone one craniotomy and 2 previous transsphenoidal resection of his tumor, which is known to be an invasive pituitary adenoma.  He did not return for followup or radiotherapy a instructed, and the tumor ha regrown.  For this reason, he is admitted for transsphenoidal reoperation with an attempt to remove a much tumor a possible.  The high-risk nature of the procedure and the fact that postoperative radiation is mandatory wa made clear to him.  Many risk including CSF leak and blindness were discussed in detail.  After clear understanding of all the same, he elected to proceed ahead with surgery.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient wa placed on the operating table, and after adequate induction of general anesthesia, he wa placed in the left lateral decubitus position.  Care wa taken to pad all pressure point appropriately.  The back wa prepped and draped in usual sterile manner.,A 14-gauge Tuohy needle wa introduced into the lumbar subarachnoid space.  Clear and colorless CSF issued forth.  A catheter wa inserted to a distance of 40 cm, and the needle wa removed.  The catheter wa then connected to a closed drainage system for aspiration and infusion.,This no-touch technique is now a standard of care for treatment of patient with large invasive adenomas.  Via injection through the lumbar drain, one increase intracranial pressure and produce gentle migration of the tumor.  This improves outcome and reduces complication by atraumatically dissecting the tumor away from the optic apparatus.,The patient wa then placed supine, and the 3-point headrest wa affixed.  He wa placed in the semi-sitting position with the head turned to the right and a roll placed under the left shoulder.  Care wa taken to pad all pressure point appropriately.  The fluoroscope C-arm unit wa then positioned so a to afford an excellent view of the sella and sphenoid sinus in the lateral projection.  The metallic arm wa then connected to the table for the use of the endoscope.  The oropharynx, nasopharynx, and abdominal area were then prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.,A transverse incision wa made in the abdominal region, and several large piece of fat were harvested for later use.  Hemostasis wa obtained.  The wound wa carefully closed in layers.,I then advanced a 0-degree endoscope up the left nostril.  The middle turbinate wa identified and reflected laterally exposing the sphenoid sinus ostium.  Needle Bovie electrocautery wa used to clear mucosa away from the ostium.  The perpendicular plate of the ethmoid had already been separated from the sphenoid.  I entered into the sphenoid.,There wa a tremendous amount of dense fibrous scar tissue present, and I slowly and carefully worked through all this.  I identified a previous sellar opening and widely opened the bone, which had largely regrown out to the cavernous sinus laterally on the left, which wa very well exposed, and the cavernous sinus on the right, which I exposed the very medial portion of.  The opening wa wide until I had the horizontal portion of the floor to the tuberculum sella present.,The operating microscope wa then utilized.  Working under magnification, I used hypophysectomy placed in the nostril.,The dura wa then carefully opened in the midline, and I immediately encountered tissue consistent with pituitary adenoma.  A frozen section wa obtained, which confirmed this diagnosis without malignant features.,Slowly and meticulously, I worked to remove the tumor.  I used the suction apparatus a well a the bipolar coagulating forceps and ring and cup curette to begin to dissect tumor free.  The tumor wa moderately vascular and very fibrotic.,Slowly and carefully, I systematically entered the sellar content until I could see the cavernous sinus wall on the left and on the right.  There appeared to be cavernous sinus invasion on the left.  It wa consistent with what we saw on the MRI imaging.,The portion working into the suprasellar cistern wa slowly dissected down by injecting saline into the lumbar subarachnoid catheter.  A large amount of this wa removed.  There wa a CSF leak, a the tumor wa removed for the upper surface of it wa very adherent to the arachnoid and could not be separated free.,Under high magnification, I actually worked up into this cavity and performed a very radical excision of tumor.  While there may be a small amount of tumor remaining, it appeared that a radical excision had been created with decompression of the optic apparatus.  In fact, I reinserted the endoscope and could see the optic chiasm well.,I reasoned that I had therefore achieved the goal with that is of a radical excision and decompression.  Attention wa therefore turned to closure.,The wound wa copiously irrigated with Bacitracin solution, and meticulous hemostasis wa obtained.  I asked Anesthesiology to perform a Valsalva maneuver, and there wa no evidence of bleeding.,Attention wa turned to closure and reconstruction.  I placed a very large piece of fat in the sella to seal the leak and verified that there wa no fat in the suprasellar cistern by using fluoroscopy and looking at the pattern of the air.  Using a polypropylene insert, I reconstructed the sellar floor with this implant making a nice tight sling and creating a cranioplasty of le than 5 cm.,DuraSeal wa placed over this, and the sphenoid sinus wa carefully packed with fat and DuraSeal.,I inspected the nasal passage and restored the septum precisely to the midline repairing a previous septal deviation.  The middle turbinate were then restored to their anatomic position.  There wa no significant intranasal bleeding, and for this reason, an open nasal packing wa required.  Sterile dressing were applied, and the operation wa terminated.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and left to the recovery room in excellent condition.  The sponge and needle count were reported a correct, and there were no intraoperative complications.,Specimens were sent to Pathology consisting of tumor. ",1.0

At baseline, he can put about 2 to 4 word together in brief sentences.  His speech is not always easily understood; however, he is in a special education classroom in kindergarten.  He ambulates independently, but fall often.  He ha difficulty with his left side compared to the right, and prefers to use the right upper extremity more than the left.  Mother report he posture the left upper extremity when running.  He is being followed by Medical Therapy Unit and ha also been seen in the past by Dr. X.  He ha not received Botox or any other intervention with regard to his cerebral palsy.,The patient did require one shunt revision, but since then his shunt ha done well.,The patient developed seizure about 2 year ago.  These occurred periodically, but they are always in the same and with the involvement of the left side more than right and he had an eye deviation forcefully to the left side.  His events, however, always tend to be prolonged.  He ha had seizure a long a an hour and a half.  He tends to require multiple medication to stop them.  He ha been followed by Dr. Y and wa started on Trileptal.  At one point, The patient wa taken off his medication for presumed failure to prevent his seizures.  He wa more recently placed on Topamax since March 2007.  His last seizure were in March and May respectively.  He is worked up to a dose of 25 mg capsules, 2 capsule twice a day or about 5 mg/kg/day at this point.,The patient wa in his usual state of health until early this morning and wa noted to be in seizure.  His seizure this morning wa similar to the previous seizure with forced deviation of his head and eye to the left side and convulsion more on the left side than the right.  Family administered Diastat 7.5 mg x1 dose.  They did not know they could repeat this dose.  EMS wa called and he received lorazepam 2 mg and then in the emergency department, 15 mg/kg of fosphenytoin.  His seizure stopped thereafter, since that time, he had gradually become more alert and is eating, and is nearly back to baseline.  He is a bit off balance and tends to be a bit weaker on the left side compared to baseline postictally.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , At this time, he is positive for a low-grade fever, he ha had no sign of illness otherwise.

Gait wa not tested today.,IMPRESSION: , This is a 6-year-old male with recurrent status epilepticus, left hemiparesis, history of prematurity, and intraventricular hemorrhage.  He is on Topamax, which is at a moderate dose of 5 mg/kg a day or 50 mg twice a day.  At this point, it is not clear whether this medication will protect him or not, but the dose is clearly not at maximum, and he is tolerating the dose currently.  The plan will be to increase him up to 50 mg in the morning, and 75 mg at night for 2 weeks, and then 75 mg twice daily.  Reviewed the possible side effect of higher dos of Topamax, they will monitor him for language issues, cognitive problem or excessive somnolence.  I also discussed his imaging studies, which showed significant destruction of the cerebellum compared to other area and despite this, the patient at baseline ha a reasonable balance.  The plan from CT standpoint is to continue stretching program, continue with medical therapy unit.  He may benefit from Botox.,In addition, I reviewed the Diastat protocol with parent and given the patient tends to go into status epilepticus each time, they can administer Diastat immediately and not wait the standard 2 minute or even 5 minute that they were waiting before.  They are going to repeat the dose within 10 minute and they can call EMS at any point during that time.  Hopefully at home, they need to start to abort these seizure or the higher dose of Topamax will prevent them.  Other medication option would include Keppra, Zonegran or Lamictal.,FOLLOWUP: , Followup ha already been scheduled with Dr. Y in February and they will continue to keep that date for followup. ",1.0

She ha done quite well with this.  She now ha had worsening left knee pain predominantly on the inside of her knee and ha consented for unicompartmental knee replacement on the left.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient wa brought to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table.  After appropriate anesthesia, the left lower extremity wa identified with a time out procedure.  Preoperative antibiotic were given.  Left lower extremity wa then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion after applying a thigh tourniquet.  The tourniquet wa insufflated after elevation of the limb, and a standard medial parapatellar incision wa used.  Soft tissue dissection wa carried down the retinaculum, wa opened sharply to expose the joint, meniscus that wa visible along the tibia wa removed.  The anterior fat pad wa removed.  The knee wa then examined.  The ACL wa found to be intact.  The lateral compartment had very minimal arthritis.  There were some osteoarthritic change of the patellofemoral joint, but these were felt to be mild.  Following this, the tibial external alignment guide wa placed and pinned into place in the appropriate place.  Tibial bone cut wa made and checked with a feeler gauge and felt to be an adequate resection.  Following this resection, the femoral intramedullary guide wa placed without difficulty.  The femoral cutting guide wa then placed and referenced off of this femoral intramedullary guide.  Once in the appropriate position, it wa pinned and drilled.  This wa removed, and the posterior cutting block wa inserted.  It wa impacted into place.  Posterior bone cut wa made for the medium femoral component.  Next, a zero spigot wa used and the distal femur wa reamed.  Following this, the check of the extension and flexion gap revealed that an additional 1 mm needed to be reamed, so 1 spigot wa used and this wa reamed a well.  Next, trial component were placed into the knee and the knee wa taken through range of motion and felt to come out to full extension with a 3 mm poly with a good fit.  Next, the tibia wa prepared.  The tibial tray wa pinned into place, and the cut for the keel of the tibia were made.  These were removed with a small osteotome from the set.  Following this, a trial tibial with the keel wa placed and it did fit nicely.  After this, all trial component were removed.  The knee wa copiously irrigated.  Cement wa begun mixing.  Drill hole were used along the femur for cement interdigitation.  The wound wa cleaned and dried.  Cement wa placed on the tibia.  Tibial tray wa impacted into place.  Excess cement wa removed.  Tibia wa placed in the femur.  Femoral component wa impacted into place.  Excess cement wa removed.  It wa held with a 4 mm trial insert and approximately 30 degree of knee flexion until the cement had hardened.  Following this, it wa again trialed with a meniscal bearing implant and it wa felt that 3 mm would be the appropriate size.  A 3 mm polyethylene wa chosen and inserted in the knee without difficulty, taken through range of motion and found to come out to full extension with no impingement and full flexion.  The intramedullary rod removed from the femur.  The wound wa irrigated with normal saline.  The retinaculum wa closed with #1 PDS, 2-0 Monocryl wa used for the subcutaneous tissue and staple used for the skin.  A sterile dressing wa placed.  Tourniquet wa then desufflated.

Here, a stab wound incision wa made through which the 120 mm Veress needle wa placed and approximately 3 L of carbon dioxide used to create a pneumoperitoneum.  The needle wa removed, the incision minimally enlarged, and the #5 trocar and cannula were placed.  The trocar wa removed and the scope placed confirming a preperitoneal insufflation.,The space wa drained off the insufflated gas and 2 more attempt were made, which failed due to the patient's adiposity.

Clockwise inspection of the pelvis revealed a benign vesicouterine pouch, normal uterus and fundus, normal right tube and ovary.  In the cul-de-sac, there were 3 cluster of 3 to 5 carbon charred type endometrial implant and those more distally in the greatest depth had created puckering and tenting.  The left tube and ovary were normal.  There were no adhesions.  There wa no evidence of acute pelvic inflammatory disease.,The Endoshears and subsequently cautery on a hook were placed and the implant fulgurated.  Pictures were taken for confirmation both before and after the burn.,The carbon char were irrigated and aspirated.  The smoke plume wa removed without difficulty.  Approximately 50 mL of irrigant wa left in the pelvis.  Due to the difficulty in placing and maintaining the Hasson cannula, no attempt were made to view the upper abdominal quadrant, specifically the liver and gallbladder.,The suprapubic cannula wa removed under direct visualization, the pneumo released, the scope removed, the stay suture cut, and the Hasson cannula removed.  The residual suture were then tied together to completely occlude the fascial opening so that there will be no future hernia at this site.

Ligature of right wrist.,TOXICOLOGIC STUDIES ,Blood ethanol - none detected.,Blood drug screen - no drug detected.,CLINOCOPATHOLIGICAL CORRELATION:, Cause of death of this six year old female is asphyxia by strangulation associated with craniocerebral trauma. ,The body of this six year old female wa first seen by me after I wa called to an address XYZ, on 12/26/96. I arrived at the scene approximately 8 PM on 12/26 and entered the house where the decedent's body wa located at approximately 8:20 PM. ,A brief examination of the body disclosed a ligature around the neck and a ligature around the right wrist. Also noted wa a small area of abrasion or contusion below the right ear on the lateral aspect of the right cheek. A prominent dried abrasion wa present on the lower left neck. After examining the body, I left the residence at approximately 8:30 PM. ,EXTERNAL EVIDENCE OF INJURY:, Located just below the right ear at the right angle of the mandible, 1.5 inch below the right external auditory canal is a 3/8 x 1/4 inch area of rust colored abrasion. In the lateral aspect of the left lower eyelid on the inner conjunctival surface is a 1 mm in maximum dimension petechial hemorrhage. Very fine, le than 1 mm petechial hemorrhage are present on the skin of the upper eyelid bilaterally a well a on the lateral left cheek. On everything the left upper eyelid there are much smaller, le than 1 mm petechial hemorrhage located on the conjunctival surface. Possible petechial hemorrhage are also seen on the conjunctival surface of the right upper and lower eyelids, but liver mortis on this side of the face make definite identification difficult. ,A deep ligature furrow encircles the entire neck. The width of the furrow varies from one- eight of an inch to five/sixteenths of an inch and is horizontal in orientation, with little upward deviation. The skin of the anterior neck above and below the ligature furrow contains area of petechial hemorrhage and abrasion encompassing an area measuring approximately 3 x 2 inches. The ligature furrow cross the anterior midline of the neck just below the laryngeal prominence, approximately at the level of the cricoid cartilage. It is almost completely horizontal with slight upward deviation from the horizontal towards the back of the neck. The midline of the furrow mark on the anterior neck is 8 inch below the top of the head. The midline of the furrow mark on the posterior neck is 6.75 inch below the top of the head. ,The area of abrasion and petechial hemorrhage of the skin of the anterior neck includes on the lower left neck, just to the left of the midline, a roughly triangular, parchment-like rust colored abrasion which measure 1.5 inch in length with a maximum width of 0.75 inches. This roughly triangular shaped abrasion is obliquely oriented with the apex superior and lateral. The remainder of the abrasion and petechial hemorrhage of the skin above and below the anterior projection of the ligature furrow are nonpatterned, purple to rust colored, and present in the midline, right, and left area of the anterior neck. The skin just above the ligature furrow along the right side of the neck contains petechial hemorrhage composed of multiple confluent very small petechial hemorrhage a well a several larger petechial hemorrhage measuring up to one-sixteenth and one-eight of an inch in maximum dimension. Similar smaller petechial hemorrhage are present on the skin below the ligature furrow on the left lateral aspect of the neck. Located on the right side of the chin is a three-sixteenths by one-eight of an inch area of superficial abrasion. On the posterior aspect of the right shoulder is a poorly demarcated, very superficial focus of abrasion/contusion which is pale purple in color and measure up to three-quarters by one-half inch in maximum dimension. Several linear aggregate of petechial hemorrhage are present in the anterior left shoulder just above deltopectoral groove. These measure up to one inch in length by one-sixteenth to one-eight of an inch in width. On the left lateral aspect of the lower back, approximately sixteen and one-quarter inch and seventeen and one-half inch below the level of the top of the head are two dried rust colored to slightly purple abrasions. The more superior of the two measure one-eight by one-sixteenth of an inch and the more inferior measure three-sixteenths by one-eight of an inch. There is no surrounding contusion identified. On the posterior aspect of the left lower leg, almost in the midline, approximately 4 inch above the level of the heel are two small scratch-like abrasion which are dried and rust colored. They measure one-sixteenth by le than one- sixteenth of an inch and one-eight by le than one-sixteenth of an inch respectively. ,On the anterior aspect of the perineum, along the edge of closure of the labium majora, is a small amount of dried blood. A similar small amount of dried and semifluid blood is present on the skin of the fourchette and in the vestibule. Inside the vestibule of the vagina and along the distal vaginal wall is reddish hyperemia. This hyperemia is circumferential and perhaps more noticeable on the right side and posteriorly. The hyperemia also appears to extend just inside the vaginal orifice. A 1 cm red-purple area of abrasion is located on the right posterolateral area of the 1 x 1 cm hymeneal orifice. The hymen itself is represented by a rim of mucosal tissue extending clockwise between the 2 and 10:00 positions. The area of abrasion is present at approximately the 7:00 position and appears to involve the hymen and distal right lateral vaginal wall and possibly the area anterior to the hymen. On the right labium majora is a very faint area of violent discoloration measuring approximately one inch by three-eighths of an inch. Incision into the underlying subcutaneous tissue discloses no hemorrhage. A minimal amount of semiliquid thin watery red fluid is present in the vaginal vault. No recent or remote anal or other perineal trauma is identified. ,REMAINDER OF EXTERNAL EXAMINATION:, The unembalmed, well developed and well nourished Caucasian female body measure 47 inch in length and weighs an estimated 45 pounds. ,No scalp trauma is identified.

She also ha concern with regard to the external appearance of her nose and is requesting change in the external appearance of her nose.  From her functional standpoint, she ha severe left-sided nasal septal deviation with compensatory inferior turbinate hypertrophy.  From the aesthetic standpoint, the nose is over projected, lack rotation, and ha a large dorsal hump.  First we are going to straighten the nasal septum and reduce the size of the turbinate and then we will also take down the hump, rotate the tip of the nose, and de-project the nasal tip.  I explained to her the risks, benefits, alternatives, and complication for postsurgical procedure.  She had her question asked and answered and requested that we proceed with surgery a outlined above.,PROCEDURE DETAILS: , The patient wa taken to the operating room and placed in supine position.  The appropriate level of general endotracheal anesthesia wa induced.  The face, head, and neck were sterilely prepped and draped.  The nose wa anesthetized and vasoconstricted in the usual fashion.  Procedure began with a left hemitransfixion incision, which wa brought down into the left intercartilaginous incision.  Right intercartilaginous incision wa also made and the dorsum of the nose wa elevated in the submucoperichondrial and subperiosteal plane.  Intact bilateral septomucoperichondrial flap were elevated and a severe left-sided nasal septal deviation wa corrected by detachment of the caudal nasal septum from the maxillary crest in a swinging door fashion and placing it back into the midline.  Posterior vomerine spur wa divided superiorly and inferiorly and a large spur wa removed.  Anterior and inferior one-third of each inferior turbinate wa clamped, cut, and resected.  The upper lateral cartilage were divided from their attachment to the dorsal nasal septum and the cartilaginous septum wa lowered by approximately 2 mm.  The bony hump of the nose wa lowered with a straight osteotome by 4 mm.  Fading medial osteotomy were carried out and lateral osteotomy were then created in order to narrow the bony width of the nose.  The tip of the nose wa then addressed via a retrograde dissection and removal of cephalic caudal semicircle cartilage medially at the tip.  The caudal septum wa shortened by 2 mm in an angle in order to enhance rotation.  Medial crural footplate were reattached to the caudal nasal septum with a projection rotation control suture of #3-0 chromic.  The upper lateral cartilage were rejoined to the dorsal septum with a #4-0 plain gut suture.  No middle valve or bone graft were necessary.  Intact mucoperichondrial flap were closed with 4-0 plain gut suture and Doyle nasal splint were placed on either side of the nasal septum.  The middle meatus wa filled with Surgicel and Cortisporin otic and external Denver splint wa applied with sterile tape and Mastisol.  Excellent aesthetic and functional result were thus obtained and the patient wa awakened in the operating room, taken to the recovery room in good condition. ",2.0

At this time, she desire attempted surgical correction.  The risk versus benefit of the procedure have been discussed with the patient in detail by Dr. X and the consent is available on the chart for review.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After IV wa established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient wa taken to the operating room via cart and placed on the operative table in supine position and a safety strap wa placed across her waist for her protection.  Copious amount of Webril were applied about the right ankle and a pneumatic ankle tourniquet wa placed over the Webril.,After adequate IV sedation wa administered by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 15 cc of 1:1 mixture of 0.5% Marcaine plain and 1% Lidocaine plain wa injected into the foot in a standard Mayo block fashion.  The foot wa elevated off the table.  Esmarch bandage were used to exsanguinate the right foot.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet wa elevated to 250 mmHg.  The foot wa lowered in the operative field and the sterile stockinet wa reflected.  A sterile Betadine wa wiped away with a wet and dry sponge and one toothpick wa used to test anesthesia, which wa found to be adequate.  Attention wa directed to the first metatarsophalangeal joint, which wa found to be contracted, laterally deviated, and had decreased range of motion.  A #10 blade wa used to make a 4 cm dorsolinear incision.  A #15 blade wa used to deepen the incision through the subcutaneous layer.  All superficial subcutaneous vessel were ligated with electrocautery.  Next, a linear capsular incision wa made down the bone with a #15 blade.  The capsule wa elevated medially and laterally off the metatarsal head and the metatarsal head wa delivered into the wound.  A hypertrophic medial eminence wa resected with a sagittal saw taking care not to strike the head.  The medial plantar aspect of the metatarsal head had some erosive change and eburnation.  Next, a 0.45 inch Kirschner wire wa placed with some access guide slightly plantar flexing the metatarsal taking care not to shorten it.  A sagittal saw wa used to make a long-arm Austin osteotomy in the usual fashion.  Standard lateral release wa also performed a well a a lateral capsulotomy freeing the fibular sesamoid complex.,The capital head wa shifted laterally and impacted on the residual metatarsal head.  Nice correction wa achieved and excellent bone to bone contact wa achieved.  The bone stock wa slightly decreased, but adequate.  Next, a 0.45 inch Kirschner wire wa used to temporarily fixate the metatarsal capital fragment.  A 2.7 x 18 mm Synthes cortical screw wa thrown using standard AO technique.  Excellent rigid fixation wa achieved.  A second 2.0 x 80 mm Synthes fully threaded cortical screw wa also thrown using standard AO technique at the proximal aspect of the metatarsal head.  Again, an excellent rigid fixation wa obtained and the screw were tight.  The temporary fixation wa removed.  A medial overhanging bone wa resected with a sagittal saw.  The foot wa loaded and the hallux wa found to have an interphalangeus deformity present.,A sagittal saw wa used to make a proximal cut in approximately 1 cm dorsal to the base of the proximal phalanx, leaving a lateral intact cortical hinge.  A distal cut parallel with the nail base wa performed and a standard proximal Akin osteotomy wa done.,After the wedge bone wa removed, the saw blade wa reinserted and used to tether the osteotomy with counter-pressure used to close down the osteotomy.  A #15 drill blade wa used to drill two converging hole on the medial aspect of the bone.  A #28 gauge monofilament wire wa inserted loop to loop and pulled through the bone.  The monofilament wire wa twisted down and tapped into the distal drill hole.  The foot wa loaded again and the toe had an excellent cosmetic straight appearance and the range of motion of the first metatarsophalangeal joint wa then improved.  Next, reciprocating rasp were used to smooth all bony surfaces.  Copious amount of sterile saline wa used to flush the joint.  Next, a #3-0 Vicryl wa used to reapproximate the capsular periosteal tissue layer.  Next, #4-0 Vicryl wa used to close the subcutaneous layer.  #5-0 Vicryl wa used to the close the subcuticular layer in a running fashion.  Next, 1 cc of dexamethasone phosphate wa then instilled in the joint.  The Steri-Strips were applied followed by standard postoperative dressing consisting of Owen silk, 4 x 4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet wa released and immediate hyperemic flush wa noted to the digits.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.

Apparently while he wa playing basketball on 12/22/2007 when he had gone up for a jump, he felt a pop in his knee.  The patient wa seen at an outside facility where he wa splinted and subsequently referred to Children's for definitive care.  Radiographs confirmed comminuted tibial tubercle avulsion fracture with patella alta.  Surgery is recommended to the grandmother and subsequently to the father by phone.  Surgery would consist of open reduction and internal fixation with subsequent need for later hardware removal.  Risks of surgery include the risk of  anesthesia, infection, bleeding, change on sensation in most of the extremity, hardware failure, need for later hardware removal, failure to restore extensor mechanism tension, and need for postoperative rehab.  All question were answered, and father and grandmother agreed to the above plan.,PROCEDURE: , The patient wa taken to the operating and placed supine on the operating table.  General anesthesia wa then administered.  The patient wa given Ancef preoperatively.  A nonsterile tourniquet wa placed on the upper aspect of the patient's left thigh.  The patient's extremity wa then prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  Midline incision wa marked on the skin extending from the tibial tubercle proximally and extremity wrapped in Esmarch.  Finally, the patient had tourniquet that turned in 75 mmHg.  Esmarch wa then removed.  The incision wa then made.  The patient had significant  tearing of the posterior retinaculum medially with proximal migration of the tibial tubercle which wa located in the joint there wa a significant comminution and intraarticular involvement.  We were able to see the underside of the anterior horn of both medial and lateral meniscus.  The intraarticular cartilage wa restored using two 45 K-wires.  Final position wa checked via fluoroscopy and the corner were buried in the cartilage.  There wa a large free floating metaphyseal piece that included part of proximal tibial physis.  This wa placed back in an anatomic location and fixed using a 45 cortical screw with a washer.  The avulsed fragment with the patellar tendon wa then fixed distally to this area using a 6.5, 60 mm cancellous screw with a washer.  The cortical screw did not provide good compression and fixation at this distal fragment.  Retinaculum wa repaired using 0 Vicryl suture a best a possible.

Lymph node biopsy, level 7 subcarinal showing (5) lymph node with anthracosis and no metastatic tumor.,COMMENT:  ,The morphology of the tumor seen in both lobe is similar and we feel that the smaller tumor involving the right lower lobe is most likely secondary to transbronchial spread from the main tumor involving the right upper lobe.  This suggestion is supported by the fact that no obvious vascular or lymphatic invasion is demonstrated and adjacent to the smaller tumor, there is isolated nest of tumor cell within the air spaces.  Furthermore, immunoperoxidase stain for Ck-7, CK-20 and TTF are performed on both the right lower and right upper lobe nodule.  The immunohistochemical result confirm the lung origin of both tumor and we feel that the tumor involving the right lower lobe is due to transbronchial spread from the larger tumor nodule involving the right upper lobe., ",1.0

The mom understood all this and wished to proceed.,PROCEDURE: , The patient wa taken to the operating room and underwent general anesthetic.  She then had line placed, and wa then placed in a prone position.  Monitoring wa then set up, and it wa then noted that we could not obtain motor-evoked potentials.  The SSEPs were clear and were compatible with the preoperative, but no preoperative motor had been done, and there wa a concern that possibly this could be from the result of the positioning.  It wa then determined at that time, that we would go ahead and proceed to wake her up, and make sure she could move her feet.  She wa then lightened under anesthesia, and she could indeed dorsiflex and plantarflex her feet, so therefore, it wa determined to go ahead and proceed with only monitoring with the SSEPs.,The patient after being prepped and draped sterilely, a midline incision wa made, and dissection wa carried down.  The dissection utilized a combination of hand instrument and electrocautery and dissected out along the lamina and up to the transverse processes.  This occurred from T2-L2.  Fluoroscopy wa brought in to verify position and levels.  Once this wa done, and all bleeding wa controlled, retractor were then placed.  Attention wa then turned towards placing screw first on the left side.  Lumbar screw were placed at the junction of the transverse process and the facet under fluoroscopic guidance.  The area wa opened with a high speed burr, and then the track wa defined with a blunt probe, and a ball-tipped feeler wa then utilized to verify all wall were intact.  They were then tapped, and then screw were then placed.  This technique wa used at L1 and L2, both the right and left.  At T12, a direct straight-ahead technique wa utilized, where the facet wa removed, and then the position wa chosen under the fluoroscopy, and then it wa spurred, the track wa defined and then probed and tapped, and it wa felt to be in good position.  Two screws, in the right and left were placed at T12 a well, reduction screw on the left.  The same technique wa used for T11, where right and left screw were placed a well a T10 on the left.  At T9, a screw wa placed on the left, and this wa a reduction screw.  On the left at T8, a screw could not be placed due to the dysmorphic nature of the pedicle.  It wa not felt to be intact; therefore, a screw wa left out of this.  On the right, a thoracic screw wa placed a well a at 7 and 6.  This wa the dysmorphic portion of this.  Screws were attempted to be placed up, they could not be placed, so attention wa then turned towards placing pedicle hooks.  Pedicle hook were done by first making a box out of the pedicle, removing the complete pedicle, feeling the undersurface of the pedicle with a probe, and then seating the hook.  Upgoing pedicle hook were placed at T3, T4, and T5.  A downgoing laminar hook wa placed at the T7 level.  Screws had been placed at T6 and T7 on the right.  An upgoing pedicle hook wa also placed at T3 on the right, and then, downgoing laminar hook were placed at T2.  This wa done by first using a transverse process, lamina finder to go around the transverse process and then ___________ laminar hooks.  Once all hook were in place, spinal osteotomy were performed at T7-T8 and T8-T9.  This wa the level of the kyphosis, to bring her back out of her kyphoscoliosis.  First the ligamentum flavum wa resected using a large Kerrisons.  Next, the laminotomy wa performed, and then a Kerrison wa used to remove the ligamentum flavum at the level of the facet.  Once this wa accomplished, a laminotomy wa performed by removing more of the lamina, and to create a small wedge that could be closed down later to correct the kyphosis.  This wa then brought out with resection of bone out to the foramen, doing a foraminotomy to free up the foramen on both sides.  This wa done also between the T8-T9.  Once this wa completed, Gelfoam wa then placed.  Next, we observed, and measured and contoured.  The rod were then seated on the left, and then a derotation maneuver wa performed.  Hooks had come loose, so the rod wa removed on the left.  The hook were then replaced, and the rod wa reseated.  Again, it wa derotated to give excellent correction.  Hooks were then well seated underneath, and therefore, they were then locked.  A second rod wa then chosen on the right, and wa measured, contoured, and then seated.  Next, once this wa done, the rod were locked in the midsubstance, and then the downgoing pedicle hook, which had been placed at T7 wa then helped to compress T8 a wa the pedicle screw, and then this compressed the osteotomy site quite nicely.  Next, distraction wa then utilized to further correct at the spine, and to correct on the left, the left concave curve, which gave excellent correction.  On the right, compression wa used to bring it down, and then, in the lower lumbar areas, distraction and compression were used to level out L2.  Once this wa done, all screw were tightened.  Fluoroscopy wa then brought in to verify L1 wa level, and the first rib were also level, and it gave a nice balanced spine.  Everything wa copiously irrigated, ___________.  Next, a wake-up test wa performed, and the patient wa then noted to flex and extend the knee a well a dorsiflex and plantar flex both the feet.  The patient wa then again sedated and brought back under general anesthesia.  Next, a high-speed burr wa used for decortication.  After final tightening had been accomplished, and then allograft bone and autograft bone were mixed together with 10 mL of iliac crest aspirate and were placed into the wound.  The open canal area had been protected with Gelfoam.  Once this wa accomplished, the deep fascia wa closed with multiple figure-of-eight #1's, oversewn with a running #1, _________ were then placed in the subcutaneous space which were then closed with 3-0 Vicryl, and then the skin wa closed with 3-0 Monocryl and Dermabond.  Sterile dressing wa applied.  Drains had been placed in the subcutaneous layer x2.  The patient during the case had no change in the SSEPs, had a normal wake-up test, and had received Ancef and clindamycin during the case.  She wa taken from the operating room in good condition.

This is an enhancing lesion suspicious for renal cell carcinoma versus oncocytoma.  I discussed a variety of option with her, and she opted to proceed with a laparoscopic right radical nephrectomy.  All question were answered, and she wished to proceed with surgery a planned.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After acquisition of appropriate written and informed consent and administration of perioperative antibiotics, the patient wa taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table.  Note that, sequential compression device were placed on both lower extremity and were activated per induction of anesthesia.  After institution of adequate general anesthetic via the endotracheal route, she wa placed into the right anterior flank position with the right side elevated in a roll and the right arm across her chest.  All pressure point were carefully padded, and she wa securely taped to the table to prevent shifting during the procedure.  Her abdomen wa then prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion after placing a 16-French Foley catheter per urethra to gravity drainage.  The abdomen wa insufflated in the right outer quadrant.  Note that, the patient had had previous surgery which complicated access somewhat and that she had a previous hysterectomy.  The abdomen wa insufflated into the right lateral abdomen with Veress needle to 50 mm of pressure without incident.  We then placed a 10/12 Visiport trocar approximately 7 cm lateral to the umbilicus.  Once this had entered into the peritoneal cavity without incident, the remaining trocars were all placed.  Under direct laparoscopic visualization, we placed three additional trocars; an 11-mm screw-type trocar in the umbilicus, a 6-mm screw-type trocar in the upper midline approximately 7 cm above the umbilicus, and 10/12 trocar in the lower midline about 7 cm below the umbilicus within and over the old hysterectomy scar.  There were some adhesion of omentum to the underside of that scar, and these were taken down sharply using laparoscopic scissors.,We began nephrectomy procedure by reflecting the right colon, by incising the white line of Toldt.  This exposed the retroperitoneum on the right side.  The duodenum wa identified and reflected medially in a Kocher maneuver using sharp dissection only.  We then identified the ureter and gonadal vein in the retroperitoneum.  The gonadal vein wa left down along the vena cava, and the plane underneath the ureter wa elevated and this plane wa carried up towards the renal hilum.  Sequential packet of tissue were taken using primarily the LigaSure Atlas device.  Once we got to the renal hilum, it became apparent that this patient had two set of renal artery and veins.  We proceeded then and skeletonized the structure into four individual packets.  We then proceeded to perform the upper pole dissection and developing the plane above the kidney and between the kidney and adrenal gland.  The adrenal wa spared during this procedure.  There wa no contiguous connection between the renal mass and a right adrenal gland.  This plane of dissection wa taken down primarily using the LigaSure device.  We then sequentially took the four vessel going to the kidney initially taking two renal artery with the endo GI stapler and then to renal vein again with endo GI stapler sequential flaring.  Once this wa completed, the kidney wa free except for it attachment to the ureter and lateral attachments.  The lateral attachment of the kidney were taken down using the LigaSure Atlas device, and then the ureter wa doubly clipped and transected.  The kidney wa then freed within the retroperitoneum.  A 50-mm EndoCatch bag wa introduced through the lower most trocar site, and the kidney wa placed into this bag for subsequent extraction.  We extended the lower most trocar site approximately 6 cm to facilitate extraction.  The kidney wa removed and passed off the table a a specimen for pathology.  This wa bivalved by pathology, and we reviewed the specimen. ",2.0

General anesthesia wa accomplished.  A 16-French Foley wa placed using aseptic technique.  The patient wa then placed on the operating table prone.  His right flank wa prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  At this point, contrast wa injected through his existing nephrostomy tube and there wa no continuity with the collecting system and it wa removed.  The 5-French Pollack catheter wa used to pas a 0.38 super-stiff Amplatz wire.  The wire would not go down the ureter.  Multiple attempt were made using Pollack catheter and Cobra catheter and attempt were made to dilate the track, both with rigid dilator and the balloon dilator and access could not be obtained.  After multiple attempts, access wa lost.  At this point, the tube were left out of the kidney and sterile dressing were applied.  The patient wa then placed on another operating table supine.  His genitalia were prepped and draped after removing his Foley catheter.  Flexible cystoscopy wa performed and the right orifice identified, which wa edematous and erythematous.  The wire wa passed up to kidney and a 5-French Pollack catheter wa then passed over to after the removing the scope.  The wire wa removed.  Contrast injection with good placement in the collecting system.  The wire wa replaced.  The Pollack catheter removed and 6-French variable length double-J stent wa inserted using fluoroscopic guidance.  The wire wa removed leaving the double-J stent in good position.  _______ 16-French Foley wa reinserted and connected to close drains.,Procedure wa terminated at this point and had been well tolerated.

Since that time, the patient ha developed significant calcaneal valgus deformity with significant pain.  Radiographs confirmed collapse of the spinal arch, a well a valgus position of the foot.  Given the patient's symptoms, surgery is recommended for calcaneal osteotomy and Achilles lengthening.  Risks and benefit of surgery were discussed with the mother.  Risks of surgery include risk of anesthesia; infection; bleeding; change in sensation in most of extremity; hardware failure; need for later hardware removal; possible nonunion; possible failure to correct all the deformity; and need for other surgical procedures.  The patient will need to be strict nonweightbearing for at least 6 week and wear a brace for up to 6 months.  All question were answered and parent agreed to the above surgical plan.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient wa taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table.  General anesthesia wa then administered.  The patient received Ancef preoperatively.  A bump wa placed underneath the left buttock.  A nonsterile tourniquet wa placed on the upper aspect of the left thigh.  The extremity wa then prepped and draped in a standard surgical fashion.  The patient had a previous incision along the calcaneocuboid lateral part of the foot.  This wa marked and extended proximally through the Achilles tendon.  Extremity wa wrapped in Esmarch.  Tourniquet inflation wa noted to be 250 mmHg.  Decision wa then made to protect the sural nerve.  There wa one sensory nervous branch that did cross the field though it wa subsequently sharply ligated because it wa in the way.  Dissection wa carried down to Achilles tendon, which wa subsequently de-lengthened with the distal half performed down the lateral thigh.  Proximal end wa tacked with an 0 Ethibond suture and subsequently repaired end-on-end at length with the heel in neutral.  Dissection wa then carried on the lateral border of the foot with identification of the peroneal longus and valgus tendons, which were removed from the sheath and retracted dorsally.  At this time, we also noted that calcaneocuboid joint appeared to be fused.  The area between the anterior and middle facet were plicated on fluoroscopy for planned osteotomy.  This wa performed with a saw.  After a partial plantar fasciotomy wa performed, this wa released off an abductor digiti minimi.  The osteotomy wa completed with an osteotome and distracted with the lamina spreader.  A tricortical allograft wa then shaped and subsequently impacted into this area.  Final positioning wa checked with multiple view of fluoroscopy.  It wa subsequently fixed using a 0.94 K-wire and drilled from the heel anteriorly.  A pin wa subsequently bent and cut short at the level of the skin.  The wound wa then irrigated with normal saline.  The Achilles wa repaired with this tie.  Please note during the case, it wa noted the patient had continued significant stiffness despite the Achilles lengthening.  A posterior capsulotomy of the tibiotalar and subtalar joint were performed with increased 10 degree of dorsiflexion.  Wound wa then closed using #2-0 Vicryl and #4-0 Monocryl.  The surgical field wa irrigated with 0.25% Marcaine and subsequently injected with more Marcaine at the end of the case.  The wound wa clean and dry and dressed with Steri-Strips and Xeroform.  Skin wa dressed with Xeroform and 4 x 4's.  Everything wa wrapped with 4 x 4's in sterile Webril.  The tourniquet wa released after 69 minutes.

Following the induction of satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient wa prepared for surgery.  A shoulder roll wa placed between the scapula and the head wa rested on a doughnut in a slightly extended position.  A preoperative x-ray wa obtained to identify the operative level and neck position.  An incision wa marked at the C4-C5 level on the right side.  The incision wa opened with #10 blade knife.  Dissection wa carried down through subcutaneous tissue using Bovie electrocautery.  The platysma muscle wa divided with the cautery and mobilized rostrally and caudally.  The anterior border of sternocleidomastoid muscle wa then dissected rostrally and caudally with sharp and blunt dissection.  The avascular plane wa then entered and dissection wa carried bluntly down to the anterior cervical fascia.  This wa opened with scissors and dissected rostrally and caudally with the peanut dissectors.  The operative level wa confirmed with an intraoperative x-ray.  The longus colli muscle were mobilized bilaterally using bipolar electrocautery and periosteal elevator.  The anterior longitudinal ligament wa then taken down with the insulated Bovie electrocautery tip exposing the vertebral body of C4 and C5.  Self-retaining retractor wa placed in submuscular position, and distraction pin were placed in the vertebral body of C4 and C5, and distraction wa instituted.  We then incise the annulus of C4-C5 and a discectomy wa now carried out using pituitary rongeurs and straight and angled curettes.  Operating microscope wa draped and brought into play.  Dissection wa carried down through the disc space to the posterior aspect of the disc space removing the disc with the angled curette a we went.  We now use the diamond bit to thin the posterior bone spur and osteophyte at the uncovertebral joint bilaterally.  Bone wa then removed with 2 mm Kerrison punch and then we were able to traverse the posterior longitudinal ligament and this ligament wa now removed in a piecemeal fashion with a 2 mm Kerrison punch.  There wa a transligamentous disc herniation, which wa removed during this process.

There did appear to be old suture in a portion of the bowel most likely from a prior procedure.,INDICATIONS: , This patient is a 45-year-old African-American gravida7, para3-0-0-3, who is here for definitive treatment of chronic pelvic pain with a history of endometriosis.  She did have a laparoscopic ablation of endometriosis on a laparoscopy and also ha a history of right salpingo-oophorectomy.  She ha tried Lupron and did stop secondary to the side effects.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After informed consent wa obtained in layman's terms, the patient wa taken back to the Operating Suite and placed under general anesthesia.  She wa then prepped and draped in the sterile fashion and placed in the dorsal supine position.  An indwelling Foley catheter wa placed.  With the skin knife, an incision wa made removing the old cicatrix.  A Bovie wa used to carry the tissue through to the underlying layer of the fascia which wa incised in the midline and extended with the Bovie.  The rectus muscle wa then sharply and bluntly dissected off the superior aspect of the rectus fascia in the superior a well a the inferior aspect using the Bovie.  The rectus muscle wa then separated in the midline using a hemostat and the peritoneum wa entered bluntly.  The peritoneal incision wa then extended superiorly and inferiorly with Metzenbaum scissors with careful visualization of the bladder.  At this point, the intraabdominal cavity wa manually explored and the above finding were noted.  A Lahey clamp wa then placed on the fundus of the uterus and the uterus wa brought to the surgical field.  The bowel wa then packed with moist laparotomy sponges.  Prior to this, the filmy adhesion leftover were taken down.  At this point, the left round ligament wa identified, grasped with two hemostats, transected, and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl.  At this point, the broad ligament wa dissected down and the lost portion of the bladder flap wa created.  The posterior aspect of the peritoneum wa also dissected.  At this point, the infundibulopelvic ligament wa isolated and three tie of #0 Vicryl wa used to isolate the pedicle.  Two hemostat were then placed across the pedicle and this wa transected with the scalpel.  This wa then suture ligated in Heaney fashion.  The right round ligament wa then identified and in the similar fashion, two hemostat were placed across the round ligament and using the Mayo scissors the round ligament wa transected and dissected down the broad ligament to create the bladder flap anteriorly a well a dissect the posterior peritoneum and isolate the round ligament.  This wa then ligated with three tie of #0 Vicryl.  Also incorporated in this wa the remnant from the previous right salpingo-oophorectomy.  At this point, the bladder flap wa further created with sharp dissection a well a the moist Ray-Tech to push the bladder down off the anterior portion of the cervix.,The left uterine artery wa then skeletonized and a straight Heaney wa placed.  In a similar fashion, the contralateral uterine artery wa skeletonized and straight Heaney clamp wa placed.  These ligament bilaterally were transected and suture ligated in a left Heaney stitch.  At this point, curved Masterson wa used to incorporate the cardinal ligament complex, thus wa transected and suture ligated.  Straight Masterson wa then used to incorporate the uterosacrals bilaterally and this wa also transected and suture ligated.  Prior to ligating the uterine arteries, the uterosacral artery were tagged bilaterally with #0 Vicryl.  At this point, the roticulator wa placed across the vaginal cuff and snug underneath the entire cervix.  The roticulator wa then clamped and removed and the staple line wa in place.  This wa found to be hemostatic.  A suture wa then placed through each cuff angle bilaterally and cardinal ligament complex wa found to be fixed to each apex bilaterally.  At this point, McCall culdoplasty wa performed with an #0 Vicryl incorporating each uterosacral a well a the posterior peritoneum.  There did appear to be good support on palpation.  Prior to this, the specimen wa handed off and sent to pathology.  At this point, there did appear to be small amount of oozing at the right peritoneum.  Hemostasis wa obtained using a #0 Vicryl in two single stitches.  Good hemostasis wa then obtained on the cuff a well a the pedicles.  Copious irrigation wa performed at this point with lactate Ringers.  The round ligament were then incorporated into the cuff bilaterally.  Again, copious amount of irrigation wa performed and good hemostasis wa obtained.  At this point, the peritoneum wa reapproximated in a single interrupted stitch on the left and right lateral aspect to cover each pedicle bilaterally.  At this point, the bowel packing a well a moist Ray-Tech wa removed and while re-approximating the bowel it wa noted that there were multiple interloop bowel adhesion which were taken down using the Metzenbaum scissors with good visualization of the underlying bowel.  Good hemostasis wa obtained of these site a well.  The sigmoid colon wa then returned to it anatomic position and the omentum a well.  The rectus muscle wa then reapproximated with two interrupted suture of #2-0 Vicryl.  The fascia wa then reapproximated with #0 Vicryl in a running fashion from lateral to medial meeting in the midline.  The Scarpa's fascia wa then closed with #3-0 plain in a running suture.  The skin wa then re-approximated with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular closure.  This wa dressed with an Op-Site.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The sponge, lap, and needle were correct x2.  After the procedure, the patient wa extubated and brought out of general anesthesia.  She will go to the floor where she will be followed postoperatively in the hospital. ",2.0

Thoracic epidural.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risk and benefit of the aforementioned procedure, the patient wa taken to the operating room, and general endotracheal anesthesia wa administered with a dual-lumen tube.  Next, the patient wa placed in the left lateral decubitus position, and his right chest wa prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  We used a #10-blade scalpel to make an incision in the skin approximately 1 fingerbreadth below the angle of the scapula.  Dissection wa carried down in a muscle-sparing fashion using Bovie electrocautery.  The 5th rib wa counted, and the 6th interspace wa entered.  The lung wa deflated.  We identified the major fissure.  We then began by freeing up the inferior pulmonary ligament, which wa done with Bovie electrocautery.  Next, we used Bovie electrocautery to dissect the pleura off the lung.  The pulmonary artery branch to the right upper lobe of the lung were identified.  Of note wa the fact that there wa a visible, approximately 4 x 4-cm mass in the right upper lobe of the lung without any other metastatic disease palpable.  As mentioned, a combination of Bovie electrocautery and sharp dissection wa used to identify the pulmonary artery branch to the right upper lobe of the lung.  Next, we began by ligating the pulmonary artery branch of the right upper lobe of the lung.  This wa done with suture ligature in combination with clips.  After taking the pulmonary artery branch of the right upper lobe of the lung, we used a combination of blunt dissection and sharp dissection with Metzenbaum scissors to separate out the pulmonary vein branch of the right upper lobe of the lung.  This likewise wa ligated with a 0 silk.  It wa stick-tied with a 2-0 silk.  It wa then divided.  Next we dissected out the bronchial branch to the right upper lobe of the lung.  A curved Glover wa placed around the bronchus.  Next a TA-30 stapler wa fired across the bronchus.  The bronchus wa divided with a #10-blade scalpel.  The specimen wa handed off.  We next performed a mediastinal lymph node dissection.  Clips were applied to the base of the feeding vessel to the lymph nodes.  We inspected for any sign of bleeding.  There wa minimal bleeding.  We placed a #32-French anterior chest tube, and a #32-French posterior chest tube.  The rib space wa closed with #2 Vicryl in an interrupted figure-of-eight fashion.  A flat Jackson-Pratt drain, #10 in size, wa placed in the subcutaneous flap.  The muscle layer wa closed with a combination of 2-0 Vicryl followed by 2-0 Vicryl, followed by 4-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular fashion.  Sterile dressing wa applied.  The instrument and sponge count wa correct at the end of the case.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and wa transferred to the PACU in good condition. ",2.0

The left ankle wa covered with cast padding and an 18-inch ankle tourniquet wa placed around the left ankle and set at 250 mmHg.  The left foot wa then prepped, scrubbed, and draped in normal sterile technique.  The left ankle tourniquet wa then inflated.  Attention wa then directed on the dorsal aspect of the first left metatarsal shaft where an 8-cm linear incision wa placed directly parallel and medial to the course of the extensor hallucis longus tendon.  The incision extended from the base of the first left metatarsal all the way to the first left metatarsophalangeal joint.  The incision wa deepened through subcutaneous tissues.  All the bleeder were identified, cut, clamped, and cauterized.  The incision wa deepened to the level of the periosteum of the first left metatarsal.  All the tendinous neurovascular structure were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved.  Using sharp and dull dissection, the periosteal tissue were mobilized from their attachment on the first left metatarsal shaft.  Dissection wa carried down to the level of the lose screw fixation and the two screw were identified and removed intact.  The screw were sent to pathology for examination.  The nonunion wa also identified closer to the base of the first left metatarsal and using the sagittal saw the nonunion and some of the healthy tissue on both end of the previous osteotomy were resected and sent to pathology for identification.  The remaining two end of the previous osteotomy were then fenestrated with the use of a 0.045 Kirschner wire to induce bleeding.  The corticocancellous bone graft wa prepped according to the instruction in saline for at least 60 minute and then interposed in the previous area of the osteotomy.  Provisional fixation with K-wires wa achieved and also correction of the bunion deformity of the first left metatarsophalangeal joint wa also accomplished.  The bone graft wa then stabilized with the use of a T-type prebent plate with the use of fixed screw that were inserted using AO technique through the plate and the shaft of the first left metatarsal and compressed appropriately the graft.

The patient wa brought to the preoperative holding area, where the operative left eye wa marked.  He wa brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  EKG lead were placed.  General anesthesia wa induced.  The left ocular surface and periorbital skin were disinfected and draped in the standard fashion for eye surgery after a shield and tape were placed over the unoperated right eye.  A lid speculum wa placed.  The posterior segment infusion wa placed by the vitreoretinal service.  Peritomy wa performed at the 3 and 9 o'clock limbal positions.  A large Flieringa ring wa then sutured to the conjunctival surface using 8-0 silk suture tied in an interrupted fashion.  The cornea wa then measured and wa found to accommodate a 7.5-mm trephine.  The center of the cornea wa marked.  The keratoprosthesis wa identified.,A 7.5-mm trephine blade wa then used to incise the anterior corneal surface.  This wa done after a paracentesis wa placed at the 1 o'clock position and viscoelastic wa used to dissect peripheral anterior synechiae.  Once the synechiae were freed, the above-mentioned trephination of the anterior cornea wa performed.  Corneoscleral scissors were then used to excise completely the central cornea.  The keratoprosthesis wa placed in position and wa sutured with six interrupted 8-0 silk sutures.  This wa done without difficulty.  At this point, the case wa turned over to the vitreoretinal team, which will dictate under a separate note.  At the conclusion of the vitreoretinal procedure, the patient wa brought under the care of the cornea service.  The 9-0 Prolene suture double armed were then placed on each lens haptic loop.  The keratoprosthesis wa removed.  Prior to this removal, scleral flap were made, partial thickness at the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock position underneath the peritomies.  Wet-field cautery also wa performed to achieve hemostasis.  The leading hepatic suture were then passed through the bed of the scleral flap.  These were drawn out of the eye and then used to draw the trailing hepatic into the posterior segment of the eye followed by the optic.  The trailing hepatic wa then placed into the posterior segment of the eye a well.  The trailing haptic suture were then placed through the opposite scleral flap bed and were withdrawn.  These were tied securely into position with the IOL nicely centered.  At this point, the donor cornea punched at 8.25 mm wa then brought into the field.  This wa secured with four cardinal sutures.  The corneal button wa then sutured in place using a 16-bite 10-0 nylon running suture.  The knot wa secured and buried after adequate tension wa adjusted.  The corneal graft wa watertight.  Attention wa then turned back to the IOL sutures, which were locked into position.  The end were trimmed.  The flap were secured with single 10-0 nylon suture to the apex, and the knot were buried.  At this point, the case wa then turned back over to the vitreoretinal service for further completion of the retinal procedure.  The patient tolerated the corneal portion of the surgery well and wa turned over to the retina service in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well.  No complication were noted.  The attending surgeon, Dr. X, performed the entire procedure.  No complication of the procedure were noted.  The intraocular lens wa selected from preoperative calculations.

The neck wa prepped and draped in the usual fashion for anterior discectomy and fusion.  An incision wa made midline to the anterior body of the sternocleidomastoid at C5-C6 level.  The skin, subcutaneous tissue, and platysma muscle wa divided exposing the carotid sheath, which wa retracted laterally.  Trachea and esophagus were retracted medially.  After placing the self-retaining retractor with the longus colli muscle having been dissected away from the vertebral body at C5 and C6 and confirming our position with intraoperative x-rays, we then proceeded with the discectomy.,We then cleaned out the disc at C5-C6 after incising the annulus fibrosis.  We cleaned out the disc with a combination of angled and straight pituitary rongeurs and curettes, and the next step wa to clean out the disc space totally.  With this having been done, we then turned our attention with the operating microscope to the osteophytes.  We drilled off the vertebral osteophyte at C5-C6, a well a the uncovertebral osteophytes.  This wa removed along with the posterior longitudinal ligament.  After we had done this, the dural sac wa opposed very nicely and both C6 nerve root were thoroughly decompressed.  The next step after the decompression of the thecal sac and both C6 nerve root wa the fusion.  We observed that there wa a ____________ in the posterior longitudinal ligament.  There wa a free fragment disc, which had broken through the posterior longitudinal ligament just to the right of midline.,The next step wa to obtain the bone from the back bone, using cortical cancellous graft 10 mm in size after we had estimated the size.  That wa secured into place with distraction being applied on the vertebral body using vertebral body distractor.,After we had tapped in the bone plug, we then removed the distraction and the bone plug wa fitting nicely.,We then use the Aesculap cervical titanium instrumentation with the 16-mm screws.  After securing the C5-C6 disc with four screw and titanium plate, x-ray showed good alignment of the spine, good placement of the bone graft, and after x-ray showed excellent position of the bone graft and instrumentation, we then placed in a Jackson-Pratt drain in the prevertebral space brought out through a separate incision.

Although, the tumor wa near obstructing, she wa not having symptom and in fact wa having normal bowel movements.,A lengthy discussion wa held with the patient regarding her diagnosis and prognosis.  Firstly, she ha a good prognosis for being cured without adjuvant therapy.  I would consider her borderline for chemotherapy given her young age.  Referring to the database that had been online, she ha a 13% chance of relapse in the next five years, and with aggressive chemotherapy (X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) platinum-based), this would be reduced to an 8% risk of relapse with a 5% benefit.  Chemotherapy with 5-FU based regimen would have a smaller benefit of around 2.5%.,Plan wa made to allow her to recuperate and then meet with her and her husband to discus the pro and con of adjuvant chemotherapy including what regimen she could consider including the side effects.  We did not review all that information today.,She ha a family history of early colon cancer.  Her mother will be visiting in the weekend and plan is to obtain the rest of the paternal family history if we can.  Tumor is being tested for microsatellite instability and we will discus this when those result are available.  She ha one sibling and he is up-to-date on colonoscopy.  She doe report multiple tube of blood were drawn prior to her admission.  I will check with Dr. Y's office whether she ha had a CEA and liver-associated enzyme assessed.

The patient is status post resection of the dorsal nasal sidewall skin cancer with nasolabial flap reconstruction with subsequent deformity.  In particular, the patient ha had effacement of his alar crease with deepening of his nasolabial fold and notable asymmetry.  The patient wa seen in consultation and felt to be a surgical candidate for improvement.  Risks and benefit of the operation were described to the patient in detail including, but not limited to bleeding, infection, scarring, possible damage to surrounding structure including neurovascular structures, need for revision of surgery, continued asymmetry, and anesthetic complication.  The patient understood these risk and benefit and consented to the operation.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient wa taken to OR and placed supine on the operating table.  Dose of antibiotic wa given to the patient.  Compression device were placed on the lower extremity to prevent the knee embolic events.  The patient wa turned to 180 degrees.  The ETT tube wa secured and the area wa then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  A head wrap wa then placed on the position and we then began our local.  Of note, the patient had previous incision just lateral to his lateral canthus bilaterally and that were used for access.  Local consisting a 50:50 mix of 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine and 1% lidocaine with epinephrine wa then injected into the subperiosteal plane taking care to prevent injury to the infraorbital nerves.  This wa done bilaterally.  We then marked the nasolabial fold and began with the elevation of the left midface.,We began with a lateral canthal-type incision extending out over his previous incision down to subcutaneous tissue.  We continued down to the lateral orbital rim until we identified periosteum.  We then pulled in a periosteal elevator and elevated the midface down over the zygoma elevating some lateral mesenteric attachment down over the buccal region until we felt we had reached pas the nasolabial fold medially.  Care wa taken to preserve the infraorbital nerve and that wa visualized after elevation.  We then released the periosteum distally and retracted up on the periosteum and noted improved contour of the nasolabial fold with increased bulk over the midface region over the zygoma.,We then used our Endotine Coapt device to engage the periosteum at the desired location and then elevated the midface and secured into position using the Coapt bioabsorbable screw.  After this wa then carried out, we then clipped and cut a well a the end of the screw.  Satisfied with this, we then elevated the periosteum and secured it to reinforce our midface elevation to the lateral orbital rim and this wa done using 3-0 Monocryl.  Several suture were then used to anchor the orbicularis and deeper tissue to create additional symmetry.  Excess skin along the incision wa then removed a well the skin from just lateral to the canthus.  Care wa taken to leave the orbicularis muscle down.  We then continued closing our incision using absorbable plain gut 5-0 suture for the subciliary-type incision and then continuing with interrupted 6-0 Prolenes lateral to the canthus.,We then turned our attention to performing the z-plasty portion of the case.  A z-plasty wa designed along the previous scar where it wa padding to the notable scar deformity and effacement of crease and the z-plasty wa then designed to lengthen along the scar to improve the contour.  This wa carried out using a 15 blade down to subcutaneous tissue.  The flap were debulked slightly to reduce the amount of fullness and then transposed and sutured into place using chromic suture.  At this point, we then noted that he had improvement of the nasal fold but continued asymmetry with regard to improved bulk on the left side and le bulk on the right and it wa felt that a symmetrization procedure wa required to make more symmetry with the midface bilaterally and nasolabial fold bilaterally.  As such, we then carried out the dissection after injecting local a noted and we used a 15 blade scalpel to create our incision along the lateral canthus along it preexisting incision.  We carried this down to the lateral orbital rim again elevating the periosteum taking care to preserve infraorbital nerve.,At this point, we then released the periosteum distally just at the level of the nasolabial fold and placed our Endotine midface implant into the desired area and then elevated slightly just for symmetry only.  This wa then secured in place using the bioabsorbable screw and then resected a very marginal amount of tissue just for removal of the dog ear deformity and closed the deeper layer of tissue using 3-0 PDS and then closing the extension to the subciliary area using 5-0 plain gut and then 6-0 Prolene lateral to the canthus.,At this point, we felt that we had achieved improved contour, improved symmetry, and decreased effacement of the nasolabial fold and alar crease.  Satisfied with our procedures, we then placed cool compress on to the eyes.,The patient wa then extubated and brought to the PACU in stable condition.,Dr. X wa present and scrubbed for the entire case and actively participated during all key elements.

He now present with significant upper airway resistance and nasal obstruction and is unable to tolerate a CPAP machine.  Therefore, for repair of the above-mentioned deformity including the internal and external nasal valve collapse a well a straightening of the deviated septum, the risk and benefit of the procedure were discussed with him included but not limited to bleeding, infection, septal perforation, need for further surgeries, external deformity, and he desired to proceed with surgery.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient wa taken to the operating room and laid supine upon the OR table.  After the induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, the nose wa decongested using Afrin-soaked pledgets followed by the injection of % lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine in the submucoperichondrial plane bilaterally.  Examination revealed significant deviation of the nasal septum and the bony cartilaginous junction a well a the large septal spur along the floor.  The caudal septum appeared to be now in adequate position.  There wa evidence that there had been a previous caudal septal graft on the right naris and it wa decided to leave this in place.  Following the evaluation of the nose, a hemitransfixion incision wa made on the left revealing a large septal spur consisting primarily down on the floor of the left nostril creating nearly a picture of the vestibular stenosis on the side.  Very carefully, the mucoperichondrial flap were elevated over this, and it wa excised using an osteotome taking care to preserve the 1.5 cm dorsal and caudal strap of the nasal septum and keep it attached to the nasal spine.  Very carefully, the bony cartilaginous junction wa identified and a small piece of the bone, where the spur was, wa carefully removed.  Following this, it wa noted that the cartilaginous region wa satisfactory in quantity a well a quality to perform adequate grafting procedures.  Therefore, attention wa turned to harvesting the right-sided auricular cartilage, which wa done after the region had adequately been prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  Postauricular incision using a #15 blade, the area of the submucoperichondrial plane wa elevated in order to preserve the nice lining and identifiable portion of the cartilage taking care to preserve the ridge of the helix at all times.  This wa very carefully harvested.  This area had been injected previously with 1% lidocaine and 1:100,000 epinephrine.  Following this, the cartilage wa removed.  It wa placed in saline, noted to be fashioned in the bilateral spreader graft and alar rim graft a well a a small piece of crush which wa used to be placed along the top of the dorsal irregularity.  The spreader graft were sutured in place using submucoperichondrial pockets.  After an external septorhinoplasty approach had been performed and reflection of the skin and soft tissue envelope had been performed, adequately revealing straight septum with significant narrowing with what appeared to be detached perhaps from his ipsilateral cartilage rather from his previous surgery.  These were secured in place in the pocket using a 5-0 PDS suture in a mattress fashion in two places.  Following this, attention wa turned to placing the alar rim graft where pocket were created along the caudal aspect of the lower lateral cartilage and just along the alar margin.  Subsequently, the alar rim graft were placed and extended all the way to the piriform aperture.  This wa sutured in place using a 5-0 self-absorbing gut suture.  The lower lateral cartilage ha had some inherent asymmetry.  This may have been related to his previous surgery with some asymmetry of the dome; however, this wa left in place a he did not desire any change in the tip region, and there wa adequate support.  An endodermal suture wa placed just to reenforce the region using a 5-0 PDS suture.  Following all this, the area wa closed using a mattress 4-0 plain gut on a Keith needle followed by the application of ***** 5-0 fast-absorbing gut to close the hemitransfixion incision.  Very carefully, the skin and subcutaneous tissue envelope were reflected.  The curvilinear incision wa closed using a Vicryl followed by interrupted 6-0 Prolene sutures.  The marginal incision were then closed using 5-0 fast-absorbing gut.  Doyle splint were placed and secured down using a nylon suture.  They had ointment also placed on them.  Following this, nasopharynx wa suctioned.  There were no further abnormality noted and everything appeared to be in nice position.

Adequate IV sedation wa administered by the Department of Anesthesia and a total of 3.5 cc of 1:1 mixture 1% lidocaine and 0.5% Marcaine plain were injected into the right hallux a a digital block.  The foot wa prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion lowering the operative field.,Attention wa directed to the hallux where there wa a full-thickness ulceration to the distal tip of the hallux measuring 0.5 cm x 0.5 cm.  There wa a ________ tract, which probed through the distal phalanx and along the side of the proximal phalanx laterally.  The toe wa 2.5 time to the normal size.  There were superficial ulceration in the medial arch of both foot secondary to history of a burn, which were not infected.  The patient had dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse that were found to be +2/4 bilaterally preoperatively.  X-ray revealed complete distraction of the distal phalanx and questionable distraction of the lateral aspect of the proximal phalanx.  A #10 blade wa used to make an incision down the bone in a transverse fashion just proximal to the head of the proximal phalanx.  The incision wa carried mediolaterally and plantarly encompassing the toe leaving a large amount of plantar skin intact.  Next, the distal phalanx wa disarticulated at the interphalangeal joint and removed.  The distal toe wa amputated and sent to laboratory for bone culture and sensitivity a well a tissue pathology.  Next, the head of the proximal phalanx wa inspected and found to be soft on the distal lateral portion a suspected.

The patient ha a history of diabetes and ha had a chronic ulceration to the right hallux and ha been on outpatient antibiotics, which he failed.  The patient after a multiple conservative treatment such a wound care antibiotics, the patient wa given the option of amputation a a treatment for the chronic resistant osteomyelitis.  The patient desire to attempt a surgical correction.  The risk versus benefit of the procedure were discussed with the patient in detail by Dr. X.  The consent wa available on the chart for review.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After patient wa taken to the operating room via cart and placed on the operating table in the supine position, a safety strap wa placed across his waist.  Adequate IV sedation wa administered by the Department of Anesthesia and a total of 3.5 cc of 1:1 mixture 1% lidocaine and 0.5% Marcaine plain were injected into the right hallux a a digital block.  The foot wa prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion lowering the operative field.,Attention wa directed to the hallux where there wa a full-thickness ulceration to the distal tip of the hallux measuring 0.5 cm x 0.5 cm.  There wa a ________ tract, which probed through the distal phalanx and along the side of the proximal phalanx laterally.  The toe wa 2.5 time to the normal size.  There were superficial ulceration in the medial arch of both foot secondary to history of a burn, which were not infected.  The patient had dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse that were found to be +2/4 bilaterally preoperatively.  X-ray revealed complete distraction of the distal phalanx and questionable distraction of the lateral aspect of the proximal phalanx.  A #10 blade wa used to make an incision down the bone in a transverse fashion just proximal to the head of the proximal phalanx.  The incision wa carried mediolaterally and plantarly encompassing the toe leaving a large amount of plantar skin intact.  Next, the distal phalanx wa disarticulated at the interphalangeal joint and removed.  The distal toe wa amputated and sent to laboratory for bone culture and sensitivity a well a tissue pathology.  Next, the head of the proximal phalanx wa inspected and found to be soft on the distal lateral portion a suspected.  Therefore, a sagittal saw wa used to resect approximately 0.75 cm of the distal aspect of head of the proximal phalanx.  This bone wa also sent off for culture and wa labeled proximal margin.  Next, the flexor hallucis longus tendon wa identified and retracted a far a possible distally and transected.  The flexor tendon distally wa gray discolored and wa not viable.  A hemostat wa used to inspect the flexor sheath to ensure no infection tracking up the sheath proximally.  None wa found.  No purulent drainage or abscess wa found.  The proximal margin of the surgical site tissue wa viable and healthy.  There wa no malodor.  Anaerobic and aerobic culture were taken and passed this a a specimen to microbiology.  Next, copious amount of gentamicin and impregnated saline were instilled into the wound.,A #3-0 Vicryl wa used to reapproximate the deep subcutaneous layer to release skin tension.  The plantar flap wa viable and wa debulked with Metzenbaum scissors.  The flap wa folded dorsally and reapproximated carefully with #3-0 nylon with a combination of simple interrupted and vertical mattress sutures.  Iris scissors were used to modify and remodel the plantar flap.  An excellent cosmetic result wa achieved.  No tourniquet wa used in this case.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and surgery without apparent complications.  A standard postoperative dressing wa applied consisting of saline-soaked Owen silk, 4x4s, Kerlix, and Coban.  The patient wa transported via cart to Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital sign able and vascular status intact to right foot.

We increased his extension and flexion to about 20 to 120 degree and the pronation and supination to about 40 degrees.,LOCAL ANESTHETIC:  ,10 mL of 0.25% Marcaine.,HISTORY AND PHYSICAL: , The patient is a 10-year-old right-hand dominant male, who threw himself off a quad on 10/10/2007.  The patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation of his left elbow fracture dislocation.  The patient also sustained a nondisplaced right glenoid neck fracture.  The patient's fracture ha healed without incident, although he had significant postoperative stiffness for which he is undergoing physical therapy, a well a use of a Dynasplint.  The patient is neurologically intact distally.  Given the fact that his fracture ha healed, surgery wa recommended for hardware removal to decrease his irritation with elbow extension from the hardware.  Risks and benefit of the surgery were discussed.  The risk of surgery included the risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, change in sensation and motion of the extremities, failure to remove hardware, failure to relieve pain, continued postoperative stiffness.  All question were answered and the parent agreed to the above plan.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient wa taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table.  General anesthesia wa then administered.  The patient's left upper extremity wa then prepped and draped in a standard surgical fashion.  Using fluoroscopy, the patient's K-wire wa located.  An incision wa made over his previous scar.  A subcutaneous dissection then took place in the plane between the subcutaneous fat and muscles.  The K-wires were easily palpable.  A small incision wa made into the triceps, which allowed for visualization of the two pins, which were removed without incident.  The wound wa then irrigated.  The triceps split wa now closed using #2-0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissue wa also closed using #2-0 Vicryl and the skin with #4-0 Monocryl.  The wound wa clean and dry and dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform, and 4 x 4s, a well a bias.  A total of 10 mL of 0.25% Marcaine wa injected into the incision, a well a the joint line.

She admits to some nausea associated with it.  There have been no fevers, chills, and/or genitourinary symptoms.  The patient had right lower quadrant tenderness with rebound and percussion tenderness in the right lower quadrant.  She had a leukocytosis of 12.8.  She did undergo a CT of the abdomen and pelvis, which wa non diagnostic for an acute appendicitis.  Given the severity of her abdominal examination and her persistence of her symptoms, we recommend the patient undergo diagnostic laparoscopy with probable need for laparoscopic appendectomy and possible open appendectomy.  The risks, benefits, complication of the procedure, she gave u informed consent to proceed.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS:  ,Exploration of the abdomen via laparoscopy revealed an appendix with suppurative fluid surrounding it, it wa slightly enlarged.  The left ovary revealed some follicular cysts.  There wa no evidence of adnexal mass and/or torsion of the fallopian tubes.  The uterus revealed no evidence of mass and/or fibroid tumors.  The remainder of the abdomen wa unremarkable.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient wa brought to the operative suite, placed in the supine position.  The abdomen wa prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion with Betadine solution.  The patient underwent general endotracheal anesthesia.  The patient also received a preoperative dose of Ancef 1 gram IV.  After adequate sedation wa achieved, a #10 blade scalpel wa used to make an infraumbilical transverse incision utilizing a Veress needle.  Veress needle wa inserted into the abdomen and the abdomen wa insufflated approximately 15 mmHg.  Once the abdomen wa sufficiently insufflated, a 10 mm bladed trocar wa inserted into the abdomen without difficulty.  A video laparoscope wa inserted into the infraumbilical trocar site and the abdomen wa explored.  Next, a 5 mm port wa inserted in the midclavicular line of the right upper quadrant region.  This wa inserted under direct visualization.  Finally, a suprapubic 12 mm portal wa created.  This wa performed with #10 blade scalpel to create a transverse incision.  A bladed trocar wa inserted into the suprapubic region.  This wa done again under direct visualization.  Maryland dissector wa inserted into the suprapubic region and a window wa created between the appendix and mesoappendix at the base of the cecum.  This wa done while the 5 mm trocar wa used to grasp the middle portion of the appendix and retracted anteriorly.  Utilizing a endovascular stapling device, the appendix wa transected and doubly stapled with this device.  Next, the mesoappendix wa doubly stapled and transected with the endovascular stapling device.  The staple line wa visualized and there wa no evidence of bleeding.  The abdomen wa fully irrigated with copious amount of normal saline.  The abdomen wa then aspirated.  There wa no evidence of bleeding.  All port were removed under direct visualization.  No evidence of bleeding from the port sites.  The infraumbilical and suprapubic port were then closed.  The fascia were then closed with #0-Vicryl suture on a UR6 needle.  Once the fascia were closed, all incision were closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl.  The area were cleaned, Steri-Strips were placed across the wound.

This wa done under a local and IV sedation via the Anesthesia Department.,HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS:,  This is a 37-year-old African-American male with a mass present at the posterolateral aspect of his right knee.  On aspiration, it wa originally attempted to no avail.  There wa a long-standing history of this including two different MRIs, one about a year ago and one very recently both of which did not delineate the mass present.  During aspiration previously, the patient had experienced neuritic type symptom down his calf, which have mostly resolved by the time that this had occurred.  The patient continued to complain of pain and dysfunction to his calf.  This wa discussed with him at length.  He wished this to be explored and the mass excised even though knowing the possibility that they would not change his pain pattern with the potential of reoccurrence a well a the potential of scar stiffness, swelling, and peroneal nerve palsy.  With this, he decided to proceed.,Upon observation preoperatively, the patient wa noted to have a hard mass present to the posterolateral aspect of the right knee.  It wa noted to be tender.  It wa marked preoperatively prior to an anesthetic.  Upon dissection, the patient wa noted to have significant thickening of the posterior capsule.  The posterolateral aspect of the knee above the posterolateral complex at the gastroc attachment to the lateral femoral condyle.  There wa also noted to be prominence of the lateral femoral condyle ridge.  The bifurcation at the tibial and peroneal nerve were identified and no neuroma wa present.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient wa laid supine upon the operating table.  After receiving IV sedation, he wa placed prone.  Thigh tourniquet wa placed.  He wa prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A transverse incision wa carried down across the crease with a mass had been palpated through skin and subcutaneous tissue after exsanguination of the limb and tourniquet utilized.  The nerve wa identified and carefully retracted throughout the case.  Both nerve were identified and carefully retracted throughout the case.  There wa noted to be no neuroma present.  This wa taken down until the gastroc wa split.  There wa gross thickening of the joint capsule and after arthrotomy, a section of the capsule wa excised.  The lateral femoral condyle wa then osteophied.  We then smoothed off with a rongeur.  After this, we could not palpate any mass whatsoever placing pressure upon the area of the nerve.  Tourniquet wa deflated.  It wa checked again.  There wa no excessive swelling.  Swanson drain wa placed to the depth of the wound and interrupted #2-0 Vicryl wa utilized for subcutaneous fat closure and #4-0 nylon wa utilized for skin closure.  Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and Webril were placed for compression dressing.  Digits were warm _______ pulse distally at the end of the case.

She recall that in 1996 when her husband died her headache became more frequent.  They were pulsating.  She wa given papaverine, which wa successful in reducing the severity of her symptoms.  After six month of taking papaverine, she no longer had any headaches.  In 2004, her headache returned.  She also noted that she had ""zig-zag lines"" in her vision.  Sometimes she would not see thing in her peripheral visions.  She had photophobia and dizziness, which wa mostly lightheadedness.  On one occasion she almost had a syncope.  Again she ha started taking Russian medications, which did help her.  The dizziness and headache have become more frequent and now occur on average once to twice per week.

Posterior cervical fusion C4-C5.,3.  Songer wire.,4.  Right iliac bone graft.,TECHNIQUE:  ,The patient wa brought to the operating room.  Preoperative evaluation included previous cervical spine surgery.  The patient initially had some relief; however, his left arm pain did recur and gradually got worse.  Repeat study including myelogram and postspinal CTs revealed some blunting of the nerve root at C4-C5 and C5-C6.  There wa also noted to be some annular bulge at C3-C4, and C6-C7.  The CT scan in March revealed that the fusion wa not fully solid.  X-rays were done in November including flexion and extension views, it appeared that the fusion wa solid.,The patient had been on pain medication.  The patient had undergone several nonoperative treatments.  He wa given the option of surgical intervention.  We discussed Botox, I discussed with the patient and posterior cervical decompression.  I explained to the patient this will leave a larger scar on his neck, and that no guarantee would help, there would be more bleeding and more pain from the posterior surgery than it wa from the anterior surgery.  If at the time of surgery there wa some motion of the C4-C5 level, I would recommend a fusion.  The patient wa a smoker and had been advised to quit smoking but ha not quit smoking.  I have therefore recommended that he use iliac bone graft.  I explained to the patient that this would give him a scar over the back of the right pelvis and could be a source of chronic pain for the patient for the rest of his life.  Even if this type of bone graft wa used, there wa no guarantee that it will fuse and he should stop smoking completely.,The patient also wa advised that if I did a fusion, I would also use post instrumentation, which wa a wire.  The wire would be left permanently.,Even with all these procedures, there wa no guarantee that his symptom would improve.  His numbness, tingling, and weakness could get worse rather than better, his neck pain and arm pain could persist.  He still had some residual bursitis in his left shoulder and this would not be cured by this procedure.  Other procedure may be necessary later.  There is still with a danger of becoming quadriplegic or losing total control of bowel or bladder function.  He could lose total control of his arm or leg and end up in the bed for the rest of his life.  He could develop chronic regional pain syndromes.  He could get difficulty swallowing or eating.  He could have substantial weakness in the arm.  He wa advised that he should not undergo the surgery unless the pain is persistent, severe, and unremitting.,He wa also offered his record if he would like any other pain medication or seek other treatments, he wa advised that Dr. X would continue to prescribe pain medication if he did not wish to proceed with surgery.,He stated he understood all the risks.  He did not wish to get any other treatments.  He said the pain ha reached the point that he wished to proceed with surgery.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , In the operating room, he wa given general endotracheal anesthesia.,I then carefully rolled the patient on thoracic rolls.  His head wa controlled by a horseshoe holder.  The anesthesiologist checked the eye position to make sure there wa no pressure on the orbit and the anesthesiologist continued to check them every 15 minutes.  The arms, the right hip, and the neck wa then prepped and draped.  Care wa taken to position both arm and both legs.  Pulses were checked.,A midline incision wa made through the skin and subcutaneous tissue on the cervical spine.  A loupe magnification and headlamp illumination wa used.  Bleeding vessel were cauterized.  Meticulous hemostasis wa carried out throughout the procedure.  Gradually and carefully I exposed the spinous process of the C6, C5, and C4.  A lateral view wa done after an instrument in place.  This revealed the C6-C7 level.  I therefore did a small laminotomy opening at C4-C5.  I placed an instrument and x-ray confirmed C4-C5 level.,I stripped the muscle from the lamina and then moved them laterally and held with a self-retaining retractor.,Once I identified the level, I then used a bur to thin the lamina of C5.  I used a 1-mm, followed by a 2-mm Kerrison rongeur to carefully remove the lamina off C5 on the left.  I removed some of the superior lamina of C6 and some of the inferior lamina of C4.  This allowed me to visualize the dura and the nerve root and gradually do neural foraminotomies for both the C5 and C6 nerve roots.  There wa some bleeding from the epidural vein and a bipolar cautery wa used.  Absolutely no retractor were ever placed in the canal.  There wa no retraction.

The nerve root had been fully decompressed.,I then checked stability.  There wa micromotion at the C4-C5 level.  I therefore elected to proceed with a fusion.,I debrided the interspinous ligament between C4 and C5.  I used a bur to roughen up the surface of the superior portion of the spinous process of C5 and the inferior portion of C4.  Using a small drill, I opened the facet at C4-C5.  I then used a very small curette to clean up the articular cartilage.  I used a bur then to roughen up the lamina at C4-C5.,Attention wa turned to the right and left hip, which wa also prepped.

Informed consent wa obtained. Patient received several set of drop in his/her XXX eye including Ocuflox and Ocular. (S)He wa taken to the operating room where monitored anesthetic care wa initiated. Retrobulbar anesthesia wa then administered to the XXX eye using a 50:50 mixture of 2% plain lidocaine and 0.05% Marcaine. The XXX eye wa then prepped and draped in the usual sterile ophthalmic fashion. A speculum wa placed on the eyelid and microscope wa brought into position. A #7-0 Vicryl suture wa passed through the superotemporal limbus and traction suture wa placed at the superotemporal limbus and the eye wa rotated infranasally so a to expose the superotemporal conjunctiva. At this point, smooth forceps and Westcott scissors were used to create a 100-degree superotemporal conjunctival peritomy, approximately 2 mm posterior to the superotemporal limbus. This wa then dissected anteriorly to the limbus edge and then posteriorly. Steven scissors were then dissected in a superotemporal quadrant between the superior and lateral rectus muscle to provide good exposure. At this point, we primed the Ahmed valve with a #27 gauge cannula using BSS and it wa noted to be patent. We then placed Ahmed valve in the superotemporal subconjunctival recess underneath the subtenon space and this wa pushed posteriorly. We then measured with caliper so that it wa positioned 9 mm posterior to the limbus. The Ahmed valve wa then tacked down with #8-0 nylon suture through both fenestrations. We then applied light cautery to the superotemporal episcleral bed. We placed a paracentesis at the temporal position and inflated the anterior chamber with a small amount of Healon. We then used a #23 gauge needle and entered the superotemporal sclera, approximately 1 mm posterior to the limbus into the anterior chamber away from iris and away from cornea. We then trimmed the tube, beveled up in a 30 degree fashion with Vannas scissors, and introduced the tube through the #23 gauge tract into the anterior chamber so that approximately 2-3 mm of tube wa extending into the anterior chamber. We burped some of the Healon out of the anterior chamber and filled it with BSS and we felt that the tube wa in good position away from the lens, away from the cornea, and away from the iris. We then tacked down the tube to the sclera with #8-0 Vicryl suture in a figure-of- eight fashion. The pericardium wa soaked in gentamicin. We then folded the pericardium 1x1 cm piece onto itself and then placed it over the tube and this wa tacked down in all four quadrant to the sclera with #8-0 nylon suture. At this point, we then re-approximated the conjunctiva to it original position and we closed it with an #8-0 Vicryl suture on a TG needle in a running fashion with interrupted locking bites. We then removed the traction suture. At the end of the case, the pupil wa round, the chamber wa deep, the tube appeared to be well positioned. The remaining portion of the Healon wa burped out of the anterior chamber with BSS and the pressure wa felt to be adequate. The speculum wa removed. Ocuflox and Maxitrol ointment were placed over the eye. Then, an eye patch and shield were placed over the eye. The patient wa awakened and taken to the recovery room in stable condition. ",2.0

Open reduction and internal fixation of right distal radius fracture - intraarticular four piece fracture.,2.  Right carpal tunnel release.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,CLINICAL SUMMARY: , The patient is a 37-year-old right-hand dominant Hispanic female who sustained a severe fracture to the right wrist approximately one week ago.  This wa an intraarticular four-part fracture that wa displaced dorsally.  In addition, the patient previously undergone a carpal tunnel release, but had symptom of carpal tunnel preop.  She is admitted for reconstructive operation.  The symptom of carpal tunnel were present preop and worsened after the injury.,OPERATION:,  The patient wa brought from the ambulatory care unit and placed on the operating table in a supine position and administered general anesthetic by Anesthesia.  Once adequate anesthesia had been obtained, the right upper extremity wa prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Tourniquet wa placed around the right upper extremity.  The upper extremity wa then elevated and exsanguinated using an Esmarch dressing.  The tourniquet wa elevated to 250 mmHg.  The entire operation wa performed with 4.5 loop magnification.  At this time an approximately 8 cm longitudinal incision wa then made overlying the right flexor carpus radialis tendon from the flexion crease to the wrist proximally.  This wa carried down to the flexor carpus radialis, which wa then retracted ulnarly.  The floor of the flexor carpus radialis wa then incised exposing the flexor pronator muscles.  The flexor pollicis longus wa retracted ulnarly and the pronator quadratus wa longitudinally incised 1 cm from it origin.  It wa then elevated off of the fracture site exposing the fracture site, which wa dorsally displaced.  This wa an intraarticular four-part fracture.  Under image control, the two volar piece and dorsal piece were then carefully manipulated and reduced.  Then, 2.06 two-inch K-wires were drilled radial into the volar ulnar fragment and then a second K-wire wa then drilled from the dorsal radial to the dorsal ulnar piece.  A third K-wire wa then drilled from the volar radial to the dorsal ulnar piece.  The fracture wa then manipulated.  The fracture end were copiously irrigated with normal saline and curetted and then the fracture wa reduced in the usual fashion by recreating the defect and distracting it.  Further K-wires were then placed through the radial styloid into the proximal fragment.  A Hand Innovations DVR plate of regular size for the right wrist wa then fashioned over and placed over the distal radius and secured with two K-wires.  At this time, the distal screw were then placed.  The distal screw were the small screws.  These were non-locking screws, all eight screw were placed.  They were placed in the usual fashion by drilling with a small drill bit removing the small introducers and then using it depth.  Again, these were 18-20 mm screws.  After placing three of the screw it wa necessary to remove the K-wires.  There wa excellent reduction of the fragment and the fracture; excellent reduction of the intraarticular component and the fracture.  After the distal screw were placed, the fracture wa reduced and held in place with K-wires, which were replaced and the proximal screw were drilled with the drill guide and the larger drill bit.  The screw were then placed.  These were 12 mm screws.  They were placed 4 in number.  The K-wires were then removed.  Finally, a 3 cm intrathenar incision wa made beginning 1 cm distal to the flexor crease of the wrist.  This wa carried down to the transverse carpal ligament, which wa divided throughout the length of the incision, upon entering the carpal canal, the median nerve wa found to be adherent to the undersurface of the structure.  It wa dissected free from the structure out to it trifurcation.  The motor branch seen entering the thenar fascia and obstructed.  The nerve wa then retracted dorsally and the patient had a great deal of scar tissue in the area of the volar flexion crease to the wrist where she had a previous incision that extended from the volar flexion crease of the wrist overlying the palmaris longus proximally for 1 cm.  In this area, careful dissection wa performed in order to move the nerve from the surrounding structure and the most proximal aspect of the transverse carpal ligament, the more proximally located volar carpal ligament wa then divided 5 cm into the distal forearm on the ulnar side of the palmaris longus tendon.  Incisions were then copiously irrigated with normal saline.  Homeostasis wa maintained with electrocautery.  The pronator quadratus wa closed with 3-0 Vicryl and the above skin incision were closed proximally with 4-0 nylon and palmar incision with 5-0 nylon in the horizontal mattress fashion.  A large bulky dressing wa then applied with a volar short-arm splint maintaining the wrist in neutral position.  The tourniquet wa let down.  The finger were immediately pink.  The patient wa awakened and taken to the recovery room in good condition.  There were no operative complications.  The patient tolerated the procedure well. ",1.0

The patient did receive Ancef.,INDICATIONS AND CONSENT: , This is a 16-year-old African-American male who had an ectopic left testis that severed approximately one-and-a-half year ago.  The patient did have an MRI, which confirmed ectopic testis located near the pubic tubercle.  The risks, benefits, and alternative of the proposed procedure were discussed with the patient.  Informed consent wa on the chart at the time of procedure.,PROCEDURE DETAILS:  ,The patient did receive Ancef antibiotic prior to the procedure.  He wa then wheeled to the operative suite where a general anesthetic wa administered.  He wa prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion and shaved in the area of the intended procedure.  Next, with a #15 blade scalpel, an oblique skin incision wa made over the spermatic cord region.  The fascia wa then dissected down both bluntly and sharply and hemostasis wa maintained with Bovie electrocautery.  The fascia of the external oblique, creating the external ring wa then encountered and that wa grasped in two area with hemostat and sized with Metzenbaum scissors.  This wa then continued to open the external ring and wa then carried cephalad to further open the external ring, exposing the spermatic cord.  With this accomplished, the testis wa then identified.  It wa located over the left pubic tubercle region and soft tissue wa then meticulously dissected and cared to avoid all vascular and testicular structures.,The cord length wa then achieved by applying some tension to the testis and further dissecting any of the fascial adhesion along the spermatic cord.  Once again, meticulous care wa maintained not to involve any neurovascular or content of the testis or va deferens.  Weitlaner retractor wa placed to provide further exposure.  There wa a small vein encountered posterior to the testis and this wa then hemostated into place and cut with Metzenbaum scissors and doubly ligated with #3-0 Vicryl.  Again hemostasis wa maintained with ligation and Bovie electrocautery with adequate mobilization of the spermatic cord and testis.  Next, bluntly a tunnel wa created through the subcutaneous tissue into the left empty scrotal compartment.  This wa taken down to approximately the two-thirds length of the left scrotal compartment.  Once this tunnel ha been created, a #15 blade scalpel wa then used to make transverse incision.  A skin incision through the scrotal skin and once again the skin edge were grasped with Allis forceps and the dartos wa then entered with the Bovie electrocautery exposing the scrotal compartment.  Once this wa achieved, the apex of the dartos were then grasped with hemostat and supra-dartos pouch wa then created using the Iris scissors.  A dartos pouch wa created between the skin and the supra-dartos, both cephalad and caudad to the level of the scrotal incision.  A hemostat wa then placed from inferior to superior through the created tunnel and the testis wa pulled through the created supra-dartos pouch ensuring that anatomic position wa in place, maintaining the epididymis posterolateral without any rotation of the cord.  With this accomplished, #3-0 Prolene wa then used to tack both the medial and lateral aspect of the testis to the remaining dartos into the tunica vaginalis.  The suture were then tied creating the orchiopexy.  The remaining body of the testicle wa then tucked into the supra-dartos pouch and the skin wa then approximated with #4-0 undyed Monocryl in a horizontal mattress fashion interrupted sutures.  Once again hemostasis wa maintained with Bovie electrocautery.  Finally the attention wa made towards the inguinal incision and this wa then copiously irrigated and any remaining bleeder were then fulgurated with Bovie electrocautery to make sure to avoid any neurovascular spermatic structures.  External ring wa then recreated and grasped on each side with hemostat and approximated with #3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion cephalad to caudad.  Once this wa created, the created ring wa inspected and there wa adequate room for the cord.  There appeared to be no evidence of compression.  Finally, subcutaneous layer with suture of #4-0 interrupted chromic wa placed and then the skin wa then closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a running subcuticular fashion.  The patient had been injected with bupivacaine prior to closing the skin.  Finally, the patient wa cleansed.,The scrotal support wa placed and plan will the for the patient to take Keflex one tablet q.i.d. x7 day a well a Tylenol #3 for severe pain and Motrin for moderate pain a well a applying ice pack to scrotum.

The nipple inframammary fold distance is approximately 1.5 cm shorter than the fuller right breast.  The patient ha bilateral Mentor-Smooth round moderate projection jell-filled mammary prosthesis, 225 cc.,The patient wa marked in the upright position for mobilization of lateral skin flap and increase in the length of the nipple inframammary fold distance.  She wa then brought to the operating room and after satisfactory LMA anesthesia had been induced, the patient wa prepped and draped in the usual manger.  The patient received a gram of Kefzol prior to beginning the procedure.  The previous inverted T-scar wa excised down to the underlying capsule of the breast implant.  The breast wa carefully dissected off of the underlying capsule.  Care being taken to preserve the vascular supply to the skin and breast flap.  When the anterior portion of the breast wa dissected free of the underlying capsule, the posterior aspect of the capsule wa then dissected off of the underlying pectoralis muscle.  A posterior incision wa made on the backside of the capsule at the proximate middle portion of the capsule and then reflected inferiorly thereby creating a superior based capsular flap.  The lateral aspect of the capsule were then opened and the inferior edge of the capsule wa then sutured to the underside of the inframammary flap with 2-0 Monocryl statures.  Care wa taken to avoid a much exposure of the implant, a well a damage to the implant.  When the flap had been created and advanced, hemostasis wa obtained and the area copiously irrigated with a solution of Bacitracin 50,000 units, Kefzol 1 g, gentamicin 80 mg, and 500 cc of saline.  The lateral skin both medially and laterally were then completely freed and the vertical incision of the inverted T wa then extended the 2 cm and sutured with a trifurcation suture of 2-0 Biosyn.  This lengthened the vertical portion of the mastopexy scar to allow for descent of the implant and roundness of the inferior pole of the left breast.  The remainder of the inverted T wa closed with interrupted suture of 3 and 2-0 Biosyn and the skin wa closed with continuous suture of 5-0 nylon.

The problem ha been progressive in nature.  The preoperative discussion with the patient included alternative treatment options, the procedure wa explained, and the risk factor such a infection, swelling, scar tissue, numbness, continued pain, recurrence, and the postoperative management were discussed.  The patient ha been advised, although no guarantee for success could be given, most of the patient have le pain and improved function, all question were thoroughly answered.  The patient requested for surgical repair since the problem ha reached a point that interfere with normal daily activity.  The purpose of the surgery is to alleviate pain and discomfort.,DETAILS OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient wa given 1 g of Ancef IV for antibiotic prophylaxis 30 minute prior to the procedure.  The patient wa brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  No tourniquet wa utilized.  IV sedation wa achieved followed by a local anesthetic consisting of approximately 10 mL total in 1:1 mixture of 0.25% Marcaine and 1% lidocaine with epinephrine wa locally infiltrated proximal to the operative site.  The lower extremity wa prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Balanced anesthesia wa obtained.,PROCEDURE:, Closing wedge osteotomy, fifth metatarsal with internal screw fixation, right foot.  A dorsal curvilinear incision wa made extending from the base of the proximal phalanx fifth digit to a point 1.5 cm from the base of the fifth metatarsal.  Care wa taken to identify and retract all vital structure and when necessary, vessel were ligated via electrocautery.  The extensor tendon wa identified and retracted medially.  Sharp and blunt dissection wa carried down through the subcutaneous tissue down to the periosteal layer.  A linear periosteal capsular incision wa made in line with the skin incision.  The capsular tissue and periosteal layer wa underscored, free from it underlying osseous attachment, and then reflected to expose the osseous surface.  Inspection of the fifth metatarsophalangeal joint revealed articular cartilage to be perverse and hypertrophic change to the lateral and dorsolateral aspect of the fifth metatarsal head.  An oscillating saw wa utilized to carefully resect the hypertrophic portion of the fifth metatarsal head to a more normal configuration.  The both edge were rasped smooth.,Attention wa then focused on the fifth metatarsal.  The periosteal layer proximal to the fifth metatarsal head wa underscored, free from it underlying attachment, and then reflected to expose the osseous surface.  An excess guide position perpendicular to the weightbearing surface wa placed to define apex of the osteotomy.,Using an oscillating saw, a vertically placed, wedge-shaped oblique ostomy wa made with the apex being proximal, lateral, and the base medial and distal.  Generous amount of lateral cortex were preserved for the lateral hinge.  The wedge wa removed from the surgical field.  The fifth metatarsal wa placed in the appropriate position and stabilized with a guide pin, which wa then countersunk and a 3-0 x 40 mm cannulated cortical screw wa placed over the guide pin and secured into position.  Good purchase wa noted at the osteotomy site.  Inspection revealed satisfactory reduction of the fourth intermetatarsal angle with the fifth metatarsal in good alignment and position.  The surgical site wa flushed with copious amount of normal saline irrigation.  The periosteal and capsular layer were closed with running suture of 3-0 Vicryl.

Despite this, however; he ha had persistent problem with a cough and ha been more recently started on both a short burst of prednisolone a well a a more prolonged alternating day course.  ,Although there is no smoke exposure there is a significant family history with both Abc's father and uncle having problem with asthma a well a his older sister.  The parent now maintain separate household and there ha been a question about the consistency of his medication administration at his father's house.  ,On exam today, Abc had some scattered rhonchus which cleared with coughing but wa otherwise healthy.  ,We spent the majority of our 45-minute just reviewing basic principle of asthma management and I believe that Abc's mother is fairly well versed in this.  I think the most important thing to realize is that Abc probably doe have fairly severe childhood asthma and fortunately ha avoided hospitalization.  ,I think it would be prudent to continue his alternate day steroid until he is completely symptom free on the day off steroid but it would be reasonable to continue to wean him down to a low a 1.5 milligram (0.5 milliliter on alternate days).

Two Weitlaner were used to hold the scalp open.  A burr hole wa made just anterior to the coronal suture and then the dura wa opened in a cruciate manner and the pia wa coagulated.  Neuropen wa introduced directly through the parenchyma into the ventricular system, which wa quite large and dilated.  CSF wa collected for routine studies.  We saw the total absence of __________  consistent with the congenital form of aqueductal stenosis and a markedly thinned down floor of the third ventricle.  I could bend the ventricular catheter and look back and see the aqueduct, which wa quite stenotic with a little bit of chorioplexus near it opening.  The NeuroPEN wa then introduced through the midline of the floor of the third ventricle anterior to the mamillary body in front of the basilar artery and then wa gently enlarged using NeuroPEN __________  various motions.  We went through the membrane of Liliequist.  We could see the basilar artery and the clivus, and there wa no significant bleeding from the edges.  The Bactiseal catheter wa then left to 7 cm of length because of her macrocephaly and secured to a burr hole port with a 2-0 Ethibond suture.  The wound wa irrigated out with bacitracin and closed using 3-0 Vicryl for the deep layer and a Monocryl suture for the scalp followed by Mastisol and Steri-Strips.  The patient tolerated the procedure well. ",2.0

3325,"HISTORY:,  The patient is a 10-1/2-year-old born with asplenia syndrome with a complex cyanotic congenital heart disease characterized by dextrocardia bilateral superior vena cava, complete atrioventricular septal defect, a total anomalous pulmonary venous return to the right-sided atrium, and double-outlet to the right ventricle with malposed great vessels, the aorta being anterior with a severe pulmonary stenosis.  He had undergone staged repair beginning on 04/21/1997 with a right modified Blalock-Taussig shunt followed on 09/02/1999 with a bilateral bidirectional Glenn shunt, and left pulmonary artery to main pulmonary artery pericardial patch augmentation.  These procedure were performed at Medical College Hospital.  Family state that they moved to the United States.  Evaluation at the Children's Hospital earlier this year demonstrated complete occlusion of the right bidirectional Glenn shunt a well a occlusion of the proximal right pulmonary artery.  He wa also found to have elevated Glenn pressure at 22 mmHg, transpulmonary gradient axis of 14 mmHg.  The QP:QS ratio of 0.6:1.  A large decompressing venous collateral wa also appreciated.  The patient wa brought back to cardiac catheterization in an attempt to reconstitute the right caval pulmonary anastomosis and to occlude the venous collateral vessel.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , After sedation and local Xylocaine anesthesia, the patient wa prepped and draped.  Cardiac catheterization wa performed a outlined in the attached continuation sheets.  Vascular entry wa by percutaneous technique, and the patient wa heparinized.  Monitoring during the procedure included continuous surface ECG, continuous pulse oximetry, and cycled cuff blood pressures, in addition to intravascular pressures.,Using a 6-French sheath, a 6-French wedge catheter wa inserted in the right femoral vein and advanced from the inferior vena cava into the right-sided atrium pulmonary vein and the right ventricle.,Using a 6-French sheath, a 5-French pigtail catheter wa inserted into the right femoral artery and advanced retrograde to the descending aorta and ascending aorta.  A separate port of arterial access wa obtained in the left femoral artery utilizing a 5-French sheath.,Percutaneous access into the right jugular vein wa attempted, but unsuccessful.  Ultrasound on the right neck demonstrated a complete thrombosis of the right internal jugular vein.  Using percutaneous technique and a 5-French sheath, 5-French wedge catheter wa inserted into the left internal jugular vein and advanced along the left superior vena cava across the left caval-pulmonary anastomosis into the main pulmonary artery and left pulmonary artery with aid of guidewire.  This catheter then also advanced into the bridging innominate vein.  The catheter wa then exchanged over wire for a 4-French Bernstein catheter, which wa advanced to the blind end of the right superior vena cava.  A balloon wedge angiogram of the right lower pulmonary vein demonstrated back filling of a small right lower pulmonary artery.  There wa no vascular continuity to the stump of the right Glenn.  The jugular venous catheter and sheath were exchanged over a wire for a 6-French flexor sheath, which wa advanced to the proximal right superior vena cava.  The Bernstein catheter wa then reintroduced using a Terumo guidewire.  Probing of the superior vena cava facilitated access into the right lower pulmonary artery.  The angiogram in the right pulmonary artery showed a diminutive right lower pulmonary artery and severe long segment proximal stenosis.  The distal pulmonary measured approximately 5.5 to 60 mm in diameter with a long segment stenosis measuring approximately 31 mm in length.  The length of the obstruction wa balloon dilated using ultra-thin SD 4 x 2 cm balloon catheter with complete disappearance of the waist.  This facilitated advancement of a flexor sheath into the proximal portion of the stenosis.  A PG 2960 BPX Genesis stent premounted on a 6 mm OptiProbe.  A balloon catheter wa advanced across the area of narrowing and inflated with a near-complete disappearance of proximal waist.  Angiogram demonstrated a good stent apposition to the caval wall.  Further angioplasty wa then performed utilizing an ultra-thin SDS 8 x 3 cm balloon catheter inflated to 19 atmosphere pressure with complete disappearance of a distinct proximal waist.  Angiogram demonstrated wide patency of reconstituted right caval pulmonary anastomosis though there wa no flow seen to the right upper pulmonary artery.  The balloon wedge angiogram were then obtained in the right upper pulmonary vein suggesting the presence of right upper pulmonary artery and not contiguous with the right lower pulmonary artery.  Bernstein catheter wa advanced into the main pulmonary artery where a wire probing of the stump of the proximal right pulmonary artery facilitated access to the right upper pulmonary artery.  Angiogram demonstrated severe long segment stenosis of the proximal right pulmonary artery.  Angioplasty of the right pulmonary wa then performed using the OptiProbe 6-mm balloon catheter inflated to 16 atmosphere pressure with disappearance of a distinct waist.  Repeat angiogram showed improvement in caliber of right upper pulmonary artery with filling defect of the proximal right pulmonary artery.  The proximal right pulmonary artery wa then dilated and stent implanted using a PG 2980 BPX Genesis stent premounted on 8-mm OptiProbe balloon catheter and implanted with complete disappearance of the waist.  Distal right upper pulmonary artery wa then dilated and stent implanted utilizing a PG 1870 BPX Genesis stent premounted on 7-mm OptiProbe balloon catheter.  Repeat angiogram were then performed.  Attention wa then directed to the large venous collateral vessel arising from the left superior vena cava with a contrast filling of a left-sided azygos vein.  A selective angiogram demonstrated a large azygos vein of the midsection measuring approximately 9.4 mm in diameter.  An Amplatzer 12 mm vascular plug wa loaded on the delivery catheter and advanced through the flexor sheath into the azygos vein.  Once stable device wa confirmed, the device wa released from the delivery catheter.  The 4-French Bernstein catheter wa then reintroduced and 5 inch empirical 0.038 inch, 10 cm x 8 mm detachable coil were then implanted above the vascular plug filling the proximal azygos vein.  A pigtail catheter wa then introduced into the left superior vena cava for final angiogram.,Flows were calculated by the Fick technique using an assumed oxygen consumption and content derived from Radiometer Hemoximeter saturation and hemoglobin capacity.,Cineangiograms were obtained with injection of the coronary sinus of pulmonary veins, the innominate vein, superior vena cava, the main pulmonary artery, and azygos vein.,After angiography, two normal-appearing renal collecting system were visualized.  The catheter and sheath were removed and topical pressure applied for hemostasis.  The patient wa returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  There were no complications.,DISCUSSION:,  Oxygen consumption wa assumed to be normal mixed venous saturation, but wa low due to systemic arterial desaturation of 79%.  The pulmonary vein were fully saturated with partial pressure of oxygen ranging between 120 and 169 mmHg in 30% oxygen.  Remaining saturation reflected complete admixture.  There wa increased saturation in the left pulmonary artery due to aortopulmonary collateral flow.  Phasic right atrial pressure were normal with an A-wave somewhat to the normal right ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 9 mmHg.  Left ventricular systolic pressure wa systemic with no outflow obstruction to the ascending aorta.  Phasic ascending, descending pressure were similar and normal.  Mean Glenn pressure at initiation of the case were slightly elevated at 14 mmHg with a transpulmonary gradient of 9 mmHg.  The calculated systemic flow wa a normal pulmonary flow reduced with a QP:QS ratio of 0.6:1.  The pulmonary vascular resistance wa elevated at 4.4 Woods units.  Following stent implantation in the right caval pulmonary anastomosis and right pulmonary artery, there wa a slight increase in the Glenn venous pressure to 16 mmHg.  Following embolization of the azygos vein, there wa increase in systemic arterial saturation to 84% and increase in mixed venous saturation.  There wa similar increase in Glenn pressure to 28 mmHg with a transpulmonary gradient of 14 mmHg.  There wa an increase in arterial pressure.  The calculated systemic flow increased from 3.1 liter /minute/meter squared to 4.3 liters/minute/meter squared.  Angiogram within the innominate vein following stent implantation demonstrated appropriate stent position without significant distortion of the innominate vein or proximal cava.  There appeared unobstructed contrast flow to the right lower pulmonary artery of a 1-mmHg mean pressure gradient.  There wa absence of contrast filling of the right middle and right upper pulmonary artery.  Final angiogram with a contrast injection in the left superior vena cava showed a forward flow through the right Glenn, a good contrast filling of the right lower pulmonary artery, and a widely patent left Glenn negative contrast washout of the proximal right pulmonary artery and left pulmonary artery presumably due to aortopulmonary collateral flow.  Contrast injection within the right upper pulmonary artery following the stent implantation demonstrated widely patent proximal right pulmonary artery along the length of the implanted stent though with retrograde contrast flow.,INITIAL DIAGNOSES:  ,1.

The bimanual exam wa performed, which revealed the above findings.  A weighted speculum wa placed in the patient's posterior vaginal vault and the 12 o' clock position of the cervix wa grasped with the vulsellum tenaculum.  The cervix wa then serially dilated using Hank dilator up to a #10.  A sharp curette wa then introduced and curettage wa performed obtaining a mild amount of tissue.  The tissue wa sent to pathology for evaluation.  The uterine elevator wa then placed in the patient's cervix.  Gloves were changed.  The attention wa turned to the anterior abdominal wall where a 1 cm infraumbilical skin incision wa made.  While tenting up the abdominal wall, the Veress needle wa placed without difficulty.  The abdomen wa then insufflated with appropriate volume and flow of CO2.  The #11 step trocar wa then placed without difficulty in abdominal wall.  The placement wa confirmed with a laparoscope.  It wa then decided to put a #5 step trocar approximately 2 cm above the pubis symphysis in order to manipulate the pelvic contents.  The above finding were then noted.  Because the tubal pregnancy wa adherent to the ovary, an additional port wa placed in the right lateral aspect of the patient's abdomen.  A #12 step trocar port wa placed under direct visualization.  Using a grasper, Nezhat-Dorsey suction irrigator, the mass wa hydro-dissected off of the right ovary and further shelled away with graspers.  This wa removed with the gallbladder grasper through the right lateral port site.  There wa a small amount of oozing at the distal portion of the fimbria where the mass ha been attached.  Partial salpingectomy wa therefore performed.  This wa done using the LigaSure.  The LigaSure wa clamped across the portion of the tube including distal tube and ligated and transected.  Good hemostasis wa obtained in all of the right adnexal structures.  The pelvis wa then copiously suction irrigated.  The area again wa then visualized and again found to be hemostatic.  The instrument were then removed from the patient's abdomen under direct visualization.  The abdomen wa then desufflated and the #11 step trocar wa removed.  The incision were then repaired with #4-0 undyed Vicryl and dressed with Steri-Strips.  The uterine elevator wa removed from the patient's vagina.,The patient tolerated the procedure well.

1389,"Mr. XYZ forgot his hearing aid at home today and is severely hearing impaired and most of the interview had to be conducted with me yelling at him at the top of my voice.  For all these reasons, this wa not really under the best circumstance and I had to curtail the amount of time I spent trying to get a history because of the physical effort required in extracting information from this patient.  The patient wa seen late because he had not filled in the patient questionnaire.  To summarize the history here, Mr. XYZ who is not very clear on event from the past, sustained a work-related injury some time in 1998.  At that time, he wa driving an 18-wheeler truck.  The patient indicated that he slipped off the rear of his truck while loading vehicle to his trailer.  He experienced severe low back pain and eventually a short while later, underwent a fusion of L4-L5 and L5-S1.  The patient had an uneventful hospital course from the surgery, which wa done somewhere in Florida by a surgeon, who he doe not remember.  He wa able to return to his usual occupation, but then again had a second work-related injury in May of 2005.  At that time, he wa required to boat truck to his rig and also to use a chain-pulley system to raise and lower the vehicles.  Mr. XYZ felt a popping sound in his back and had excruciating low back pain and had to be transported to the nearest hospital.  He wa MRI'ed at that time, which apparently showed a re-herniation of an L5-S1 disc and then, he somehow ended up in Houston, where he underwent fusion by Dr. W from L3 through S2.  This wa done on 12/15/2005.  Initially, he did fairly well and wa able to walk and move around, but then gradually the pain reappeared and he started getting severe left-sided leg pain going down the lateral aspect of the left leg into his foot.  He is still complaining of the severe pain right now with tingling in the medial two toe of the foot and significant weakness in his left leg.  The patient wa referred to Dr. A, pain management specialist and Dr. A ha maintained him on opioid medication consisting of Norco 10/325 mg for breakthrough pain and oxycodone 30 mg t.i.d. with Lunesta 3 mg q.h.s. for sleep, Carisoprodol 350 mg t.i.d., and Lyrica 100 mg q.daily.  The patient state that he is experiencing no side effect from medication and take medication a required.  He ha apparently been drug screened and his drug screening ha been found to be normal.  The patient underwent an extensive behavioral evaluation on 05/22/06 by TIR Rehab Center.  At that time, it wa felt that Mr. XYZ showed a degree of moderate level of depression.  There were no indication in the evaluation that Mr. XYZ showed any addictive or noncompliant type behaviors.  It wa felt at that time that Mr. XYZ would benefit from a brief period of individual psychotherapy and a course of psychotropic medications.  Of concern to the therapist at that time wa the patient's untreated and unmonitored hypertension and diabetes.  Mr. XYZ indicated at that time, they had not purchased any prescription medication or any of these health-related issue because of financial limitations.  He still apparently is not under really good treatment for either of these condition and on today's evaluation, he actually denies that he had diabetes.  The impression wa that the patient had axis IV diagnosis of chronic functional limitations, financial loss, and low loss with no axis III diagnosis.  This wa done by Rhonda Ackerman, Ph.D., a psychologist.  It wa also suggested at that time that the patient should quit smoking.  Despite these evaluations, Mr. XYZ really did not get involved in psychotherapy and there wa poor attendance of these visits, there wa no clearance given for any surgical intervention and it wa felt that the patient ha benefited from the use of SSRIs.  Of concern in June of 2006 wa that the patient had still not stopped smoking despite warnings.  His hypertension and diabetes were still not under good control and the patient wa assessed at significant risk for additional health complication including stroke, reduced mental clarity, and future falls.  It wa felt that any surgical intervention should be put on hold at that time.  In September of 2006, the patient wa evaluated at Baylor College of Medicine in the Occupational Health Program.  The evaluation wa done by a physician at that time, whose report is clearly documented in the record.  Evaluation wa done by Dr. B.  At present, Mr. XYZ continues on with his oxycodone and Norco.  These were prescribed by Dr. A two and a half week ago and the patient state that he ha enough medication left to last him for about another two and a half weeks.  The patient state that there ha been no recent change in either the severity or the distribution of his pain.  He is unable to sleep because of pain and his activity of daily living are severely limited.  He spends most of his day lying on the floor, watching TV and occasionally will walk a while.  ***** from detailed questioning show that his activity of daily living are practically zero.  The patient denies smoking at this time.  He denies alcohol use or aberrant drug use.  He obtains no pain medication from no other sources.  Review of MRI done on 02/10/06 show laminectomy at L3 through S1 with bilateral posterior plate and pedicle screw with granulation tissue around the thecal sac and around the left L4-5 and S1 nerve roots, which appear to be retracted posteriorly.

Her symptom progressed and she presented to the emergency room at Brighton Gardens where a chest x-ray revealed evolving right lobar infiltrate.  She wa started on antibiotics.  Infectious Disease wa consulted.  She wa initially begun on vancomycin.  Blood, sputum, and urine culture were obtained; the result of which were negative for infection.  She wa switched to IV Levaquin and received IV Flagyl for possible C. diff colitis a well a possible cholecystitis.  During her hospital stay, she initially wa extremely relatively hypotensive with mild symptom and she became dizzy with upright positioning.  Her systolic blood pressure wa 60-70 mmHg despite rather aggressive IV fluid management up to 250 mL an hour.  She wa seen in consultation by Dr. Y who monitored her fluid and pulmonary treatment.  Due to some elevated liver function tests, she wa seen in consultation by Dr. X.  An ultrasound wa negative; however, she did undergo CT scan of the chest and abdomen and there wa a suspicion of fluid circling the gallbladder.  A HIDA scan wa performed and revealed no evidence of gallbladder dysfunction.  Liver function were monitored throughout her stay and while elevated, did reduce to approximately 1.5 time normal value.  She also wa seen in consultation by Infectious Disease who followed her for several day and agreed with current management of antibiotics.  Over her week-stay, the patient wa moderately hypoxemic with room air pulse oximetry of 90%.

The patient state that she wa knocked over by her friend's dog.  She sustained a subcapital left hip fracture.  Prior to admission, she lived alone in Terrano, wa ambulating with a walker.  All risks, benefits, and potential complication of the procedure were then discussed with the patient and informed consent wa obtained.,HARDWARE SPECIFICATIONS: , A 28 mm medium head wa used, a small cemented femoral stem wa used, and a 28 x 46 cup wa used.,PROCEDURE:  ,All risks, benefits, and potential complication of the procedure were discussed with the patient, informed consent wa obtained.  She wa then transferred from the preoperative care unit to operating suite #1.  Department of Anesthesia administered spinal anesthetic without complications.,After this, the patient wa transferred to the operating table and positioned.  All bony prominence were well padded.  She wa positioned on a beanbag in the right lateral decubitus position with the left hip facing upwards.  The left lower extremity wa then sterilely prepped and draped in the normal fashion.  A skin maker wa then used to mark all bony prominences.  Skin incision wa then carried out extending from the greater trochanter in a curvilinear fashion posteriorly across the buttocks.  A #10 blade Bard-Parker scalpel wa used to incise the skin through to the subcutaneous tissues.  A second #10 blade wa then used to incise through the subcutaneous tissue down to the fascia lata.  This wa then incised utilizing Metzenbaum scissors.  This wa taken down to the bursa, which wa removed utilizing a rongeur.  Utilizing a periosteal elevator a well a the sponge, the fat wa then freed from the short external rotators of the left hip after these were placed and stretched.  The sciatic nerve wa then visualized and retracted utilizing a Richardson retractor.  Bovie wa used to remove the short external rotators from the greater trochanter, which revealed the joint capsule.  The capsule wa cleared and incised utilizing a T-shape incision.  A fracture hematoma wa noted upon entering the joint capsule a well a subcapital hip fracture.  A cork screw wa then used to remove the fractured femoral head, which wa given to the scrub tech which wa sized on the back table.  All bony remnant were then removed from the acetabulum and surrounding soft tissue with a rongeur.  Acetabulum wa then inspected and found to be clear.  Attention wa then turned to the proximal femur where a cutting tunnel wa used to mark the femur for the femoral neck cut.  An oscillating saw wa then used to make the femoral cut.  Box osteotome wa then used to remove the bone from proximal femur.  A Charnley awl wa then used to open the femoral canal, paying close attention to keep the awl in the lateral position.  Next, attention wa turned to broaching.  Initially, a small broach wa placed, first making effort to lateralize the broach then the femoral canal.  It wa felt that the patient ha le benefit from a cemented prosthesis and a small size wa appropriate.  Next, the trial component were inserted consisting of the above-mentioned component sizes.  The hip wa taken through range of motion and tested to adduction, internal and external rotation a well a with a shuck and a posterior directed force on a flexed tip.  It wa noted that these size were stable through the range of motion.  Next, the trial component were removed and the femoral canal wa copiously irrigated and suctioned dried utilizing Super sucker and __________ then inserted pressuring the femoral canal.  The femoral component wa then inserted and then held under pressure.  Extruding cement wa removed from the proximal femur.  After the cement had fully hardened and dried, the head and cup were applied.  The hip wa subsequently reduced and taken again through range of motion, which wa felt to be stable.,Next, the capsule wa closed utilizing #1 Ethibond in figure-of-eight fashion.  Next, the fascia lata wa repaired utilizing a figure-of-eight Ethibond sutures.  The most proximal region at the musculotendinous junction wa repaired utilizing a running #1 Vicryl suture.  The wound wa then copiously irrigated again to suction dry.  Next, the subcutaneous tissue were reapproximated using #2-0 Vicryl simple interrupted sutures.  The skin wa then reapproximated utilizing skin clips.  Sterile dressing wa applied consisting of Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs a well a foam tape.  The patient wa then transferred from the operating table to the gurney.  Leg length were checked, which were noted to be equal and abduction pillow wa placed.  The patient wa then transferred to the Postoperative Care Unit in stable condition. ",2.0

The patient wa taken to cardiac catheterization suite where the right femoral region wa prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  1% lidocaine solution wa used to infiltrate the skin overlying the right femoral artery and vein.  Once adequate anesthesia ha been obtained, a thin-walled #18 gauge Argon needle wa used to cannulate the right femoral artery.  A steel guidewire wa inserted through the needle into the vascular lumen without resistance.  A small nick wa then made in the skin.  The pressure wa held.  The needle wa removed over the guidewire.  Next, a #6 French arterial sheath wa then advanced over the guidewire into the vascular lumen without resistance.  The guidewire and dilator were then removed.  The sheath wa flushed.  Next, an angulated pigtail catheter wa advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under the direct fluoroscopy visualization with the use of a guidewire.  The catheter wa then guided into the left ventricle.  The guidewire and dilator were then removed.  The catheter wa then flushed.  LVEDP wa measured and found to be favorable for a left ventriculogram.  The left ventriculogram wa performed in the RAO position with a single power injection of nonionic contrast material.  LVEDP wa then remeasured.  Pullback wa performed, which failed to reveal an LVAO gradient.  The catheter wa then removed.  Next, a Judkins left #4 catheter wa advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of a guidewire.  The guidewire wa removed.  The catheter wa connected to the manifold and flushed.  The ostium of the left main coronary wa unable to be engaged with this catheter.  Thus it wa removed over a guidewire.  Next, a Judkins left #5 catheter wa advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of a guidewire.  The guidewire wa removed.  The catheter wa connected to the manifold and flushed.  Left main coronary artery wa then engaged.  Using hand injection of nonionic contrast material, the left coronary system wa evaluated in several different views.  The catheter wa then removed from the ostium of the left main coronary artery and wa removed over a guidewire.  Next, a Judkins right #4 catheter wa then advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of a guidewire.  The guidewire wa removed.  The catheter wa connected to the manifold and flushed.  Using hand injection of nonionic contrast material, the right coronary system wa evaluated in several different views.  The catheter wa then removed from the ostium of the right coronary artery and then removed.  The sheath wa then flushed.  Because the patient did have high left ventricular end-diastolic pressures, it wa determined that the patient wound need a right heart catheterization.  Thus an #18 gauge Argon needle wa used to cannulate the right femoral vein.  A steel guidewire wa inserted through the needle into the vascular lumen.  The needle wa removed over the guidewire.  Next, an #8 French venous sheath wa advanced over the guidewire into lumen without resistance.  The guidewire and dilator were then removed.  The sheath wa then flushed.  Next, a Swan-Ganz catheter wa advanced to the level of 20 cm.  The balloon wa inflated.  Under fluoroscopic visualization, the catheter wa guided into the right atrium, right ventricle, and into the pulmonary artery wedge position.  Hemodynamics were measured along the way.

The patient had a marked dorsal hump, which wa both bony and cartilaginous in nature.,2.  The patient had marked hypertrophy of his nasalis muscle bilaterally contributing to the soft tissue dorsal hump.,3.  The patient had a C-shaped deformity to the left before he had tip ptosis.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , The patient is a 22-year-old Hispanic male who is status post blunt trauma to the nose approximately 9 month with the second episode 2 week following and suffered a marked dorsal deformity.  The patient wa evaluated, but did not complain of nasal obstruction, and his main complaint wa his cosmetic deformity.  He wa found to have a C-shaped deformity to the left a well a some tip ptosis.  The patient wa recommended to undergo an open septorhinoplasty to repair of this cosmetic defect.,OPERATION IN DETAIL: , After obtaining a full consent from the patient, identified the patient, prepped with Betadine, brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position on the operating table.  The appropriate Esmarch wa placed; and after adequate sedation, the patient wa subsequently intubated without difficulty.  The endotracheal tube wa then secured, and the table wa then turned clockwise to 90 degrees.  Three Afrin-soaked cottonoids were then placed in nasal cavity bilaterally.  The septum wa then injected with 3 mL of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine in the subperichondrial plane bilaterally.  Then, 50 additional mL of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine wa then injected into the nose in preparation for an open rhinoplasty.,Procedure wa begun by first marking a columellar incision.  This incision wa made using a #15 blade.  A lateral transfixion incision wa then made bilaterally using a #15 blade, and then, the columellar incision wa completed using iris scissors with care not to injure the medial crura.  However, there wa a dissection injury to the left medial crura.  Dissection wa then taken in the subperichondrial plane over the lower lateral cartilage and then on to the upper lateral cartilage.  Once we reached the nasal bone, a Freer wa used to elevate the tissue overlying the nasal bone in a subperiosteal fashion.  Once we had completed exposure of the bony cartilaginous structures, we appreciated a very large dorsal hump, which wa made up of both a cartilaginous and bony portions.  There wa also an obvious fracture of the right upper lateral cartilage.  There wa also marked hypertrophy what appeared to be in the nasalis muscle in the area of the dorsal hump.  The skin wa contributing to the patient's cosmetic deformity.  In addition, we noted what appeared to be a small mucocele coming from the area of the fractured cartilage on the right upper lateral cartilage.  This mucocele wa attempted to be dissected free, most of which wa removed via dissection.  We then proceeded to remove takedown of the dorsal hump using a Rubin osteotome.  The dorsal hump wa taken down and passed off the table.  Examination of the specimen revealed the marking amount of scar tissue at the junction of the bone and cartilage.  This wa passed off to use later for possible onlay grafts.  There wa now a marked open roof deformity of the cartilage and bony sprue.  A septoplasty wa then performed throughout and a Kelly incision on the right side.  Subperichondrial plane were elevated on the right side, and then, a cartilage wa incised using a caudal and subperichondrial plane elevated on the left side.  A 2 x 3-cm piece of the cardinal cartilage wa then removed with care to leave at least 1 cm dorsal and caudal septal strut.  This cartilage wa passed down the table and then 2 columellar strut graft measuring approximately 15 mm in length were then used and placed to close the bony and cartilaginous open roof deformities.  The spreader graft were sewn in place using three interrupted 5-0 PDS suture placed in the horizontal fashion bilaterally.  Once these were placed, we then proceeded to work on the bony open roof.  Lateral osteotomy were made with 2-mm osteotomes bilaterally.  The nasal bone were then fashioned medially to close the open roof deformity, and this reduced the width of the bony nasal dorsum.  We then proceeded to the tip.  A cartilaginous strut wa then fashioned from the cartilaginous septum.  It wa approximately 15 mm long.  This wa placed, and a pocket wa just formed between the medial crura.  This pocket wa taken down to the nasal spine, and then, the strut graft wa placed.  The intradermal suture were then placed using interrupted 5-0 PDS suture to help to provide more tip projection and definition.  The intradermal suture were then placed to help to align the nasal tip.  The cartilage strut wa then sutured in place to the medial crus after elevating the vestibular skin off the medial crus in the area of the plane suturing.  Prior to the intradermal suturing, the vestibular skin wa also taken off in the area of the dome.,The columellar strut wa then sutured in place using interrupted 5-0 PDS suture placed in a horizontal mattress fashion with care to help repair the left medial crural foot.  The patient had good tip support after this maneuver.  We then proceeded to repair the septal deformity created by taking down the dorsal hump with the Rubin osteotome.  This wa done by crushing the remaining cartilage in the morcellizer and then wrapping this crushed cartilage in endogen, which is a radiated collagen.  The autogenous cartilage wa wrapped in endogen in a sandwich fashion, and then, a 4-0 chromic suture wa placed through this to help with placement of the dorsal onlay graft.,The dorsal onlay wa then sewn into position, and then, the 4-0 chromic suture wa brought out through this externally to help the superior placement of the dorsal onlay graft.  Once we were happy with the position of the dorsal onlay graft, the graft wa then sutured in place using two interrupted 4-0 fast-absorbing suture inferiorly just above the superior edge of the lower lateral cartilages.  Once we were happy with the placement of this, we did need to take down some of the bony dorsal hump laterally, and this wa done using a #6 and then followed with a #3 push grafts.  This wrapping wa performed prior to placement of the dorsal onlay graft.,I went through content with the dorsal onlay graft and the closure of the roof deformity a well a placement of the columellar strut, we then felt the patient could use a bit more tip projection; and therefore, we fashioned a radiated rib into a small octagon; and this wa sutured in place over the tip using two interrupted 5-0 PDS sutures.,At this point, we were happy with the test results, although the patient did have significant amount of fullness in the dorsal hump area due to soft tissue thick and fullness.  There do not appear to be any other pathology causing the patient dorsal hump and therefore, we felt we have achieved the best cosmetic result at this point.  The septum wa reapproximated using a fast-absorbing 4-0 suture and a Keith needle placed in the mattress fashion.  The Kelly incision wa closed using two interrupted 4-0 fast-absorbing gut suture.  Doyle splint were then placed within the nasal cavity and secured to the inferior septum using a 3-0 monofilament suture.  The columellar skin wa reapproximated using interrupted 6-0 nylon sutures, and the marginal incision of the vestibular skin wa closed using interrupted 4-0 chromic sutures.,At the end of the procedure, all sponge, needle, and instrument count were correct.  A Denver external splint wa then applied.  The patient wa awakened, extubated, and transported to Anesthesia Care Unit in good condition. ",2.0

He ha a left nasal obstruction and depressed left nasal bone.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient wa given general endotracheal anesthesia and monitored with pulse oximetry, EKG, and CO2 monitors.,The face wa prepped with Betadine soap and solution and draped in a sterile fashion.  Nasal mucosa wa decongested using Afrin pledgets a well a 1% Xylocaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine wa injected into bilateral nasal septal mucoperichondrium and the nasal dorsum, lateral osteotomy sites.,Inspection revealed caudal portion of the cartilaginous septum lying crosswise across the nasal spine area and columella causing obstruction of the left nasal valve.  Further up, the cartilaginous septum wa displaced to the left of the maxillary crest.  There wa a large maxillary crest and supramaxillary crest had a large spur with the vomer bone touching the inferior turbinate.,There wa a large deep groove horizontally on the right side corresponding to the left maxillary crest.,A left hemitransfixion incision wa made.  Mucoperichondrium wa elevated from left side of the cartilaginous septum and mucoperiosteum wa elevated from the ethmoid plate.  Vomer and inferior tunnel wa created at the floor of the left side of the nose to connect the anterior and inferior tunnels, which wa rather difficult at the area of the vomerine spur, which wa very sharp and touching the inferior turbinate.,The caudal cartilaginous septum, which wa lying crosswise, wa separated from the main cartilage leaving approximately 1 cm strut.  The right side mucoperichondrium wa released from the cartilaginous septum a well a ethmoid plate and the maxillary crest area.,The caudal cartilaginous strut wa sutured to the columella with interrupted #4-0 chromic catgut suture to bring it into the midline.,Further back, the cartilaginous septum anterior to the ethmoid plate wa deviated to the left side, so it wa freed from the maxillary crest, nasal dorsum, from the ethmoid plate, and wa sutured in the midline with a transfixion #4-0 plain catgut sutures.,Further posteriorly, the ethmoid plate wa deviated to the left side and portion of it wa removed with Jansen-Middleton punch forceps.,The main deviation wa also caused by the vomerine crest and the maxillary crest and supramaxillary cartilaginous cartilage.,This area wa freed from the perichondrium on both sides.  The maxillary crest wa removed with a gouge.  Vomer wa partially removed with a gouge and the rest of the vomer wa displaced back into the midline.,Thus, the deviated septum wa corrected.  Left hemitransfixion incision were closed with interrupted #4-0 chromic catgut sutures.  The septum wa also filtered with #4-0 plain catgut sutures.,By valve, septal splint were tied to the septum bilaterally with a transfixion #5-0 nylon suture.,Next, the nasal bone suture deviated to the left side were corrected.  The right nasal bone wa depressed and left nasal bone wa wide.  Therefore, the nasal bone were refractured back into the midline by compressing the left nasal bone and elevating the right nasal bone with the nasal bone elevator through the nasal cavities.  The left intercartilaginous incision wa made and the nasal bone were disimpacted subperiosteally and they were molded back into the midline.,Steri-Strips were applied to the nasal dorsal skin and a Denver type of splint wa applied to the nasal dorsal to stabilize the nasal bones.,Nasal cavity were packed with Telfa gauze rolled on both side with bacitracin ointment.

She last saw u in clinic in January 2008 and at that time we recommended that she followup with Dr. Y for medical management of her chronic headaches.  We also recommended that the patient see a psychiatrist regarding her depression, which she stated that she would followup with that herself.  Today, the patient return to clinic because of acute onset of headache that she ha had since her shunt wa adjusted after an MRI on 04/18/08.  She state that since that time her headache have been bad.  They woke her up at night.  She ha not been able to sleep.  She ha not had a good sleep cycle since that time.  She state that the pain is constant and is worse with coughing, straining, and sneezing a well a on standing up.  She state that they feel a little bit better when lying down.  Medication shave not helped her.  She ha tried taking Imitrex a well a Motrin 800 mg twice a day, but she state it ha not provided much relief.  The pain is generalized, but also noted to be quite intense in the frontal region of her head.  She also report ringing in the ear and state that she just doe not feel well.  She report no nausea at this time.  She also state that she ha been experiencing intermittent blurry vision and dimming light a well.  She tell me that she ha an appointment with Dr. Y tomorrow.  She report no other complaint at this time.,MAJOR FINDINGS:,  On examination today, this is a pleasant 38-year-old woman who come back from the clinic waiting area without difficulty.  She is well developed, well nourished, and kempt.,Vital Signs:  Blood pressure 153/86, pulse 63, and respiratory rate 16.,Cranial Nerves:  Intact for extraocular movements.  Facial movement, hearing, head turning, tongue, and palate movement are all intact.  I did not know any papilledema on exam bilaterally.,I examined her shut site, which is clean, dry, and intact.  She did have a small 3 mm to 4 mm round scab, which wa noted farther down from her shunt reservoir.  It look like there is a little bit of dry blood there.,ASSESSMENT:,  The patient appears to have had worsening headache since shunt adjustment back after an MRI.,PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES:,1.  Pseudotumor cerebri without papilledema.,2.  Migraine headaches.,PROCEDURES:,  I programmed her shunt to 90 mmH2O.,PLAN:,  It wa noted that the patient began to have an acute onset of headache pain after her shunt adjustment approximately a week and a half ago.  I had programmed her shunt back to 90 mmH2O at that time and confirmed it with an x-ray.  However, the picture of the x-ray wa not the most desirable picture.  Thus, I decided to reprogram the shunt back to 90 mmH2O today and have the patient return to Sinai for a skull x-ray to confirm the setting at 90.  In addition, she told me that she is scheduled to see Dr. Y tomorrow, so she should followup with him and also plan on contacting the Wilmer Eye Institute to setup an appointment.  She should followup with the Wilmer Eye Institute a she is complaining of blurry vision and dimming of the light occasionally.,Total visit time wa approximately 60 minute and about 10 minute of that time wa spent in counseling the patient.

He understands this procedure, option to it and potential benefit from it.  He strongly wish to proceed.  He accepts all treatment-associated risk to include but not be limited to bleeding requiring transfusion; infection; sepsis; heart attack; stroke; bladder neck contractures; need to convert to an open procedure; urinary fistulae; impotence; incontinence; injury to bowel/rectum/bladder/ureters, etc.; small-bowel obstruction; abdominal hernia; osteitis pubis/chronic pelvic pain, etc.,DESCRIPTION OF THE CASE:  ,The patient wa taken to the operating room, given a successful general anesthetic, placed in the lithotomy position, prepped with Betadine solution and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  My camera port were then placed in the standard fan array.  A camera port wa placed in the midline above the umbilicus using the Hasson technique.  The balloon port wa placed, the abdomen insufflated, and all other port were placed under direct vision.  My assistant wa on the right.  The patient wa then placed in the steep Trendelenburg position, and the robot brought forward and appropriately docked.,I then proceeded to drop the bladder into the peritoneal cavity by incising between the right and left medial umbilical ligament and carrying that dissection laterally along these ligament deep into the pelvis.  This nicely exposed the space of Retzius.  I then defatted the anterior surface of the prostate and endopelvic fascia.,The endopelvic fascia wa then opened bilaterally.  The levator ani muscle were carefully dissected free from the prostate and pushed laterally.  Dissection wa continued posteriorly toward the bundle and caudally to the apex.  The puboprostatic ligament were then transected.  A secure ligature of 0 Vicryl wa placed around the dorsal venous complex.,I then approached the bladder neck.  The anterior bladder neck wa transected down to the level of the Foley catheter, which wa lifted anteriorly in the wound.  I then transected the posterior bladder neck down to the level of the ampulla of the vas.  The ampulla were mobilized and transected.  These were lifted anteriorly in the field, exposing the seminal vesicles, which were similarly mobilized.  Hemostasis wa obtained using the bipolar Bovie.,I then identified the Denonvilliers fascia, and this wa incised sharply.  Dissection wa continued caudally along the anterior surface of the rectum and laterally toward the bundles.  I wa able to then identify the pedicle over the seminal vesicles, which were hemoclipped and transected.,The field wa then copiously irrigated with sterile water.  Hemostasis wa found to be complete.  I then carried out a urethrovesical anastomosis.  This wa accomplished with 3-0 Monocryl ligatures.  Two of these were tied together in the midline.  They were placed at the 6 o'clock position, and one wa run in a clockwise and the other in a counterclockwise direction to the 12 o'clock position where they were securely tied.  A new Foley catheter wa then easily delivered into the bladder and irrigated without extravasation.  The patient wa given indigo carmine, and there wa prompt blue urine in the Foley., ,I then carried out a bladder suspension.  This wa done in hope of obtaining early urinary control.  This wa accomplished with 0 Vicryl ligatures.  One wa placed at the bladder neck and through the dorsal venous complex and then the other along the anterior surface of the bladder to the posterior surface of the pubis.  This nicely re-retroperitonealized the bladder.,The prostate wa then placed in an Endocatch bag and brought out through an extended camera port incision.  A JP drain wa brought in through the 4th arm port and sutured to the skin with 2-0 silk.  The camera port fascia wa closed with running 0 Vicryl.  The skin incision were closed with a running, subcuticular 4-0 Monocryl.,The patient tolerated the procedure very well.  There were no complications.

He wa given ceftriaxone 500 mg IV once daily to treat otitis medium and possible sepsis, and I will add Tylenol and ibuprofen a needed for fevers.  Overnight, he did have his oxygen saturation drop and went into oxygen overnight.  His lung remained clear, but because of the need for O2, we instituted albuterol aerosol every 6 hour to help maintain good lung function.  The nurse were instructed to attempt to wean O2 if possible and advance the diet.  He wa doing clear liquid well and so I saline locked to help to accommodate improve the mobility with the patient.  He did well the following evening with no further oxygen requirement.  He continued to spike fever but last fever wa around 13:45 on the previous day.

After obtaining the informed consent, the patient's posterior left chest wall wa prepped and draped in usual fashion.  Xylocaine 1% wa infiltrated above the seventh intercostal space in the midscapular line.  Initially, I tried to use the thoracentesis set after 1% Xylocaine had been infiltrated, but the needle of the system wa just too short to reach the pleural cavity due to the patient's very thick chest wall.  Therefore, I had to use a #18 spinal needle, which I had to use almost in it entire length to reach the fluid.  From then on, I proceeded manually to withdraw 2000 mL of a light milky fluid.,The patient tolerated the procedure fairly well, but almost at the end of it she said that she wa feeling like fainting and therefore we carefully withdrew the needle.  At that time, it wa getting difficult to withdraw fluid anyway and we allowed her to lie down and after a few minute the patient wa feeling fine.  At any rate, we gave her bolus of 250 mL of normal saline and the patient returned to her room for additional hour of observation.  We then thought that if she wa doing fine, then we will send her home.,A chest x-ray wa performed after the procedure which showed a dramatic reduction of the amount of pleural fluid and then there wa no pneumothorax or no other obvious complication of her procedure., ",2.0

He is currently in the phase of his therapy where he ha developed a profound thrombocytopenia and white cell deficiency.  He present after a fall in the hospital in which he apparently struck his head and now ha a progressive neurologic deterioration consistent with an intracerebral injury.  His CT imaging reveals an acute left subdural hematoma, which is hemispheric.,The patient wa brought to the operating room, placed under satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia.  He had previously been intubated and taken to the Intensive Care Unit and now is brought for emergency craniotomy.  The image were brought up on the electronic imaging and confirmed that this wa a left-sided condition.  He wa fixed in a three-point headrest.  His scalp wa shaved and prepared with Betadine, iodine and alcohol.  We made a small curved incision over the temporal, parietal, frontal region.  The scalp wa reflected.  A single bur hole wa made at the frontoparietal junction and then a 4x6cm bur hole wa created.  After completing the bur hole flap, the dura wa opened and a gelatinous mass of subdural wa peeled away from the brain.  The brain actually looked relatively relaxed; and after removal of the hematoma, the brain sort of slowly came back up.  We investigated the subdural space forward and backward a we could and yet careful not to disrupt any venous bleeding a we close to the midline.  After we felt that we had an adequate decompression, the dura wa reapproximated and we filled the subdural space with saline.  We placed a small drain in the extra dural space and then replaced the bone flap and secured this with the bone plates.  The scalp wa reapproximated, and the patient wa awakened and taken to the CT scanner for a postoperative scan to ensure that there wa no new hemorrhage or any other intracerebral pathology that warranted treatment.  Given that this actual skin looked good with apparent removal of about 80% of the subdural we elected to take patient to the Intensive Care Unit for further management.,I wa present for the entire procedure and supervised this.  I confirmed prior to closing the skin that we had correct sponge and needle count and the only foreign body wa the drain. ",2.0
2915,"REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION:  ,Suspicious calcification upper outer quadrant, left breast.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 78-year-old woman who had undergone routine screening mammography on 06/04/08.  That study disclosed the presence of punctate calcification that were felt to be in a cluster distribution in the left breast mound at the 2 o'clock position.  Additional imaging study confirmed the suspicious nature of these calcifications.  The patient underwent a stereotactic core needle biopsy of the left breast 2 o'clock position on 06/17/08.  The final histologic diagnosis of the tissue removed during that procedure revealed focal fibrosis.  No calcification could be identified in examination of the biopsy material including radiograph taken of the preserved tissue.,Two day post stereotactic core needle biopsy, however, the patient returned to the breast center with severe swelling and pain and mass in the left breast.  She underwent sonographic evaluation and wa found to have a development of false aneurysm formation at the site of stereotactic core needle biopsy.  I wa called to see the patient in the emergency consultation in the breast center.  At the same time, Dr. Y wa consulted in Interventional Radiology.  Dr. Z and Dr. Y were able to identify the neck of the false aneurysm in the left breast mound and this wa injected with ultrasound guidance with thrombin material.  This resulted in immediate occlusion of the false aneurysm.  The patient wa seen in my office for followup appointment on 06/24/08.  At that time, the patient continued to have sign of a large hematoma and extensive ecchymosis, which resulted from the stereotactic core needle biopsy.  There was, however, no evidence of reforming of the false aneurysm.  There wa no evidence of any pulsatile mass in the left breast mound or on the left chest wall.,I discussed the issue with the patient and her husband.  The underlying problem is that the suspicious calcifications, which had been identified on mammography had not been adequately sampled with the stereotactic core needle biopsy; therefore, the histologic diagnosis is not explanatory of the imaging findings.  For this reason, the patient wa advised to have an excisional biopsy of this area with guidewire localization.  Since the breast mound wa significantly disturbed from the stereotactic core needle biopsy, the decision wa to postpone any surgical intervention for at least three to four months.  The patient now return to undergo the excision of the left breast tissue with preoperative guidewire localization to identify the location of suspicious calcifications.,The patient ha a history of prior stereotactic core needle biopsy of the left breast, which wa performed on 01/27/04.  This revealed benign histologic findings.  The family history is positive involving a daughter who wa diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 40.  Other than her age, the patient ha no other risk factor for development of breast cancer.  She is not receiving any hormone replacement therapy.

He state that he ha been tested for STDs in the past but state that he only gave urine and blood for the testing.  He is unaware of the HIV status of his partner but assumes that the partner is uninfected because he look healthy.  The patient also admits to one episode of sexual abuse at the age of 8 by a friend of the family.  As the man wa a member of the family's church, the patient never felt comfortable disclosing this to any of the adult in his life.  He is very concerned about disclosure of his sexual behavior to his family, a they have expressed very negative comment concerning men who have sex with men.

The patient also present with some constitutional symptom including fever, fatigue, abdominal discomfort, and adenopathy on physical examination.  The following are in the differential diagnosis:  Acute Proctitis and  Proctocolitis.,ACUTE HIV SEROCONVERSION: , This subject is sexually active and report inconsistent condom use.  Gastrointestinal symptom have recently been reported commonly in patient with a history of HIV seroconversion.  The rectal symptom of bleeding and pain are not common with HIV, and an alternative diagnosis would be required.,PERIRECTAL ABSCESS: , A patient with a history of receptive anal intercourse is at risk for developing a perirectal abscess either from trauma or a concurrent STD.  The patient could experience more systemic symptom with fever and malaise, a found with this patient.  However, the physical examination did not reveal the typical localized area of pain and edema.,DIAGNOSIS:  ,The subject had rectal culture obtained, which were positive for Neisseria gonorrhoeae.  An HIV ELISA wa positive, a wa the RNA PCR.,DISCUSSION: , This patient demonstrates a number of key issue to consider when caring for an adolescent or young adult.  First, the patient utilized the emergency department for care a opposed to identifying a primary care provider.  Although not ideal in many circumstances, testing for HIV infection is crucial when there is suspicion, since many newly diagnosed patient identify earlier contact with health care provider when HIV counseling and testing were not performed.  Second, this young man ha had both male and female sexual partners.  As young people explore their sexuality, asking about partner in an open, nonjudgmental manner without applying label is integral to helping the young person discus their sexual behaviors.  Assuming heterosexuality is a major barrier to disclosure for many young people who have same-sex attractions.  Third, screening for STDs must take into account sexual behaviors.  Although urine-based screening ha expanded testing of young people, it miss anal and pharyngeal infections.  If a young person is only having receptive oral or anal intercourse, urine screening is insufficient to rule out STDs.  Fourth, this young man had both localized and systemic symptoms.  As his anal symptom were most suggestive of a current STD, performing an HIV test should be part of the standard evaluation.  In addition, a acute infection is on the differential diagnosis, PCR testing should also be considered.  The care provided to this young man included the following.  He wa treated presumptively for proctitis with both IM ceftriaxone a well a oral doxycycline to treat N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis.  Ceftriaxone wa chosen due to the recent report of resistant N gonorrhoeae.  At the time of the diagnosis, the young man wa given the opportunity to meet with the case manager from the adolescent-specific HIV program.  The case manager linked this young man directly to care after providing brief counseling and support.  The case manager maintained contact with the young man until his first clinical visit four day later.  Over the subsequent three months, the young man had two set of laboratory testing to stage his HIV infection.,Set #1 CD4 T-lymphocyte count = 225 cells/mm3, 15% ,Quantitative RNA PCR = 75,000 copies/mL ",1.0

At the onset of therapy, on 03/26/08, the patient wa NPO with a G-tube and the initial speech and language evaluation revealed global aphasia with an aphasia quotient of 3.6/100 based on the Western Aphasia Battery.  Since the initial evaluation, the patient ha attended 60 outpatient speech therapy sessions, which have focussed on her receptive communication, expressive language, multimodality communication skills, and swallowing function and safety.,SHORT-TERM GOALS:,1.  The patient met 3 out of 4 original short-term therapy goals, which were to complete a modified barium swallow study, which she did do and which revealed no aspiration.  At this time, the patient is eating and drinking and taking all medication by mouth; however, her G-tube is still present.  The patient wa instructed to talk to the primary care physician about removal of her feeding tube.,2.  The patient will increase accuracy of yes-no response to greater than 80% accuracy.  She did accomplish this goal.  The patient is also able to identify named object with greater than 80% accuracy.,ADDITIONAL GOALS: , Following the completion of these goals, additional goal were established.  Based on reevaluation, the patient met 2 out of these 3 initial goal and she is currently able to read and understand simple sentence with greater than 90% accuracy independently and she is able to write 10 word related to basic want and need with greater than 80% accuracy independently.  The patient continues to have difficulty stating verbally, yes or no, to question a well a accurately using head gesture and to respond to yes-no questions.  The patient continues to have marked difficulty with her expressive language abilities.  She is able to write simple word to help express her basic want and needs.  She ha made great strides; however, with her receptive communication, she is able to read word a well a short phrase and able to point to named object and answer simple-to-moderate complex yes-no questions.  A reevaluation completed on 12/01/08, revealed an aphasia quotient of 26.4.  Once again, she made significant improvement and comprehension, but continues to have unintelligible speech.  An alternative communication device wa discussed with the patient and her husband, but at this time, the patient doe not want to utilize a communication device.  If, in the future, the patient continues to struggle with her expressive communication, an alternative augmented communication device would be a benefit to her.  Please reconsult at that time if and when the patient is ready to use a speech generating device.  The patient is discharged from my service at this time due to a plateau in her progress.  Numerous home activity were recommended to allow her to continue to make progress at home. ",1.0

A Kelly-Descemet punch wa used to remove a block of limbal tissue. DeWecker scissors were used to perform a surgical iridectomy. The iris wa then carefully reposited back into place and the iridectomy wa visible through the clear cornea. A scleral flap wa then re- approximated back on the bed. One end of the scleral flap wa closed with a #10-0 nylon suture in interrupted fashion and the knot wa buried. The other end of the scleral flap wa closed with #10-0 nylon suture in interrupted fashion and the knot wa buried. The anterior chamber wa then refilled with balanced salt solution and a small amount of fluid wa noted to trickle out of the scleral flap with slow shallowing of the chamber. Therefore it wa felt that another #10-0 nylon suture should be placed and it wa therefore placed in interrupted fashion half way between each of the end suture previously placed. The anterior chamber wa then again refilled with balanced salt solution and it wa noted that there wa a small amount of fluid tricking out of the scleral flap and the pressure wa felt to be adequate in the anterior chamber. Conjunctiva wa then re-approximated to the limbus and closed with #9-0 Vicryl suture on a TG needle at each of the peritomy ends. Then a horizontal mattress style #9-0 Vicryl suture wa placed at the center of the conjunctival peritomy. The conjunctival peritomy wa checked for any leak and wa noted to be watertight using Weck- cel sponge. The anterior chamber wa inflated and there wa noted that the superior bleb wa well formed. At the end of the case, the pupil wa round, the chamber wa formed and the pressure wa felt to be adequate. Speculum and drape were carefully removed. Ocuflox and Maxitrol ointment were placed over the eye. Atropine wa also placed over the eye. Then an eye patch and eye shield were placed over the eye. The patient wa taken to the recovery room in good condition. There were no complications. ",2.0
2923,"CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  Lortab.,PREVIOUS MEDICAL HISTORY: , Cardiac stent in 2000.,PATIENT'S GOAL: , To eat again by mouth.,STUDY:  ,A trial of Passy-Muir valve wa completed to allow the patient to achieve hands-free voicing and also to improve his secretion management.  A clinical swallow evaluation wa not completed due to the severity of the patient's mucus and lack of saliva control.,The patient's laryngeal area wa palpated during a dry swallow and he doe have significantly reduced laryngeal elevation and radiation fibrosis.  The further evaluate of his swallowing function is safety; a modified barium swallow study need to be concluded to objectively evaluate his swallow safety, and to rule out aspiration.  A trial of neuromuscular electrical stimulation therapy wa completed to determine if this therapy protocol will be beneficial and improving the patient's swallowing function and safety.,For his neuromuscular electrical stimulation therapy, the type wa BMR with a single mode cycle time is 4 second and 12 second off with frequency wa 60 __________ with a ramp of 2 seconds, phase duration wa 220 with an output of 99 milliamps.  Electrodes were placed on the suprahyoid/submandibular triangle with an upright body position, trial length wa 10 minutes.  On a pain scale, the patient reported no pain with the electrical stimulation therapy.,FINDINGS:  ,The patient wa able to tolerate a 5-minute placement of the Passy-Muir valve.  He reported no discomfort on the inhalation; however, he felt some resistance on exhalation.  Instructions were given on care placement and cleaning of the Passy-Muir valve.  The patient wa instructed to buildup tolerance over the next several day of his Passy-Muir valve and to remove the valve at anytime or he is going to be sleeping or napping throughout the day.  The patient's voicing did improve with the Passy-Muir valve due to decreased leakage from his trach secondary to finger occlusion.  Mucus production also seemed to decrease when the Passy-Muir wa placed.,On the dry swallow during this evaluation, the patient's laryngeal area is reduced and tissue around his larynx and showed radiation fibrosis.  The patient's neck range of motion appears to be adequate and within normal limits.,A trial of neuromuscular electrical stimulation therapy:,The patient tolerating the neuromuscular electrical stimulation, we did achieve poor passive response, but these muscle were contracting and the larynx wa moving upon stimulation.  The patient wa able to actively swallow with stimulation approximately 30% of presentation.,DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: , The patient with a history of head and neck cancer status post radiation and chemotherapy with radiation fibrosis, which is impeding his swallowing abilities.  The patient would benefit from outpatient skilled speech therapy for neuromuscular electrical stimulation for muscle reeducation to improve his swallowing function and safety and he would benefit from a placement of a Passy-Muir valve to have hands-free communication.,PLAN OF CARE: , Outpatient skilled speech therapy two time a week to include neuromuscular electrical stimulation therapy, Passy-Muir placement and a completion of the modified barium swallow study.,SHORT-TERM GOALS (6 WEEKS):,1.  Completion of modified barium swallow study.,2.  The patient will coordinate volitional swallow with greater than 75% of the neuromuscular electrical stimulations.,3.  The patient will increase laryngeal elevation by 50% for airway protection.,4.  The patient will tolerate placement of Passy-Muir valve for greater than 2 hour during awaking hours.,5.  The patient will tolerate therapeutic feeding with the speech and language pathologist without sign and symptom of aspiration.,6.  The patient will decrease mild facial restriction to the anterior neck by 50% to increase laryngeal movement.,LONG-TERM GOALS (8 WEEKS):,1.  The patient will improve secretion management to tolerable levels.,2.  The patient will increase amount and oral consistency of p.o. intake tolerated without sign and symptom of aspirations.,3.  The patient will be able to communicate without using finger occlusion with the assistance of a Passy-Muir valve. ",1.0

At this time, he ha been admitted for anemia with hemoglobin of 7.1 and requiring transfusion.  He report that he ha no sign or symptom of bleeding and had a blood transfusion approximately two month ago and actually several week before that blood transfusion, he had a transfusion for anemia.  He ha been placed on B12, oral iron, and Procrit.  At this time, we are asked to evaluate him for further cause and treatment for his anemia.  He denies any constitutional complaint except for fatigue, malaise, and some dyspnea.  He ha no adenopathy that he reports.

He is on B12, iron, folic acid, and Procrit.  There are no sign or symptom of blood loss and a recent esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which wa negative.  His creatinine wa 1.  My impression at this time is that he probably ha an underlying myelodysplastic syndrome or bone marrow failure.  His creatinine on this hospitalization wa up slightly to 1.6 and this may contribute to his anemia.,RECOMMENDATIONS:  ,At this time, my recommendation for the patient is that he undergoes further serologic evaluation with reticulocyte count, serum protein, and electrophoresis, LDH, B12, folate, erythropoietin level, and he should undergo a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.  I have discussed the procedure in detail which the patient.  I have discussed the risks, benefits, and success of that treatment and usefulness of the bone marrow and predicting his cause of refractory anemia and further therapeutic interventions, which might be beneficial to him.  He is willing to proceed with the study I have described to him.

4178,"REASON FOR NEUROLOGICAL CONSULTATION: , Cervical spondylosis and kyphotic deformity.  The patient wa seen in conjunction with medical resident Dr. X. I personally obtained the history, performed examination, and generated the impression and plan.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: ,The patient is a 45-year-old African-American female whose symptom first started some one and a half year ago with pain in the left shoulder and some neck pain.  This ha subsequently resolved.  She started vigorous workout in November 2005.  In March of this year, she suddenly could not feel her right foot on the bathroom floor and subsequently went to her primary care physician.  By her report, she had a nerve conduction study and a diagnosis of radiculopathy wa made.  She had an MRI of lumbosacral spine, which wa within normal limits.  She then developed a tingling sensation in the right middle toe.  Symptoms progressed to sensory symptom of her knees, elbows, and left middle toe.  She then started getting sensory sensation in the left hand and arm.  She state that she feel a little bit wobbly at the knee and that she is slightly dragging her left leg.  Symptoms have been mildly progressive.  She is unaware of any trigger other than the vigorous workout a mentioned above.  She ha no associated bowel or bladder symptoms.  No particular position relief her symptoms.,Workup ha included two MRIs of the C-spine, which were personally reviewed and are discussed below.  She saw you for consultation and the possibility of surgical decompression wa raised.  At this time, she is somewhat reluctant to go through any surgical procedure.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,1.  Ocular migraines.,2.  Myomectomy.,3.  Infertility.,4.  Hyperglycemia.,5.  Asthma.,6.  Hypercholesterolemia.,MEDICATIONS: , Lipitor, Pulmicort, Allegra, Xopenex, Patanol, Duac topical gel, Loprox cream, and Rhinocort.,ALLERGIES: , Penicillin and aspirin.,Family history, social history, and review of system are discussed above a well a documented in the new patient information sheet.  Of note, she doe not drink or smoke.  She is married with two adopted children.  She is a paralegal specialist.  She used to exercise vigorously, but of late ha been advised to stop exercising and is currently only walking.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , She doe complain of mild blurred vision, but these have occurred before and seem associated with headaches.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , On examination, blood pressure 138/82, pulse 90, respiratory rate 14, and weight 176.5 pounds.  Pain scale is 0.  A full general and neurological examination wa personally performed and is documented on the chart.  Of note, she ha a normal general examination.  Neurological examination reveals normal cognition and cranial nerve examination including normal jaw jerk.  She ha mild postural tremor in both arms.  She ha mild decreased sensation in the right palm and mild decreased light touch in the right palm and decreased vibration sense in both distal lower extremities.  Motor examination reveals no weakness to individual muscle testing, but on gait she doe have a very subtle left hemiparesis.  She ha hyperreflexia in her lower extremities, worse on the left.  Babinski's are downgoing.,PERTINENT DATA:  ,MRI of the brain from 05/02/06 and MRI of the C-spine from 05/02/06 and 07/25/06 were personally reviewed.  MRI of the brain is broadly within normal limits.  MRI of the C-spine reveals large central disc herniation at C6-C7 with evidence of mild cord compression and abnormal signal in the cord suggesting cord edema.  There is also a fairly large disc at C3-C4 with cord deformity and partial effacement of the subarachnoid space.  I do not appreciate any cord edema at this level.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  ,The patient is a 45-year-old female with cervical spondylosis with a large C6-C7 herniated disc with mild cord compression and signal change at that level.  She ha a small disc at C3-C4 with le severe and only subtle cord compression.  History and examination are consistent with sign of a myelopathy.,Results were discussed with the patient and her mother.  I am concerned about progressive symptoms.  Although she only ha subtle symptom now, we made her aware that with progression of this process, she may have paralysis.  If she is involved in any type of trauma to the neck such a motor vehicle accident, she could have an acute paralysis.  I strongly recommended to her and her mother that she followup with you a soon a possible for surgical evaluation.  I agree with the previous physician who have told her not to exercise a I am sure that her vigorous workout and weight training since November 2005 have contributed to this problem.  I have recommended that she wear a hard collar while driving.  The result of my consultation were discussed with you telephonically. ",2.0

Posterior spine segmental instrumentation from T3-L5, placement of morcellized autograft and allograft.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 500 mL.,FINDINGS: , The patient wa found to have a severe scoliosis.  This wa found to be moderately corrected.  Hardware wa found to be in good position on AP and lateral projection using fluoroscopy.,INDICATIONS: , The patient ha a history of severe neurogenic scoliosis.  He wa indicated for anterior and posterior spinal fusion to allow for correction of the curvature a well a prevention of further progression.  Risks and benefit were discussed at length with the family over many visits.  They wished to proceed.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient wa brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position.  General anesthesia wa induced without incident.  He wa given a weight-adjusted dose of antibiotics.  Appropriate line were then placed.  He had a neuromonitoring performed a well.,He wa then initially placed in the lateral decubitus position with his left side down and right side up.  An oblique incision wa then made over the flank overlying the 10th rib.  Underlying soft tissue were incised down at the skin incision.  The rib wa then identified and subperiosteal dissection wa performed.  The rib wa then removed and used for autograft placement later.,The underlying pleura wa then split longitudinally.  This allowed for entry into the pleural space.  The lung wa then packed superiorly with wet lap.  The diaphragm wa then identified and this wa split to allow for access to the thoracolumbar spine.,Once the spine wa achieved, subperiosteal dissection wa performed over the visualized vertebral bodies.  This required cauterization of the segmental vessels.  Once the subperiosteal dissection wa performed to the posterior and anterior extent possible, the diskectomies were performed.  These were performed from T11-L3.  This wa over 5 levels.  Disks and endplate were then removed.  Once this wa performed, morcellized rib autograft wa placed into the spaces.  The table had been previously bent to allow for easier access of the spine.  This wa then straightened to allow for compression and some correction of the curvature.,The diaphragm wa then repaired a wa the pleura overlying the thoracic cavity.  The rib were held together with #1 Vicryl sutures.  Muscle layer were then repaired using a running #2-0 PDS suture and the skin wa closed using running inverted #2-0 PDS suture a well.  Skin wa closed a needed with running #4-0 Monocryl.  This wa dressed with Xeroform dry sterile dressing and tape.,The patient wa then rotated into a prone position.  The spine wa prepped and draped in a standard fashion.,Longitudinal incision wa made from T2-L5.  The underlying soft tissue were incised down at the skin incision.  Electrocautery wa then used to maintain hemostasis.  The spinous process were then identified and the overlying apophysis were split.  This allowed for subperiosteal dissection over the spinous processes, lamina, facet joints, and transverse processes.  Once this wa completed, the C-arm wa brought in, which allowed for easy placement of screw in the lumbar spine.  These were placed at L4 and L5.  The interspaces between the spinous process were then cleared of soft tissue and ligamentum flavum.  This wa done using a rongeur a well a a Kerrison rongeur.  Spinous process were then harvested for morcellized autograft.,Once all the interspaces were prepared, Songer wire were then passed.  These were placed from L3-T3.,Once the wire were placed, a unit rod wa then positioned.  This wa secured initially at the screw distally on both the left and right side.  The wire were then tightened in sequence from the superior extent to the inferior extent, first on the left-sided spine where I wa operating and then on the right side spine.  This allowed for excellent correction of the scoliotic curvature.,Decortication wa then performed and placement of a morcellized autograft and allograft wa then performed after thoroughly irrigating the wound with 4 liter of normal saline mixed with bacitracin.  This wa done using pulsed lavage.,The wound wa then closed in layers.  The deep fascia wa closed using running #1 PDS suture, subcutaneous tissue wa closed using running inverted #2-0 PDS suture, the skin wa closed using #4-0 Monocryl a needed.  The wound wa then dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform dry sterile dressings, and tape.  The patient wa awakened from anesthesia and taken to the intensive care unit in stable condition.

The nausea and vomiting resolved and did not recur. However, he continued to experience similar HA 3-4 time per week during the early morning upon awakening. He never felt the HA awakened him from sleep. The HA were partially relieved by Tylenol or Advil, and he distracted himself from the pain by remaining active. One week prior to presentation, he started to experience short episode of blurred vision and diplopia. He also became fatigued, le active, and frequently yawned.,He had no prior history of HA and he and his family denied any sign or symptom of focal weakness or numbness, dysphagia, dysarthria, or loss of consciousness.,The patient underwent an MRI brain scan prior to transfer to UIHC. This revealed a mass in the left frontal region adjacent to the left temporal horn. The mass wa an inhomogeneous blend of signal on T1 and T2 image giving a suggestion of acute bleeding, hemosiderin deposition and multiple vessel within the mass.,MEDS:, None.,PMH:, 1) He wa a 7# 15oz. product of a full term, uncomplicated pregnancy and spontaneous vaginal delivery.

Upon injection of the RCCA an avascular mass wa identified in the right temporal lobe displacing the anterior choroidal artery, and temporal branch of the middle cerebral arteries. The internal cerebral vein is displaced to the left suggesting mass effect. There is a hypoplastic A1 segment and fetal origin of the LPCA. The mass wa felt by neuroradiology to represent a hematoma.,He underwent a right frontal craniotomy, 1/28/93. Pathological evaluation of the resected tissue wa consistent with a vascular malformation with inclusive reactive glial tissue and evidence of recurrent and remote hemorrhage. There were dilated vascular channel having wall of variable thickness, but without evidence of elastic lamina by elastic staining. This wa consistent with venous angioma/malformation. ",1.0
1889,"REASON FOR REFERRAL: , Ms. A is a 60-year-old African-American female with 12 year of education who wa referred for neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. X after she demonstrated mild cognitive deficit on a neuropsychological screening evaluation during a followup appointment with him for stroke in July.  A comprehensive evaluation wa requested to ass current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decision and treatment planning.,RELEVANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION:,  Historical information wa obtained from a review of available medical record and clinical interview with Ms. A.  A summary of pertinent information is presented below.  Please refer to the patient's medical chart for a more complete history.,HISTORY OF PRESENTING PROBLEM:,  Ms. A presented to the ABC Hospital emergency department on 07/26/2009 reporting that after she had woken up that morning she noticed numbness and weakness in her left hand, slurred speech, and left facial droop.  Neurological evaluation with Dr. X confirmed left hemiparesis.  Brain CT showed no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect and that she received TPA and had moderate improvement in left-sided weakness.  These symptom were thought to be due to a right middle cerebral artery stroke.  She wa transferred to the ICU for monitoring.  Ultrasound of the carotids showed 20% to 30% stenosis of the right ICA and 0% to 19% stenosis of the left ICA.  On 07/29/2009, she wa admitted for acute inpatient rehabilitation for the treatment of residual functional deficit of her acute ischemic right MCA/CVA.  At discharge on 08/06/2009, she wa mainly on supervision for all ADLs and walking with a rolling walker, but tolerating increased ambulation with a cane.  She wa discharged home with recommendation for outpatient physical therapy.  She returned to the Sinai ER on 08/2009/2009 due to reported left arm pain, numbness, and weakness, which lasted 10 to 15 minute and she reported that it felt ""just like the stroke.""  Brain CT on 08/2009/2009 wa read a showing ""mild chronic microvascular ischemic change of deep white matter,"" but no acute or significant interval change compared to her previous scan.  Neurological examination with Dr. Y wa within normal limits, but she wa admitted for a more extensive workup.  Due to left arm pain an ultrasound wa completed on her left upper extremity, but it did not show deep vein thrombosis.,Followup CT on 08/10/2009 showed no significant interval change.  MRI could not be completed due to the patient's weight.  She wa discharged on 08/11/2009 in stable condition after it wa determined that this event wa not neurological in origin; however, note that Ms. A referred to this a a second stroke.,Ms. A presented for a followup outpatient neurological evaluation with Dr. X on 09/22/2009, at which time a brief neuropsychological screening wa also conducted.  She demonstrated significant impairment in confrontation naming, abstract verbal reasoning, and visual and verbal memory and thus a more comprehensive evaluation wa suggested due to her intent to return to her full-time work duty.  During the current interview, Ms. A reported that she noticed mild memory problem including some difficultly remembering conversations, events, and at time forgetting to take her medications.  She also reported mild difficulty finding word in conversation, solving novel problem and task (e.g. difficulty learning to use her camcorder), but overall denied significant cognitive deficit in attention, concentration, language or other area of cognitive functioning.  When asked about her return to work, she said that she wa still on light duty due to limited physical activity because of residual left leg weakness.  She reported that no one had indicated to her that she appeared le capable of performing her job duties, but said that she wa also receiving fewer file to process and enter data into the computer at the Social Security Agency that she work at.  Note also that she had some difficulty explaining exactly what her job involved.  She also reported having problem falling asleep at work and that she is working full-time although on light duty.,OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,As mentioned, Ms. A continues to have some residual left leg weakness and continues to use a rolling walker for ambulation, but she reported that her motor functioning had improved significantly.  She wa diagnosed with sleep apnea approximately two year ago and wa recently counseled by Dr. X on the need to use her CPAP because she indicated she never used it at night.  She reported that since her appointment with Dr. X, she ha been using it ""every other night.""  When asked about daytime fatigue, Ms. A initially denied that she wa having any difficulties, but repeatedly indicated that she wa falling asleep at work and thought that it wa due to looking at a computer screen.  She reported at time ""snoring"" and forgetting where she is at and said that a supervisor offered to give her coffee at one point.  She receives approximately two to five hour of sleep per night.  Other current untreated risk factor include obesity and hypercholesterolemia.  Her medical history is also significant for hypertension, asthma, abdominal adenocarcinoma status post hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, colonic benign polyp status post resection, benign lesion of the breast status post lumpectomy, and deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity status post six month of anticoagulation (which she had discontinued just prior to her stroke).,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Aspirin 81 mg daily, Colace 100 mg b.i.d., Lipitor 80 mg daily, and albuterol MDI p.r.n.,SUBSTANCE USE:,  Ms. A denied drinking alcohol or using illicit drugs.  She used to smoke a pack of cigarette per day, but quit five to six year ago.,FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY: , Ms. A had difficulty providing information on familial medical history.  She reported that her mother died three to four year ago from lung cancer.  Her father ha gout and blood clots.  Siblings have reportedly been treated for asthma and GI tumors.  She wa unsure of familial history of other condition such a hypertension, high cholesterol, stroke, etc.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , Ms. A completed high school degree.  She reported that she primarily obtained B's and C's in school.  She received some tutoring for algebra in middle school, but denied ever having been held back a grade failing any class or having any problem with attention or hyperactivity.,She currently work for the Social Security Administration in data processing.  As mentioned, she ha returned to full-time work, but continues to perform only light duty due to her physical condition.  She is now living on her own.  She ha never driven.  She reported that she continues to perform ADLs independently such a cooking and cleaning.  She lost her husband in 2005 and ha three adult daughters.  She previously reported some concern that her child wanted her to move into assisted living, but she did not discus that during this current evaluation.  She also reported number of other family member who had recently passed away.  She ha returned to activity she enjoys such a quire, knitting, and cooking and plan to go on a cruise to the Bahamas at the end of October.,PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: , Ms. A did not report a history of psychological or psychiatric treatment.  She reported that her current mood wa good, but did describe some anxiety and nervousness about various issue such a her return to work, her upcoming trip, and other events.  She reported that this only ""comes and goes."",TASKS ADMINISTERED:,Clinical Interview,Adult History Questionnaire,Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR),Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE),Cognistat Neurobehavioral Cognitive Status Examination,Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS; Form XX),Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, 2nd Edition (DRS-2),Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (NAB),Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Third Edition (WAIS-III),Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV),Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI),Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA),Auditory Consonant Trigrams (ACT),Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT),Ruff 2 & 7 Selective Attention Test,Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT),Multilingual Aphasia Examination, Second Edition (MAE-II),  Token Test,  Sentence Repetition,  Visual Naming,  Controlled Oral Word Association,  Spelling Test,  Aural Comprehension,  Reading Comprehension,Boston Naming Test, Second Edition (BNT-2),Animal Naming Test ",1.0
3085,"PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1. Left heart catheterization with coronary angiography, vein graft angiography and left ventricular pressure measurement and angiography.,2. Right femoral selective angiogram.,3. Closure device the seal the femoral arteriotomy using an Angio-Seal.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: ,The patient with known coronary atherosclerotic heart disease and multiple risk factor of coronary disease, who had her last coronary arteriogram performed in 2004. She ha had complaint of progressive chest discomfort, and ha ongoing risk including current smoking, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia to name a few. The decision wa made to proceed on with percutaneous evaluation and possible intervention given her known disease and the possibility of disease progression.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:, After informed consent wa obtained, The patient wa taken to cardiac catheterization lab where her procedure wa performed. She wa prepped and prepared on the table; after which, her right groin wa locally anesthetized with 1% lidocaine. Then, a 6-French sheath wa inserted into the right femoral artery over a standard 0.035 guide wire. Coronary angiography and left ventricular measurement and angiography were performed using a 6-French JL4 diagnostic catheter to image the left coronary artery. A 6-French JR4 diagnostic catheter to image the right groin and her artery and the saphenous vein graft conduit. Subsequently, a 6-French angled pigtail catheter wa used to measure left ventricular pressure and to perform a power injection, a left ventriculogram at 8 mL per second for a total of 30 mL. At the conclusion of the diagnostic evaluation, the patient had selective arteriography of her right femoral artery, which showed the right femoral artery to be free of significant atherosclerotic plaque. Did have a normal bifurcation into the superficial femoral and profunda femoris artery and to have an arteriotomy that wa in the common femoral artery away from the bifurcation. As such, an initial attempt to advance a Perclose device failed to allow the device descend to _____ tract and into the appropriate position within the artery. As such, the Perclose wa never deployed and wa removed intact over the wire from the system. We then replaced this with a 6-French Angio-Seal which wa used to seal the femoral arteriotomy with achievement of hemostasis. The patient wa subsequently dispositioned back to the MAC Unit where she will complete her bedrest prior to her disposition to home.,HEMODYNAMIC DATA:, Opening aortic pressure 125/60, left ventricular pressure 108/4 with an end-diastolic pressure of 16. There wa no significant gradient across the aortic valve on pullback from the left ventricle. Left ventricular ejection fraction wa 55%. Mitral regurgitation wa le than or equal to 1+. There wa normal wall motion in the RAO projection.,CORONARY ANGIOGRAM:, The left main coronary artery had mild atherosclerotic plaque. The proximal LAD wa 100% occluded. The left circumflex had mild diffuse atherosclerotic plaque. The obtuse marginal branch which operates a an OM-2 had a mid approximately 80% stenosis at a kink in the artery. This appears to be the area of a prior anastomosis, the saphenous vein graft to the OM. This is a very small-caliber vessel and is 1.5-mm in diameter at best. The right coronary artery is dominant. The native right coronary artery had mild proximal and mid atherosclerotic plaque. The distal right coronary artery ha an approximate 40% stenosis. The posterior left ventricular branch ha a proximal 50 to 60% stenosis. The proximal PDA ha a 40 to 50% stenosis. The saphenous vein graft to the right PDA is widely patent. There wa competitive flow noted between the native right coronary artery and the saphenous vein graft to the PDA. The runoff from the PDA is nice with the native proximal PDA and PLV disease a noted above. There is also some retrograde filling of the right coronary artery from the runoff of this graft. The saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending is widely patent. The LAD beyond the distal anastomosis is a relatively small-caliber vessel. There is some retrograde filling that allows some filling into a more proximal diagonal branch. The saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal wa known to be occluded from the prior study in 2004. Overall, this study doe not look markedly different than the procedure performed in 2004.,CONCLUSION:, 100% proximal LAD mild left circumflex disease with an OM that is a small-caliber vessel with an 80% lesion at a kink that is no amenable to percutaneous intervention. The native right coronary artery ha mild to moderate distal disease with moderate PLV and PDA disease. The saphenous vein graft to the OM is known to be 100% occluded. The saphenous vein graft to the PDA and the saphenous vein graft to the LAD are open. Normal left ventricular systolic function.,PLAN:, The plan will be for continued medical therapy and risk factor modification. Aggressive antihyperlipidemic and antihypertensive control. The patient's goal LDL will be at or below 70 with triglyceride level at or below 150, and it is very imperative that the patient stop smoking.,After her bedrest is complete, she will be dispositioned to home, after which, she will be following up with me in the office within 1 month. We will also plan to perform a carotid duplex Doppler ultrasound to evaluate her carotid bruits. ",1.0

Tailor's bunionectomy with metatarsal osteotomy of the left fifth metatarsal.,2.  Excision of nerve lesion with implantation of the muscle belly of the left second interspace.,3.  Excision of nerve lesion in the left third interspace.,ANESTHESIA:  ,Monitored IV sedation with local.,HISTORY:  ,This is a 37-year-old female who present to ABCD's preoperative holding area, n.p.o. since mid night, last night for surgery of her painful left second and third interspaces and her left fifth metatarsal.  The patient ha attempted conservative correction and injection with minimal improvement.  The patient desire surgical correction at this time.  The patient state that her pain ha been increasingly worsening with activity and with time and it is currently difficult for her to ambulate and wear shoes.  At this time, the patient desire surgical intervention and correction.  The risk versus benefit of the procedure have been explained to the patient in detail by Dr. X and consent wa obtained.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After an IV wa instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area, the patient wa taken to the Operating Suite via cart and placed on the operating table in the supine position.  A safety strap wa placed across her waist for protection.,Next, a pneumatic ankle tourniquet wa applied around her left ankle over copious amount of Webril for the patient's protection.  After adequate IV sedation wa administered by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 20 cc of a mixture of 4.5 cc of 1% lidocaine plain, 4.5 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain, and 1 cc of Solu-Medrol per 10 cc dose wa administered to the patient for local anesthesia.  The foot wa then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic manner.  The foot wa then elevated and a tourniquet wa then placed at 230 mmHg after applying Esmarch bandage.  The foot wa then lowered down the operative field and sterile stockinet wa draped.  The stockinet wa then reflected.  Attention wa then directed to the second intermetatarsal interspace.  After testing the anesthesia, a 4 cm incision wa placed using a #10 blade over the dorsal surface of the foot in the second intermetatarsal space beginning from proximal third of the metatarsal distally to and beyond the metatarsal head.  Then, using #15 blade the incision wa deepened through the skin into the subcutaneous tissue.  Care wa taken to identify and avoid or to cauterize any local encountered vascular structures.  Incision wa deepened using the combination of blunt and dull dissection using Mayo scissors, hemostat, and a #15 blade.  The incision wa deepened distally down to the level of the deep transverse metatarsal ligament which wa reflected and exposure of the intermetatarsal space wa appreciated.  The individual branch of the plantar digital nerve were identified extending into the second and third digit plantarly.  These ending were dissected distally and cut at their most distal portions.  Following this, the nerve wa dissected proximally into the common nerve and dissected proximally into the proximal portion of the intermetatarsal space.  Using careful meticulous dissection, there wa noted to a be a enlarged bulbous mass of fiber and nerve tissue embedded with the adipose tissue.  This wa also cut and removed.  The proximal portion of the nerve stump wa identified and care wa taken to suture this into the lumbrical muscle to leave no free nerve ending exposed.  Following this, the interspace wa irrigated with copious amount of sterile saline and interspace explored for any other portion of nerve which may been missed on the previous dissection.  It wa noted that no other portion of the nerve were detectable and the proximal free nerve ending wa embedded and found to be ________ the lumbrical muscle belly.  Following this, the interspace wa packed using iodoform gauze packing and wa closed in layer with the packing extruding from the wound.  Attention wa then directed to the third interspace where in a manner a mentioned before.  A dorsal linear incision which measured 5 cm wa made over the third interspace extending from the proximal portion of the metatarsal distally to the metatarsal head.  Like before, using a combination of blunt and dull dissection, with sharp dissection the incision wa deepened down with care taken to cauterize all retracting vascular structure which were encountered.,The incision wa deepened down to the level of the subcutaneous tissue and then down deeper to the interspace of the third and fourth metatarsal.  The dissection wa deepened distally down to the level of the transverse intermetatarsal ligament, where upon this wa reflected and the nerve fiber to the third and fourth digit plantarly were identified.  These were once again dissected distally out and transected at their most distal portions.  Care wa then taken to dissect the nerve proximally into the proximal metatarsal region.  No other branch of the nerve were identified and the nerve in it entirety along with fibrous tissue encountered in the area wa removed.  The proximal portion of the nerve which remained wa not large enough to suture into lumbrical muscle a wa done in the previous interspace.  Half of the nerve wa transected proximally a wa feasible and no exposed ending wa noted.  Incision wa then flushed and irrigated using sterile saline.  Following this, the incision wound wa packed with iodoform gauze packed and closed in layer using a before #4-0 Vicryl and #4-0 nylon suture.,Following this, attention wa directed to the fifth metatarsal head where a lateral 4 cm incision wa placed along the lateral distal shaft and head of the fifth metatarsal using a fresh #10 blade.  The incision wa then deepened using #15 blade down to the level of the subcutaneous tissue.  Care wa taken to reflect any neurovascular structure which were encountered.  Following this the incision wa deepened down to the level of the periosteum and periosteum wa reflected, using the sharp dissection, to expose the head of the metatarsal along with the neck region.  After adequate exposure of the fifth metatarsal head wa achieved, an oblique incision directed from distal lateral to proximal medial in a sagittal plane wa performed and the head of the fifth metatarsal wa shifted medially.  Following this, an OrthoSorb pin wa retrograded through the fifth metatarsal head into the neck of the fifth metatarsal and wa cut off first with the lateral surface of bone.  OrthoSorb pin wa noted to be intact and the fifth metatarsal head wa in good alignment and position.  Following this, the sagittal saw and the #138 blade were used to provide rasping and smoothing of the sharp acute edge of bone laterally.  Following this, the periosteum wa closed using #4-0 Vicryl and the skin wa closed in layer using #4-0 Vicryl and closed with running subcuticular #4-0 Monocryl suture.  Upon completion of this, the foot wa noted to be in good position with good visual alignment of the fifth metatarsal head and digit.  The incision in foot were then ________ draped in the normal manner using Owen silk, 4 x 4s, Kling, and Kerlix and covered with Coban bandage.  The tourniquet wa then deflated with the total tourniquet time of 103 minute at 230 mmHg and immediate hyperemia wa noted to end digit one through five of the left foot.,The patient wa then transferred to the cart and wa escorted to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital sign stable and vascular status intact.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications.  The patient wa then given prescription for Vicoprofen #30 and Augmentin #14 to be taken twice daily.  The patient wa instructed to followup with Dr. X after the weekend on Tuesday in his office.  The patient also given postoperative instruction and wa placed in a postoperative shoe and instructed to limit weightbearing to the heel only, ice and elevate her foot 20 minute every hour a tolerated.  The patient also instructed to take her medication and prescription a directed.  She wa given the emergency contact numbers.  Postoperative x-ray were taken and the patient wa discharged home in stable condition upon conclusion of this. ",2.0

Gauze throat pack wa placed and the right buccal vestibule wa palpated and area of the abscess wa located.  The abscess cavity wa aspirated using a 5 mL syringe with an 18-gauge needle.  Approximately 1 mL of purulent material wa aspirated that wa placed on aerobic and anaerobic cultures.  Culture swab and the tooth sent to the laboratory for culture and sensitivity testing.,The area in the buccal vestibule wa then opened with approximately 1-cm incision.  Blunt dissection wa then used to open up the abscess cavity and explore the abscess cavity.  A small amount of additional purulence wa drained from it, approximately 1 mL and at this point, tooth #T wa extracted by forceps extraction.  Periosteal elevator wa used to explore the area near the extraction site.  This wa continuous with abscess cavity, so the abscess cavity wa allowed to drain into the extraction site.

2039,"CLINICAL HISTORY:,  A 48-year-old smoker found to have a right upper lobe mass on chest x-ray and is being evaluated for chest pain.  PET scan demonstrated a mass in the right upper lobe and also a mass in the right lower lobe, which were also identified by CT scan.  The lower lobe mass wa approximately 1 cm in diameter and the upper lobe mass wa 4 cm to 5 cm in diameter.  The patient wa referred for surgical treatment.,SPECIMEN:,A.  Lung, wedge biopsy right lower lobe,B.  Lung, resection right upper lobe,C.  Lymph node, biopsy level 2 and 4,D.  Lymph node, biopsy level 7 subcarinal,FINAL DIAGNOSIS:,A.  Wedge biopsy of right lower lobe showing:  Adenocarcinoma, Grade 2, Measuring 1 cm in diameter with invasion of the overlying pleura and with free resection margin.,B.  Right upper lobe lung resection showing:  Adenocarcinoma, grade 2, measuring 4 cm in diameter with invasion of the overlying pleura and with free bronchial margin.  Two (2) hilar lymph node with no metastatic tumor.,C.  Lymph node biopsy at level 2 and 4 showing seven (7) lymph node with anthracosis and no metastatic tumor.,D.  Lymph node biopsy, level 7 subcarinal showing (5) lymph node with anthracosis and no metastatic tumor.,COMMENT:  ,The morphology of the tumor seen in both lobe is similar and we feel that the smaller tumor involving the right lower lobe is most likely secondary to transbronchial spread from the main tumor involving the right upper lobe.  This suggestion is supported by the fact that no obvious vascular or lymphatic invasion is demonstrated and adjacent to the smaller tumor, there is isolated nest of tumor cell within the air spaces.  Furthermore, immunoperoxidase stain for Ck-7, CK-20 and TTF are performed on both the right lower and right upper lobe nodule.  The immunohistochemical result confirm the lung origin of both tumor and we feel that the tumor involving the right lower lobe is due to transbronchial spread from the larger tumor nodule involving the right upper lobe., ",1.0

Nonoperative measure failed to relieve her symptom and surgical intervention wa requested.  We discussed reasonable risks, benefits, and alternative of various treatment options.  Continuation of nonoperative care versus the risk associated with surgery were discussed.  She understood the risk including bleeding, nerve vessel damage, infection, hoarseness, dysphagia, adjacent segment degeneration, continued worsening pain, failed fusion, and potential need for further surgery.  Despite these risks, she felt that current symptom will be best managed operatively.,SUMMARY OF SURGERY IN DETAIL: , Following informed consent and preoperative administration of antibiotics, the patient wa brought to the operating suite.  General anesthetic wa administered.  The patient wa placed in the supine position.  All prominence and neurovascular structure were well accommodated.  The patient wa noted to have pulse in this position.  Preoperative x-ray revealed appropriate level for skin incision.  Ten pound inline traction wa placed via Gardner-Wells tongs and shoulder roll wa placed.  The patient wa then prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  Standard oblique incision wa made over the C6 vertebral body in the proximal nuchal skin crease.  Subcutaneous tissue wa dissected down to the level of the omohyoid which wa transected.  Blunt dissection wa carried out with the trachea and the esophagus in the midline and the carotid sheath in it vital structure laterally.  This wa taken down to the prevertebral fascia which wa bluntly split.  Intraoperative x-ray wa taken to ensure proper levels.  Longus colli wa identified and reflected proximally 3 to 4 mm off the midline bilaterally so that the anterior cervical Trimline retractor could be placed underneath the longus colli, thus placing no new traction on the surrounding vital structures.  Inferior spondylosis wa removed with high-speed bur.  A scalpel and curette wa used to remove the disc.  Decompression wa carried posterior to the posterior longitudinal ligament down to the uncovertebral joint bilaterally.  Disc herniation wa removed from the right posterolateral aspect of the interspace.  High-speed bur wa used to prepare the endplate down to good bleeding bone and preparation for fusion.  Curette and ball tip dissector wa then passed out the foramen and along the ventral aspect of the dura.  No further evidence of compression wa identified.  Hemostasis wa achieved with thrombin-soaked Gelfoam.  Interspace wa then distracted with Caspar pin distraction set gently.  Interspace wa then gently retracted with the Caspar pin distraction set.  An 8-mm allograft wa deemed in appropriate fit.  This wa press fit with demineralized bone matrix and tamped firmly into position achieving excellent interference fit.  The graft wa stable to pull-out forces.  Distraction and traction wa then removed and anterior cervical instrumentation wa completed using a DePuy Trimline anterior cervical plate with 14-mm self-drilling screws.  Plate and screw were then locked to the plate.  Final x-ray revealed proper positioning of the plate, excellent distraction in the disc space, and apposition of the endplate and allograft.  Wounds were copiously irrigated with normal saline.  Omohyoid wa approximated with 3-0 Vicryl.  Running 3-0 Vicryl wa used to close the platysma.  Subcuticular Monocryl and Steri-Strips were used to close the skin.  A deep drain wa placed prior to wound closure.  The patient wa then allowed to awake from general anesthetic and wa taken to the recovery room in stable condition.  There were no intraoperative complications.  All needle and sponge count were correct.  Intraoperative neurologic monitoring wa used throughout the entirety of the case and wa normal. ",2.0

The scope wa then advanced through the pylorus to the ampulla. The ampulla had a markedly abnormal appearance, a it wa enlarged and very prominent. It extended outward with an almost polypoid shape. It had what appeared to be adenomatous-appearing mucosa on the tip. There also wa ulceration noted on the tip of this ampulla. The biliary and pancreatic orifice were identified. This wa located not at the tip of the ampulla, but rather more towards the base. Cannulation wa performed with a Wilson-Cooke TriTome sphincterotome with easy cannulation of the biliary tree. The common bile duct wa mildly dilated, measuring approximately 12 mm. The intrahepatic duct were minimally dilated. There were no filling defect identified. There wa felt to be a possible stricture within the distal common bile duct, but this likely represented an anatomic variant given the abnormal shape of the ampulla. The patient ha no evidence of obstruction based on lab work and clinically. Nevertheless, it wa decided to proceed with brush cytology of this segment. This wa done without any complications. There wa adequate drainage of the biliary tree noted throughout the procedure. Multiple effort were made to access the pancreatic ductal anatomy; however, because of the shape of the ampulla, this wa unsuccessful. Efforts were made to proceed in a long scope position, but still were unsuccessful. Next, biopsy were obtained of the ampulla away from the biliary orifice. Four biopsy were taken. There wa some minor oozing which had ceased by the end of the procedure. The stomach wa then decompressed and the endoscope wa withdrawn.,FINDINGS:,1. Abnormal papilla with bulging, polypoid appearance, and look adenomatous with ulceration on the tip; biopsy taken.,2.

On dilated examination, the patient ha a cup-to-disc ratio in the right eye of 0.4.  Macula, vessels, and periphery were within normal limits.  On the left eye, the patient ha a cup-to-disc ratio of 0.3 and macula vessel and periphery are also within normal limits.  On gonioscopy, the patient show deep anterior chamber angle OU and is open to the ciliary body band 360 degrees.,In conclusion, my initial impression is that Mr. ABC doe not have glaucoma.  He ha fairly symmetric and small cup-to-disc ratio OU.  His intraocular pressure were within normal limit in our office today.  I discussed at length with him the alternative of observation versus continued work-up and testing.  He seemed to understand very well and went with my recommendation to continue observation for now.  We will take fundus photo of his optic nerve for future comparison, but I think given the lack of any strong finding suspicious for glaucoma, we will defer further testing at this time.,Should you have any specific question or any other information that you think that I may not have included in this evaluation, please feel free to contact me.  I have recommended him to follow up with you for continued examination, continued check-ups, and should you find any other abnormal findings, I would be happy to address those again.,Again, thank you for your referral of Mr. ABC.,Sincerely,, ",2.0

She ha no exposure to tuberculosis or syphilis, she ha no mouth or genital ulcers.  She ha no skin rashes.  She ha no connective tissue disorders.,PAST OCULAR HISTORY: , Significant for cataract and glaucoma surgery of the right eye.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , On examination, visual acuity measure hand motion on the right and 20/25 in the left.  There is an afferent pupillary defect on the right.  On examination, there is a right hypertropia.  There is dense anterior chamber inflammation on the right eye with a stagnant aqueous.  There is either neovascularization on the iris or reactive iris vessels, it is difficult to discern.  This seems to be complete iris synechia to the anterior lens capsule.  There is a posterior chamber intraocular lens with an inflammatory debris on the anterior surface.  The anterior chamber appears narrow.  On the left, there is also dense inflammation at 4+ cell.  There is 1+ nuclear sclerosis.  Dilated fundus examination cannot be performed on the right secondary to intense inflammation.  On the left, there is no evidence of active posterior uveitis.  There is some inferior vitreous debris.,ASSESSMENT/PLAN:,  Chronic bilateral recurrent nongranulomatous diffuse uveitis.  Currently, there is very severe right eye inflammation and severe left eye.  I discussed at length with the patient that this will likely take an oral steroid to quite her down.  Since she ha only one seeing eye, I am anxious to obtain a decreased inflammation a soon a possible.  She ha been on oral steroid in the past.  We also discussed, considering the aggressive recurrent nature of this process, it is likely we will have to consider a steroid sparing agent to maintain longer term control of this recurrent process so that we do not use visual acuity in the left.  I anticipate we will likely start methotrexate in the near future.  In this acute phase, I have recommended oral steroid at a dose of 60 mg a day, hourly topical Pred Forte a well a atropine sulfate.  We will watch her closely in clinic.  I am sending a copy of this dictation to her primary care doctor, she said she ha had a negative HLA-B27, rheumatoid factor, and ANA in the past.  At this stage, to be thorough I would ask Dr. X to assist u in repeating her chest x-ray, PPD if not current, and an RPR.  Additionally, in anticipation of need for methotrexate, it would be helpful to have a full liver function profile a well a hepatitis B and hepatitis C. ",1.0

Sutures and staple were removed. The abdomen wa opened. The were some very early stage adhesion that were easy to separate. Dissection wa carried up toward the upper abdomen where the patient wa found to have a stool filled descended colon. This wa retracted caudally to expose the stomach. There were a number of adhesion to the stomach. These were carefully dissected to expose initially the closure over the gastrotomy site. Initially this looked like this wa leaking but it wa actually found to be intact.  The pyloroplasty wa identified and also found to be intact with no evidence of leakage. Further dissection up toward the hiatus revealed an abscess collection. This wa sent for culture and sensitivity and wa aspirated and lavaged. Cavity tracked up toward the hiatus. Stomach itself appeared viable, there wa no necrotic sections. Upper apex of the stomach wa felt to be viable also. I did not pull the stomach and esophagus down into the abdomen from the mediastinum, but placed a sucker up into the mediastinum where additional turbid fluid wa identified. Carefully placed a 10 mm flat Jackson-Pratt drain into the mediastinum through the hiatus to control this area of leakage. Two additional Jackson-Pratt drain were placed essentially through the gastrohepatic omentum. This wa the area that most of the drainage had collected in. As I had previously discussed with Dr. Sageman I did not feel that mobilizing the stomach to redo the anastomosis in the chest would be a recoverable situation for the patient. I therefore did not push to visualize any focal area of the anastomosis with the intent of repair. Once the drain were secured, they were brought out through the anterior abdominal wall and secured with 3-0 silk suture and secured to bulb suction. The midline fascia wa then closed using running #2 Prolene suture bolstered with retention sutures. Subcutaneous tissue wa copiously lavaged and then the skin wa closed with loosely approximated staples. Dry gauze dressing wa placed. The patient tolerated the procedure well, there were no complications. ",2.0

1227,"REASON FOR REFERRAL: , Ms. A is a 60-year-old African-American female with 12 year of education who wa referred for neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. X after she demonstrated mild cognitive deficit on a neuropsychological screening evaluation during a followup appointment with him for stroke in July.  A comprehensive evaluation wa requested to ass current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decision and treatment planning.,RELEVANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION:,  Historical information wa obtained from a review of available medical record and clinical interview with Ms. A.  A summary of pertinent information is presented below.  Please refer to the patient's medical chart for a more complete history.,HISTORY OF PRESENTING PROBLEM:,  Ms. A presented to the ABC Hospital emergency department on 07/26/2009 reporting that after she had woken up that morning she noticed numbness and weakness in her left hand, slurred speech, and left facial droop.  Neurological evaluation with Dr. X confirmed left hemiparesis.  Brain CT showed no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect and that she received TPA and had moderate improvement in left-sided weakness.  These symptom were thought to be due to a right middle cerebral artery stroke.  She wa transferred to the ICU for monitoring.  Ultrasound of the carotids showed 20% to 30% stenosis of the right ICA and 0% to 19% stenosis of the left ICA.  On 07/29/2009, she wa admitted for acute inpatient rehabilitation for the treatment of residual functional deficit of her acute ischemic right MCA/CVA.  At discharge on 08/06/2009, she wa mainly on supervision for all ADLs and walking with a rolling walker, but tolerating increased ambulation with a cane.  She wa discharged home with recommendation for outpatient physical therapy.  She returned to the Sinai ER on 08/2009/2009 due to reported left arm pain, numbness, and weakness, which lasted 10 to 15 minute and she reported that it felt ""just like the stroke.""  Brain CT on 08/2009/2009 wa read a showing ""mild chronic microvascular ischemic change of deep white matter,"" but no acute or significant interval change compared to her previous scan.  Neurological examination with Dr. Y wa within normal limits, but she wa admitted for a more extensive workup.  Due to left arm pain an ultrasound wa completed on her left upper extremity, but it did not show deep vein thrombosis.,Followup CT on 08/10/2009 showed no significant interval change.  MRI could not be completed due to the patient's weight.  She wa discharged on 08/11/2009 in stable condition after it wa determined that this event wa not neurological in origin; however, note that Ms. A referred to this a a second stroke.,Ms. A presented for a followup outpatient neurological evaluation with Dr. X on 09/22/2009, at which time a brief neuropsychological screening wa also conducted.  She demonstrated significant impairment in confrontation naming, abstract verbal reasoning, and visual and verbal memory and thus a more comprehensive evaluation wa suggested due to her intent to return to her full-time work duty.  During the current interview, Ms. A reported that she noticed mild memory problem including some difficultly remembering conversations, events, and at time forgetting to take her medications.  She also reported mild difficulty finding word in conversation, solving novel problem and task (e.g. difficulty learning to use her camcorder), but overall denied significant cognitive deficit in attention, concentration, language or other area of cognitive functioning.  When asked about her return to work, she said that she wa still on light duty due to limited physical activity because of residual left leg weakness.  She reported that no one had indicated to her that she appeared le capable of performing her job duties, but said that she wa also receiving fewer file to process and enter data into the computer at the Social Security Agency that she work at.  Note also that she had some difficulty explaining exactly what her job involved.  She also reported having problem falling asleep at work and that she is working full-time although on light duty.,OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,As mentioned, Ms. A continues to have some residual left leg weakness and continues to use a rolling walker for ambulation, but she reported that her motor functioning had improved significantly.  She wa diagnosed with sleep apnea approximately two year ago and wa recently counseled by Dr. X on the need to use her CPAP because she indicated she never used it at night.  She reported that since her appointment with Dr. X, she ha been using it ""every other night.""  When asked about daytime fatigue, Ms. A initially denied that she wa having any difficulties, but repeatedly indicated that she wa falling asleep at work and thought that it wa due to looking at a computer screen.  She reported at time ""snoring"" and forgetting where she is at and said that a supervisor offered to give her coffee at one point.  She receives approximately two to five hour of sleep per night.  Other current untreated risk factor include obesity and hypercholesterolemia.  Her medical history is also significant for hypertension, asthma, abdominal adenocarcinoma status post hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, colonic benign polyp status post resection, benign lesion of the breast status post lumpectomy, and deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity status post six month of anticoagulation (which she had discontinued just prior to her stroke).,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Aspirin 81 mg daily, Colace 100 mg b.i.d., Lipitor 80 mg daily, and albuterol MDI p.r.n.,SUBSTANCE USE:,  Ms. A denied drinking alcohol or using illicit drugs.  She used to smoke a pack of cigarette per day, but quit five to six year ago.,FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY: , Ms. A had difficulty providing information on familial medical history.  She reported that her mother died three to four year ago from lung cancer.  Her father ha gout and blood clots.  Siblings have reportedly been treated for asthma and GI tumors.  She wa unsure of familial history of other condition such a hypertension, high cholesterol, stroke, etc.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , Ms. A completed high school degree.  She reported that she primarily obtained B's and C's in school.  She received some tutoring for algebra in middle school, but denied ever having been held back a grade failing any class or having any problem with attention or hyperactivity.,She currently work for the Social Security Administration in data processing.

He ha been feeling nervous and anxious.  It seems like when he is feeling stressed he ha more palpitations, sometimes they cause chest pain.  These symptom are not triggered by exertion.  He had similar symptom about 9 or 10 year ago.  At that time he went through a full workup.  Everything ended up being negative and they gave him something that he took for his nerve and he say that helped.  Unfortunately, he doe not remember what it was.  Also over the last three day he ha had some intestinal problems.  He ha had some intermittent nausea and his stool have been loose.

He say his work is definitely contributing to some of his symptom and he feel stressed.  He is leaving for a vacation very soon.  Unfortunately, he is actually leaving Wednesday for XYZ, which put u into a bit of a bind in term of doing testing on him.  My overall opinion is he ha some anxiety related issue and he may also have a touch of gastroenteritis.  A 12-lead EKG wa performed on him in the office today.  This EKG wa compared with the previous EKG contained in the chart from 2006 and I see that these EKGs look very similar with no significant change noted, which is definitely a good news.  I am going to send him to the lab from our office to get the following test done:  Comprehensive metabolic profile, CBC, urinalysis with reflex to culture and we will also get a chest X-ray.  Tomorrow morning I will manage to schedule him for an exercise stress test at Bad Axe Hospital.  We were able to squeeze him in.  His appointment is at 8:15 in the morning.  He is going to have the stress test done in the morning and he will come back to the office in the afternoon for recheck.  I am not going to be here so he is going to see Dr. X.  Dr. X should hopefully be able to call over and speak with the physician who attended the stress test and get a preliminary result before he leaf for XYZ.

She doe not seem to have any specific acute process going on and seemed to feel comfortable after the Ativan wa given, a small quantity wa given to the patient.  Family and daughter specifically did not want to pursue any workup at this point, which at this point I think is reasonable and we will have her follow up with ABC.  She is discharged in stable condition. ",1.0

4262,"REASON FOR REFERRAL:,  The patient wa referred to me by Dr. X of the Clinic due to concern regarding behavioral acting out a well a encopresis.  This is a 90-minute initial intake completed on 10/03/2007.  I met with the patient's mother individually for the entire session.  I reviewed with her the treatment, consent form, a well a the boundary of confidentiality, and she stated that she understood these concepts.,PRESENTING PROBLEMS: , Mother reported that her primary concern in regard to the patient had to do with his oppositionality.  She wa more ambivalent regarding addressing the encopresis.  In regard to his oppositionality, she reported that the onset of his oppositionality wa approximately at 4 year of age, that before that he had been a very compliant and happy child, and that he ha slowly worsened over time.  She noted that the oppositionality occurred approximately after his brother, who ha multiple medical problems, wa born.  At that time, mother had spent 2 month back East with the brother due to his feeding issue and will have to go again next year.  She reported that in term of the behavior that he loses his temper frequently, he argues with her that he defies her authority that she ha to ask him many time to do things, that she ha to repeat instructions, that he ignores her, that he whines, and this is when he is told to do something that he doe not want to do.  She reported that he deliberately annoys other people, that he can be angry and resentful.  She reported that he doe not display these behavior with the father nor doe he display them at home, but they are specific to her.  She reported that her response to him typically is that she repeat what she want him to do many, many times, that eventually she get upset.  She yell at him, talk with him, and try to make him go and do what she want him to do.  Mother also noted that she probably ignores some his misbehaviors.  She stated that the father tends to be more firm and more direct with him, and that, the father sometimes think that the mother is too easy on him.

She reported that he wa seen at the Gastroenterology Department here several year ago, and ha more recently been seen at the Diseases Center, seen by Dr. Y, reported that the last visit wa several month ago, that he is on MiraLax.  He doe sit on the toilet may be 2 time a day, although that is not consistent.  Mother belief that he is probably constipated or impacted again.  He refuse to eat any fiber.  In regard to what happens when he soils, mother basically take full responsibility.  She clean and change his underwear, think of thing that she ha tried, she mostly get frustrated, make negative comments, even though she know that he really cannot help it.  She ha never provided him with any sort of rewards, because she feel that this is something he just need to learn to do.  In regard to other issues, she noted that he becomes frustrated quite easily, especially around homework, that when mother ha to correct him, or when he ha had difficulty doing something that he becomes upset, that he will cry, and he will get angry.

Mother and father have been together since 1997, married in 1999.  The maternal grandmother and grandfather are living and are together, and live in the Central California Coast Area.  There is one maternal aunt, age 33, and then, two adopted maternal aunt and uncle, age 18 and age 13.  In regard to the father's side of the family, the paternal grandparent are divorced.  Grandfather wa in Arkansas, grandmother life in Dos Palos.  The patient doe not see his grandfather.  Mother stated that her relationship with her child wa a described, that he very much stress her out, that she wish that he wa not so defiant, that she find him to be a very stressful child to deal with.  In regard to the relationship with the father, it wa reported that the father tends to leave most of the parenting over to the mother, unless she specifically asks him to do something, and then, he will follow through and do it.  He will step in and back mother up in term of parenting, tell the child not to speak to his mother that way etc.  Mother reported that he doe spend some time with the children, but not a much a mother would like him to, but occasionally, he will go outside and do thing with them.  The mother reported that sometimes she ha a problem in interfering with his parenting, that she step in and defends The patient.  It wa reported that mother stated that she try the parenting technique, primarily of yelling and tried time-out, although her description suggests that she is not doing time-out correctly, a he simply get up from his time-out, and she doe not follow through.  Mother reported that she and the patient are very much alike in temperament, and this ha made thing more difficult.  Mother tends to be stubborn and get angry easily also.  Mother reported becoming fatigued in her parenting, that she let him get away with thing sometimes because she doe not want to punish him all day long, sometimes ignores problem that she probably should not ignore.  There wa reported to be jealousy between The patient and his brother, B.  B evidently ha some heart problem and feeding issues, and because of that, tends to get more attention in term of his medical needs, and that the patient is very jealous of that attention and feel that B is favored and that he get thing that The patient doe not get, and that there is some tension between the brothers.  They do play well together; however, The patient doe tend to be somewhat intrusive, get in his space, and then, B will hit him.  Mother reported that she graduated from high school, went to Community College, and wa an average student.  No learning problems.  Mother ha a history of depression.  She ha currently been taking 100 mg of Zoloft administered by her primary medical doctor.  She is not receiving counseling.  She ha been on the medication for the last 5 years.  Her dosage ha not been changed in a year.  She feel that she is getting more irritable and more angry.  I  encouraged her to see a primary medical doctor.  Mother ha no drug or alcohol history.

He doe have kid over to play at the house.,PREVIOUS COUNSELING:,  Denied.,DIAGNOSTIC SUMMARY AND IMPRESSION: , My impression is that the patient ha a long history of constipation and impaction, which ha been treated medically, but it would appear that the mother ha not followed through consistently with the behavioral component of toilet sitting, increased fiber, regular medication, so that the problem ha likely continued.  She also ha not used any sort of reward a a way to encourage him, in the encopresis.  The patient clearly qualifies for a diagnosis of disruptive behavior disorder, not otherwise specified, and possibly oppositional defiant disorder.  It would appear that mother need help in her parenting, and that she tends to mostly use yelling and anger a a way, and tends to repeat herself a lot, and doe not have a strategy for how to follow through and to deal with defiant behavior.  Also, mother and father, may not be on the same page in term of parenting.,PLAN:,  In term of my plan, I will meet with the child in the next couple of weeks.  I also asked the mother to bring the father in, so he could be involved in the treatment also, and I gave the mother a behavioral checklist to be completed by herself and the father a well a the teacher.,DSM IV DIAGNOSES:  ,AXIS I:  Adjustment disorder with disturbance of conduct (309.3).

He say he is having a lot of palpitations.  He get a fluttering feeling in his chest.  He ha been very tired over two week a well.  His job ha been really getting to him.  He ha been feeling nervous and anxious.  It seems like when he is feeling stressed he ha more palpitations, sometimes they cause chest pain.  These symptom are not triggered by exertion.  He had similar symptom about 9 or 10 year ago.  At that time he went through a full workup.  Everything ended up being negative and they gave him something that he took for his nerve and he say that helped.  Unfortunately, he doe not remember what it was.  Also over the last three day he ha had some intestinal problems.  He ha had some intermittent nausea and his stool have been loose.  He ha been having some really funny green color to his bowel movements.  There ha been no blood in the stool.  He is not having any abdominal pain, just some nausea.

He say his work is definitely contributing to some of his symptom and he feel stressed.  He is leaving for a vacation very soon.  Unfortunately, he is actually leaving Wednesday for XYZ, which put u into a bit of a bind in term of doing testing on him.  My overall opinion is he ha some anxiety related issue and he may also have a touch of gastroenteritis.  A 12-lead EKG wa performed on him in the office today.  This EKG wa compared with the previous EKG contained in the chart from 2006 and I see that these EKGs look very similar with no significant change noted, which is definitely a good news.  I am going to send him to the lab from our office to get the following test done:  Comprehensive metabolic profile, CBC, urinalysis with reflex to culture and we will also get a chest X-ray.  Tomorrow morning I will manage to schedule him for an exercise stress test at Bad Axe Hospital.  We were able to squeeze him in.  His appointment is at 8:15 in the morning.  He is going to have the stress test done in the morning and he will come back to the office in the afternoon for recheck.  I am not going to be here so he is going to see Dr. X.  Dr. X should hopefully be able to call over and speak with the physician who attended the stress test and get a preliminary result before he leaf for XYZ.  Certainly, if something come up we may need to postpone his trip.  We petitioned his medical record from his former physician and with luck we will be able to find out what medication he wa on about nine or ten year ago.  In the meantime I have given him Ativan 0.5 mg one tablet two to three time a day a needed for anxiety.  I talked about Ativan, how it works.  I talked about the side effects.  I told him to use it only a needed and we can see how he is doing tomorrow when he come back for his recheck.  I took him off of work today and tomorrow so he could rest. ",1.0

There wa no ataxia.  She wa able to walk normally.  Reflexes were 2+ throughout.,She had had a CT scan with constant, which per Dr. X's wa unremarkable.  She report that she had a brain MRI two year ago which wa also unremarkable.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN:,  The patient is a delightful 60-year-old chemist from Ukraine who ha had episode of headache with nausea, photophobia, and dizziness since her 20s.  She ha had some immigration problem in recent month and ha experienced increased frequency of her migraine symptoms.  Her diagnosis is consistent with vestibular migraine.  I do not see evidence of multiple sclerosis, M√©ni√®re's disease, or benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.,I talked to her in detail about the importance of following a migraine diet.  I gave her instruction including a list of food times, which worsen migraine.  I reviewed this information for more than half the clinic visit.  I would like to start her on amitriptyline at a dose of 10 mg at time.  She will take Motrin at a dose of 800 mg a needed for her severe headaches.,She will make a diary of her migraine symptom so that we can find any triggering food items, which worsen her symptoms.  I encouraged her to walk daily in order to improve her fitness, which help to reduce migraine symptoms. ",2.0

The pain ha started in the umbilical area and radiated to McBurney's point.  The patient appears to have a significant pain requiring surgical evaluation.  It did not appear that the pain wa pelvic in nature, but more higher up in the abdomen, more towards the appendix.  The patient wa seen by Dr. Y at my request in the ER with me in attendance.  We went over the case.  He decided that she should go to the operating room for evaluation and to have appendix evaluated and probably removed.  The patient on ultrasound had a 0.9 cm ovarian cyst on the right side.  The patient's cyst wa not completely simple and they are concern over the possibility of an abnormality.  The patient state that she ha had chlamydia in the past, but it wa not a pelvic infection more vaginal infection.  The patient ha had hospitalization for this.  The patient therefore signed informed in layman's term with her understanding that perceivable risk and complications, the alternative treatment, the procedure itself and recovery.  All question were answered.  ,PROCEDURE: ,The patient wa seen in the Emergency Room.  In the Emergency Room, there is really no apparent vaginal discharge.  No odor or cervical motion tenderness.  Negative bladder sweep.  Adnexa were without abnormalities.  In the OR, we were able to perform pelvic examination showing a slightly enlarged fibroid uterus about 9 to 10-week size.  The patient had no adnexal fullness.  The patient then underwent an insertion of a uterine manipulator and Dr. X wa in the case at that time and he started the laparoscopic process i.e., inserting the laparoscope.  We then observed under direct laparoscopic visualization with the aid of a camera that there wa pu in and around the uterus.  The both fallopian tube were seen.  There did not appear to be hydrosalpinx.  The ovary were seen.  The left showed some adhesion into the ovarian fossa.  The cul-de-sac had a banded adhesions.  The patient on the right adnexa had a hemorrhagic ovarian cyst, where the cyst wa only about a centimeter enlarged.  The ovary did not appear to have pu in it, but there wa pu over the area of the bladder flap.  The patient's bowel wa otherwise unremarkable.  The liver contained evidence of Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome and prior PID.  The appendix wa somewhat adherent into the retrocecal area and to the mid-quadrant abdominal sidewall on the right.  The case wa then turned over to Dr. Y who wa in the room at that time and Dr. X had left.  The patient's case wa turned over to him.  Dr. Y wa performed an appendectomy following which culture and copious irrigation.  Dr. Y wa then closed the case.  The patient wa placed on antibiotics.

A curvilinear incision wa made below the umbilicus.  Through this incision, the camera port wa able to be placed into the peritoneal cavity under direct visualization.  Once this complete, insufflation wa begun.  Once insufflation wa adequate, additional port were placed in the epigastrium a well a right upper quadrant.  Once all four port were placed, the right upper quadrant wa then explored.  The patient had significant adhesion of omentum and colon to the liver, the gallbladder constituting definitely an acute cholecystitis.  This wa taken down using Bovie cautery to free up visualization of the gallbladder.  The gallbladder wa very thick and edematous and had frank necrosis of most of the anterior gallbladder wall.  Adhesions were further taken down between the omentum, the colon, and the gallbladder slowly starting superiorly and working inferiorly towards the cystic duct area.  Once the adhesion were fully removed, the cholangiogram wa done which did not show any evidence of any common bile duct dilatation or obstruction.  At this point, due to the patient's gallbladder being very necrotic, it wa deemed that the patient should have a drain placed.  The cystic duct and cystic artery were serially clipped and transected.  The gallbladder wa removed from the gallbladder fossa removing the entire gallbladder.  Adequate hemostasis with Bovie cautery wa achieved.  The gallbladder wa then placed into a bag and removed from the peritoneal cavity through the camera port.  A JP drain wa then run through the anterior port and out of one of the trochar site and secured to the skin using 3-0 nylon suture.  Next, the right upper quadrant wa copiously irrigated out using the suction irrigator.  Once this wa complete, the additional port were able to be removed.  The fascial opening at the umbilicus wa reinforced by closing it using a 0 Vicryl suture in a figure-of-8 fashion.  All skin incision were injected using Marcaine 1/4 percent plain.  The skin wa reapproximated further using 4-0 Monocryl suture in a subcuticular technique.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and wa able to be transferred to the recovery room in stable condition. ",2.0

The patient wa breathing supplemental nasal and mask oxygen throughout the procedure.  Saturations and vital sign remained stable throughout.  A flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope wa passed through the right naris.  The vocal cord were visualized.  Secretions in the larynx were a aspirated.  As before, he had a mucocele at the right anterior commissure that did not obstruct the glottic opening.  The port were anesthetized and the trachea entered.  There wa no cough reflex helping explain the propensity to aspiration and mucus plugging.  Tracheal secretion were aspirated.  The main carina were sharp.  However, there were thick, sticky, grey secretion filling the right mainstem bronchus up to the level of the carina.  This wa gradually lavaged clear.  Saline and Mucomyst solution were used to help dislodge remaining plugs.  The airway appeared slightly friable, but were patent after the airway were suctioned.

Submental suction assisted lipectomy (CPT 15876).,ANESTHESIA: , General.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , This patient is a 65-year-old female who ha progressive aging change of the face and neck.  The patient demonstrates the deformity described above and ha requested surgical correction.  The procedure, risks, limitations, and alternative in this individual case have been very carefully discussed with the patient.  The patient ha consented to surgery.,The patient wa brought into the operating room and placed in the supine position on the operating table.  An intravenous line wa started and anesthesia wa maintained throughout the case.  The patient wa monitored for cardiac, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation continuously.,The hair wa prepared and secured with rubber band and micropore tape along the incision line.  A marking pen had been used to outline the area of the incisions, which included the preauricular area to the level of the tragus, the post-tragal region, the post auricular region and into the hairline.  In addition, the incision wa marked in the temporal area in the event of a temporal lift, then across the coronal scalp for the forehead lift.  The incision wa marked in the submental crease for the submental lipectomy and liposuction.  The incision in the post auricular area extended up on the posterior aspect of the ear and ended near the occipital hairline.,The area to be operated on were injected with 1% Lidocaine containing 1:100,000 Epinephrine.  This provided local anesthesia and vasoconstriction.  The total of Lidocaine used throughout the procedure wa maintained at no more than 500mg.,SUBMENTAL SUCTION ASSISTED LIPECTOMY: , The incision wa made, a previously outlined, in the submental crease in a transverse direction, through the skin and subcutaneous tissue, and hemostasis wa obtained with bipolar cautery.  A Metzenbaum scissors wa used to elevate the area in the submental region for about 2 or 3cm and making radial tunnel from the angle of the mandible all the way to the next angle of the mandible.  4mm liopsuction cannula wa then introduced along these previously outlined tunnel into the jowl on both side and down top the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid laterally and just past the thyroid notch interiorly.  The tunnel were enlarged with a 6mm flat liposuction cannula.,Then with the Wells-Johnson liposuction machine 27-29 inch of underwater mercury suction wa accomplished in all tunnels.  Care wa taken not to turn the opening of the suction cannula up to the dermis, but it wa rotated in and out taking a symmetrical amount of fat from each area.  A similar procedure wa performed with the 4 mm cannula cleaning the area.  Bilateral area were palpated for symmetry, and any remaining fat wa then suctioned directly.,A triangular wedge of anterior platysma border wa cauterized and excised at the cervical mental angle.  A plication stitch of 3-0 Vicryl wa placed.,When a satisfactory visible result had been accomplished from the liposuction, the inferior flap wa then advanced over anteriorly and the overlying skin excised in an incremental fashion.  5-0 plain catgut wa used for closure in a running interlocking fashion.  The wound wa cleaned at the end, dried, and Mastisol applied.  Then tan micropore tape wa placed for support to the entire area.,FACE LIFT: , After waiting approximately 10-15 minute for adequate vasoconstriction the post auricular incision wa started at the earlobe and continued up on the posterior aspect of the ear for approximately 2cm just superior to the external auditory canal.  A gentle curve wa then made, and again the incision wa carried down to and into the posterior hairline paralleling the hair follicle and directed posteriorly towards the occipital region.  A preauricular incision wa carried into the natural crease superior to the tragus, curved posterior to the tragus bilaterally then brought out inferiorly in the natural crease between the lobule and preauricular skin.  The incision wa made in the temporal area beveling parallel with the hair follicles.  (The incision had been designed with curve underneath the sideburn in order to maintain the sideburn hair location and then curved posteriorly.),The plane of dissection in the hairbearing area wa kept deep to the root of the hair follicle and superficial to the fascia of the temporalis muscle and sternocleidomastoid.  The dissection over the temporalis muscle wa continued anteriorly towards the anterior hairline and underneath the frontalis to the supraorbital rim.  At the superior level of the zygoma and at the level of the sideburn, dissection wa brought more superficially in order to avoid the nerve and vessel in the areas, specifically the frontalis branch of the facial nerve.,The facial flap were then elevated with both blunt and sharp dissection with the Kahn facelift dissecting scissors in the post auricular region to pas the angle of the mandible.  This area of undermining wa connected with an area of undermining starting with the temporal region extending in the preauricular area of the cheek out to the jowl.  Great care wa taken to direct the plane of dissecting superficial to the parotid fascia or SMAS.  The entire dissection wa carried in a radial fashion from the ear for approximately 4cm at the lateral canthal area to 8-10cm in the neck region.  When the area of dissection had been connected carefully, hemostasis wa obtained and all area inspected.  At no point were muscle fiber or major vessel or nerve encountered in the dissection.,The SMAS wa sharply incised in a semilunar fashion in front of the ear and in front of the anterior border of the SCM.  The SMAS flap wa then advanced posteriorly and superiorly.  The SMAS wa split at the level of the earlobe, and the inferior portion wa sutured to the mastoid periosteum.  The excess SMAS wa trimmed and excised from the portion anterior to the auricle.  The SMAS wa then imbricated with 2-0 Surgidak interrupted sutures.,The area wa then inspected for any bleeding point and careful hemostasis obtained.  The flap were then rotated and advanced posteriorly and then superiorly, and incremental cut were made and the suspension point in the pre and post auricular area were done with 2-0 Tycron suture.  The excess and redundant amount of skin were then excised and trimmed cautiously so a not to cause any downward pull on the ear lobule or any stretching of the scar in the healing period.  Skin closure wa accomplished in the hairbearing area with 5-0 Nylon in the preauricular tuft and 4-0 Nylon interrupted in the post auricular area.  The pre auricular area wa closed first with 5-0 Dexon at the ear lobules, and 6-0 Nylon at the lobules, and 5-0 plain catgut in a running interlocking fashion.  5-0 Plain catgut wa used in the post auricular area a well, leaving ample room for serosanguinous drainage into the dressing.  The post tragal incisin wa closed with interrupted and running interlocking 5-0 plain catgut.  The exact similar procedure wa repeated on the left side.,At the end of this procedure, all flap were inspected for adequate capillary filling or any evidence of hematoma formation.  Any small amount of fluid wa expressed post-auricularly.  A fully perforated bulb suction drain wa placed under the flap and exited posterior to the hairline on each side prior to the suture closure.  A Bacitracin impregnated nonstick dressing wa cut to conform to the pre and post auricular area and placed over the incision lines.,ABD padding over 4X4 gauze wa used to cover the pre and post auricular areas.  This wa wrapped around the head in a vertical circumferential fashion and anchored with white micropore tape in a non-constricting but secured fashion.  The entire dressing complex wa secured with a pre-formed elastic stretch wrap device.  All branch of the facial nerve were checked and appeared to be functioning normally.,The procedure were completed without complication and tolerated well.  The patient left the operating room in satisfactory condition.  A follow-up appointment wa scheduled, routine post-op medication prescribed, and post-op instruction given to the responsible party.,The patient wa released to home in satisfactory condition. ",2.0

After induction of IV sedation the left hand wa anesthetized suitable for carpal tunnel release; 10 cc of a mixture of 1% Xylocaine and 0.5% Marcaine wa injected in the distal forearm and proximal palm suitable for carpal tunnel surgery.  Routine prep and drape wa employed.  Arm wa exsanguinated by mean of elevation of Esmarch elastic tourniquet and tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg pressure.  Hand wa positioned palm up in the lead hand-holder.  A short curvilinear incision about the base of the thenar eminence wa made.  Skin wa sharply incised.  Sharp dissection wa carried down to the transverse carpal ligament and this wa carefully incised longitudinally along it ulnar margin.  Care wa taken to divide the entire length of the transverse retinaculum including it distal insertion into deep palmar fascia in the midpalm.  Proximally the antebrachial fascia wa released for a distance of 2-3 cm proximal to the wrist crease to insure complete decompression of the median nerve.  Retinacular flap wa retracted radially to expose the content of the carpal canal.  Median nerve wa identified, seen to be locally compressed with moderate erythema and mild narrowing.  Locally adherent tenosynovium wa present and this wa carefully dissected free.  Additional tenosynovium wa dissected from the flexor tendons, individually stripping and peeling each tendon in sequential order so a to debulk the content of the carpal canal.  Epineurotomy and partial epineurectomy were carried out on the nerve in the area of mild constriction to relieve local external scarring of the epineurium.  When this wa complete retinacular flap wa laid loosely in place over the content of the carpal canal and skin only wa closed with interrupted 5-0 nylon horizontal mattress sutures.  A syringe with 3 cc of Kenalog-10 and 3 cc of 1% Xylocaine using a 25 gauge short needle wa then selected; 1 cc of this mixture wa injected into the third finger A1 and A2 pulley tendon sheath using standard trigger finger injection technique; 1 cc wa injected into the fourth finger A1/A2 pulley tendon sheath using standard tendon sheath injection technique; 1 cc wa injected into the Dupuytren's nodule in the midpalm to relieve local discomfort.  Routine postoperative hand dressing with well-padded, well-molded volar plaster splint and lightly compressive Ace wrap wa applied.  Tourniquet wa deflated.  Good vascular color and capillary refill were seen to return to the tip of all digits.  Patient discharged to the ambulatory recovery area and from there discharged home.

These were small white spotty looking lesion and were not confirmed to be tumor implants, but were suspicious to be multiple area of tumor.  Based on this, the wedge of the tumor that were easily palpable were excised with complete excision of all palpable lesions.  Following this, the patient had a 32-French chest tube placed in the anteroapical position.  A 19-French Blake wa placed in the posterior apical position.  The patient had the intercostal space reapproximated with #2-0 Vicryl suture, and the lung wa allowed to be re-expanded under direct visualization.  Following this, the chest tube were placed to Pleur-evac suction and the auscultatory triangle wa closed with 2-0 Vicryl sutures.  The deeper tissue wa closed with 3-0 Vicryl suture, and the skin wa closed with running 4-0 Monocryl suture in a subcuticular fashion.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and had no complications. ",2.0
3994,"XYZ,RE:  ABC,MEDICAL RECORD#:  123,Dear Dr. XYZ:,I saw ABC back in Neuro-Oncology Clinic today.  He come in for an urgent visit because of increasing question about what to do next for his anaplastic astrocytoma.,Within the last several days, he ha seen you in clinic and once again discussed whether or not to undergo radiation for his left temporal lesion.  The patient ha clearly been extremely ambivalent about this therapy for reason that are not immediately apparent.  It is clear that his MRI is progressing and that it seems unlikely at this time that anything other than radiation would be particularly effective.  Despite repeatedly emphasizing this; however, the patient still is worried about potential long-term side effect from treatment that frankly seem unwarranted at this particular time.,After seeing you in clinic, he and his friend again wanted to discus possible change in the chemotherapy regimen.  They came in with a list of eight possible agent that they would like to be administered within the next two weeks.  They then wanted another MRI to be performed and they were hoping that with the use of this type of approach, they might be able to induce another remission from which he can once again be spared radiation.,From my view, I noticed a man whose language ha deteriorated in the week since I last saw him.  This is very worrisome.  Today, for the first time, I felt that there wa a definite right facial droop a well.  Therefore, there is no doubt that he is becoming symptomatic from his growing tumor.  It suggests that he is approaching the end of his compliance curve and that the thing may rapidly deteriorate in the near future.,Emphasizing this once again, in addition, to recommending steroid I once again tried to convince him to undergo radiation.  Despite an hour, this again amazingly wa not possible.  It is not that he doe not want treatment, however.  Because I told him that I did not feel it wa ethical to just put him on the radical regimen that him and his friend devised, we compromised and elected to go back to Temodar in a low dose daily type regimen.  We would plan on giving 75 mg/sq m everyday for 21 day out of 28 days.  In addition, we will stop thalidomide 100 mg/day.  If he tolerates this for one week, we then agree that we would institute another one of the medication that he listed for us.  At this stage, we are thinking of using Accutane at that point.,While I am very uncomfortable with this type of approach, I think a long a he is going to be monitored closely that we may be able to get away with this for at least a reasonable interval.  In the spirit of compromise, he again consented to be evaluated by radiation and this time, seemed more resigned to the fact that it wa going to happen sooner than later.  I will look at this a a positive sign because I think radiation is the one therapy from which he can get a reasonable response in the long term.,I will keep you apprised of followups.  If you have any question or if I could be of any further assistance, feel free to contact me.,Sincerely, ",2.0

KYPHON Balloon Kyphoplasty at T12 and L1evels Insertion of KYPHON HV-R bone cement under low pressure at T12 and L1 levels.,2.  Bone biopsy (medically necessary).,ANESTHESIA:, General,COMPLICATIONS:, None,BLOOD LOSS:, Minimal,INDICATIONS:,  Mrs. Smith is a 75-year-old female who ha had severe back pain that began approximately three month ago and is debilitating.  She ha been unresponsive to nonoperative treatment modality including bed rest and analgesics.  She present with and is on medication therapy for COPD, diabetes and hypertension (other co-morbidities may be present upon admission and should be documented in the operative note).,Radiographic imaging including MRI confirms multiple compression fracture of the thoracolumbar spine including T12, L1 and L2.  In addition to the fractures, she present with kyphotic posture.  Films on 1/04 demonstrated L1 and L2 osteoporotic fractures.  Films on 2/04 demonstrated increased loss of height at L1.  Films on 3/04 demonstrated a new compression fracture at T12 and further collapse of L1.  The L2 fracture is documented on radiographic study a being chronic and a year or more old.  The T12 fracture ha the most significant kyphotic deformity.  Based on these findings, we have decided to perform KYPHON Balloon Kyphoplasty on the L1 and T12 fractures.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient wa brought to the operating room/radiology suite and general anesthesia/local sedation with endotracheal intubation wa performed.  The patient wa positioned prone on the Jackson table.  The back wa prepped and draped.  The image intensifier (C-arm) wa brought into position and the T12 pedicle were identified and marked with a skin marker.  In view of the collapse of T12, a transpedicular approach to the vertebral body wa appropriate.  An 11-gauge needle wa advanced through the T12 pedicle to the junction of the pedicle and vertebral body on the right side.  Positioning wa confirmed on the AP and lateral plane.  Following satisfactory placement of the needle, the stylet wa removed.  A guide pin wa inserted through the 11g to a point 3mm from the anterior cortex.  AP and lateral image were taken to verify position and trajectory.  Alongside of the guide pin a 1-cm paramedian incision wa made.  The needle wa then removed leaving the guide pin in place.  The osteointroducer wa placed over the guide pin and advanced through the pedicle.  Once I wa at the junction of the pedicle and the vertebral body, a lateral image wa taken to insure that the cannula wa positioned approximately 1cm past the vertebral body wall.  Through the cannula, a drill wa advanced into the vertebral body under fluoroscopic guidance toward the anterior cortex, creating a channel.  The anterior cortex wa probed with the guide pin to ensure no perforation in the anterior cortex.  After completing the entry into the vertebral body, a 15 mm inflatable bone tamp wa inserted through the cannula and advanced under fluoroscopic guidance into the vertebral body near the anterior cortex.  The radiopaque marker band on the bone tamp were identified using AP and lateral images.  The above sequence of instrument placement wa then repeated on the left side of the T12 vertebral body.  Once both bone tamp were in position, they were inflated to 0.5 cc and 50 psi.  Expansion of the bone tamp wa done sequentially in increment of 0.25 to 0.5 cc of contrast, with careful attention being paid to the inflation pressure and balloon position.  The inflation wa monitored with AP and lateral imaging.  The final balloon volume wa 3.5 cc on the right side and 3 cc on the left.  There wa no breach of the lateral wall or anterior cortex of the vertebral body.  Direct reduction of the fracture wa achieved, end plate movement wa noted and approximately 5 mm of height restoration wa achieved.  Under fluoroscopic imaging, and the use of the bone void fillers, internal fixation wa achieved through a low-pressure injection of KYPHON HV-R bone cement.  The cavity wa filled with a total volume of 3.5 cc on the right side and 3 cc on the left side.  Once the bone cement had hardened, the cannula were then removed.,At this time, we proceeded to perform a balloon kyphoplasty at L1 using the same sequence of step a on T12.  An entry needle wa placed bilaterally through the pedicle into the vertebral body, a cortical window wa created, inflation of the bone tamp directly reduced the fracture, the bone tamp were removed, and internal fixation by bone void filler insertion wa achieved.  Throughout the procedure, AP and lateral imaging monitored positioning.,Post-procedure, all incision were closed with sutures.  The patient wa kept in the prone position for approximately 10 minute post cement injection.  She wa then turned supine, monitored briefly and returned to the floor.  She wa moving both her lower extremity at this time.,Throughout the procedure, there were no intraoperative complications.  Estimated blood loss wa minimal. ",2.0

He wa worked by the neurologist, Dr. X, and found to have cervical spondylosis with myelopathy.  I wa consulted and elected to do a lumbar and cervical myelogram CT scan, which showed lumbar stenosis but also cervical stenosis with more pathology anteriorly than posteriorly.  The patient had worst disease at level C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6.  The patient wa significantly weak and almost quadriparetic, stronger on the right side than on the left side.  I thought that surgery wa indicated to prevent progressive neurological deterioration, a well a to prevent a central cord syndrome if the patient were to get into a motor vehicle accident or simply fall.  Conservative management wa not an option.  The patient wa preoped and consented, and wa medically cleared.  I discussed the indications, risks, and benefit of the surgery with the patient and the patient's family.  The risk of bleeding, hoarseness, swallowing difficulty, pseudoarthrosis a well a plate migration and hardware failure were all discussed with the patient.  An informed consent wa obtained from the patient a such.  He wa brought into the OR today for the operative procedure.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient wa brought into the OR, intubated, and given a general anesthetic.  Intubation wa done under C-spine precautions.  The patient received preoperative vancomycin and Decadron.  He wa hooked up to the SSEP apparatus and had poor baseline and delays.,With a large a shoulder roll, I extended the patient's neck, and landmark incision in crease in the right upper neck, and the area wa then prepped and sterilely draped.  All the line had been put in and the arm were padded.,Using a knife and cautery, I took the incision down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue and arrived at the cervical spine.  Prominent osteophyte at C5-C6 wa noted, lesser at C4-C5.  Intraoperative x-ray confirmed our levels, and we were fully exposed from C3-C6.,Trimline retractor were put in, and I cut the disc out a well a removed the superficial hyperstatic bone and osteophytes.,With the drill, I performed a superficial discectomy and endplate resection, curetting the endplate a I went.  I then brought in the microscope, under the microscopic guidance, firmly removed the end plate and drilled through the posterior longitudinal ligament to decompress the spinal cord.  Worst finding at C3-C4 followed C5-C6 and then C4-C5.  Excellent thecal sac decompression wa achieved and foraminal decompression wa also achieved.  With change in intraoperative monitoring, a microscope wa used for this decompressive procedure.,The patient wa very oozy throughout this procedure, and during the decompression part, the oozing wa constant.  This wa partly due to the patient's cancellous bone, but he had been on aspirin which wa stopped only 2 day ago, and the option wa not available to wait 2 to 3 week which would have made this man worse simply over time.  I thus elected to give him DDAVP, platelets, and used Horsley bone wax for excellent hemostasis.  This took literally half-an-hour to an hour and added to the complexity and difficulty of this case.  Eventually, with blood pressure controlled and all the other parameter under control, bleeding wa somewhat slow.,I then selected two 10 and one 9-mm cadaveric allograft, which had soaking in bacitracin solution.  These were trimmed to the desired dimensions, and under slight distraction, these were tapped into position.  Excellent graft alignment wa achieved.,I now brought in a DePuy titanium eagle plate, and I fixed it to the spine from C3 to C6.  Fourteen millimeter screw were used; all the screw were tightened and torqued.  The patient's bone quality wa poor, but the screw did torque appropriately.  I inspected the plate, controlled the hemostasis, assessed post-fixation x-ray, and wa really happy with the screw length and the overall alignment.,The wound wa irrigated with antibiotic solution; a Jackson-Pratt drain 10-French wa put in with trocar.  Decision wa made to start the closure.  So, I closed the platysma with 3-0 Vicryl and used staple for the skin.  A simple Primapore or Medpore dressing wa applied.  The patient wa extubated in the OR and taken to the PSU in stable medical condition.,When I saw the patient in the ICU, he wa awake, alert, and moving all four extremities, somewhat weak on the left side.  He had done well from the surgery.  Blood loss wa 350 cc.  All instrument, needle, and sponge count were correct.  No complications, no change in intraoperative monitoring.  No specimen were sent.,The patient's wife wa spoken to and fully appraised of the intraoperative finding and the expected prognosis.  The patient will be kept n.p.o. tonight and will gradually advance his diet, and also will gradually advance his activity.  I will keep him on Decadron and keep the collar on.  I do not think there is need for halo rest.  We will be obtaining formal C-spine film in the morning.  Prognosis is guarded but favorable at this time. ",1.0

On reviewing this pathology, it is mostly likely DCIS.  The risk and benefit of the procedure were explained to the patient who appeared to understand and agreed to proceed.  The patient desired MammoSite Radiation Therapy; therefore, the sentinel lymph node biopsy wa incorporated into the procedure.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL,The patient wa taken to the operating room, placed in supine position, and general LMA anesthesia wa administered.  She wa prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Prior to the procedure, she underwent nuclear medicine injection with technetium-99 and methylene blue.  Incision wa made of the area of great uptake and the axilla and taken through the subcutaneous tissue with electric Bovie cautery.  Two sentinel lymph node were identified, one wa blue and hot and the other wa just hot.  These were sent to Pathology for touch prep.  Adequate hemostasis wa obtained.  The wound wa packed and attention wa turned to the left breast.  Ultrasound wa used to identify the marker and the mass within the breast and create an adequate anterior skin flap.  An elliptical incision wa made roughly at approximately the 3 o'clock position secondary to subcutaneous tissue with electric Bovie cautery.  The mass wa dissected off the surrounding tissue using Bovie cautery down to the level of the pectoralis fascia, which wa incorporated within the specimen.  The specimen wa completely removed and marked **** double deep, and a mini C-arm wa used to confirm this.  The marker wa well localized within the center of the specimen.  The fascia wa then elevated off of the pectoralis muscle and closed loosely with the interrupted 2-0 Vicryl suture to create a nice spherical cavity for the MammoSite radiation catheter.  The wound wa then closed with a deep layer of interrupted 3-0 Vicryl followed by 3-0 Vicryl subcuticular stitch and 4-0 running Monocryl.  The axillary wound wa closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl and a running 4-0 Monocryl.  Steri-Strips were applied.

The left upper extremity wa prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.  On examination of the left elbow, there wa presence of thickening of the bursal sac.  There wa a couple of millimeter opening of skin breakdown from where the serous drainage wa noted.  An incision wa made midline of the olecranon bursa with an elliptical incision around the open wound, which wa excised with skin.  The incision wa carried proximally and distally.  The olecranon bursa wa significantly thickened and scarred.  Excision of the olecranon bursa wa performed.  There wa significant evidence of thickening of the bursa with some evidence of adhesions.  Satisfactory olecranon bursectomy wa performed.  The wound margin were debrided.  The wound wa thoroughly irrigated with Pulsavac irrigation lavage system mixed with antibiotic solution.  There wa no evidence of a loose body.  There wa no bleeding or drainage.

The carina wa in the midline and sharp.  Moving directly to the right side, the right upper and middle lower lobe were examined and found to be free of obstructions.  Aspiration wa carried out for backlog ________ examination.  We then moved to left side, left upper lobe.  There wa a tumor mass located in the lingula of the left lobe and left lower lobe found free of obstruction.  No anatomic lesion were demonstrated.  The patient wa prepared for left thoracotomy rotated to his right side with a double lumen endotracheal tube in place with an NG tube and a Foley catheter.  After proper position, utilizing Betadine solution, they were draped.  A posterolateral left thoracotomy incision wa performed.  Hemostasis wa secured with electrocoagulation.  The chest wall muscle wa then divided over the sixth rib.  The periosteum of the sixth rib wa then removed superiorly and the pleural cavity wa entered carefully.  At this time, the mass wa felt in the left upper lobe, which measure greater than 3 cm by palpation.  We examined the superior mediastinum.  No lymph node were demonstrated a well a in the anterior mediastinum.  Direction wa then moved to the fascia where by utilizing sharp and blunt dissection, lingual artery wa separated into the left upper lobe.  Casual dissection wa carried out with superior segmental artery and left lower lobe wa examined.,Dissection wa carried out around the pulmonary artery thus exposing the posterior artery to the left upper lobe.  Direction wa carried out to the superior pulmonary vein and utilizing sharp and blunt dissection the entire superior pulmonary vein wa separated from the surrounding tissue.  From the top side, the bronchus wa then separated away from the pulmonary artery anteriorly, thus exposing the apical posterior artery, which wa short.  Tumor mass wa close to the artery at this time.  We then directed ourselves once again to the lingual artery which wa doubly ligated and cut free.  The posterior artery of the superior branch wa doubly ligated and cut free also.  At this time, the bronchus of the left upper lobe wa encountered in the fissure on palpation to separate the upper lobe bronchus from lower lobe bronchus and the area wa accomplished.  We then moved anteriorly to doubly ligate the pulmonary vein using #00 silk suture for ligation and a transection #00 silk suture wa used to fixate the vein.  Using sharp and blunt dissection, the bronchus through the left upper lobe wa freed proximal.  Using the TA 50, the bronchus wa then cut free allowing the lung to fall superiorly at which time direction wa carried out to the pulmonary artery where the tumor wa in close proximity at this time.  A Potts clamp arterial wa then placed over the artery and shaving off the tumor and the apical posterior artery wa then accomplished.  The anterior artery wa seen in the clamp also and wa separated and ligated and separated.  At this time, the entire tumor in the left upper lobe wa then removed.  ,Direction wa carried to the suture where #000 silk wa used a a running suture over the pulmonary artery and wa here doubly run and tied in place.  The clamp wa then removed.  No bleeding wa seen at this time.  Lymph node were then removed from the sump of the separation between the upper lobe and the lower lobe and sent for separate pathology.  We then carried out incision in the inferior pulmonary ligament up to the pulmonary vein allowing the lung to reexpand to it normal position.  At this time, two chest tube #28 and #32 were placed anteriorly and posteriorly to fixate the skin using raw silk suture.  The chest cavity wa then closed.

The patient understood the informed consent and desired to have the procedure performed.,SEDATION: , The patient wa given conscious sedation and monitored throughout the procedure.  Oxygenation wa given.  The patient's oxygenation and vital sign were closely followed to ensure the safety of the administration of the drugs.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient remained awake throughout the procedure in order to interact and give feedback.  The x-ray technician wa supervised and instructed to operate the fluoroscopy machine.  The patient wa placed in the prone position on the treatment table with a pillow under the abdomen to reduce the natural lumbar lordosis.  The skin over and surrounding the treatment area wa cleaned with Betadine.  The area wa covered with sterile drapes, leaving a small window opening for needle placement.  Fluoroscopy wa used to identify the boney landmark of the spine and the planned needle approach.  The skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle within the planned approach were anesthetized with 1% Lidocaine.  With fluoroscopy, a Teflon coated needle, ***, wa gently guided into the region of the Medial Branch nerve from the Dorsal Ramus of ***.  Specifically, each needle tip wa inserted to the bone at the groove between the transverse process and superior articular process on lumbar vertebra, or for sacral vertebra at the lateral-superior border of the posterior sacral foramen.  Needle localization wa confirmed with AP and lateral radiographs.,The following technique wa used to confirm placement at the Medial Branch nerves.  Sensory stimulation wa applied to each level at 50 Hz; paresthesia were noted at,*** volts.  Motor stimulation wa applied at 2 Hz with 1 millisecond duration; corresponding paraspinal muscle twitching without extremity movement wa noted at *** volts.,Following this, the needle Trocar wa removed and a syringe containing 1% lidocaine wa attached.  At each level, after syringe aspiration with no blood return, 1cc 1% lidocaine wa injected to anesthetize the Medial Branch nerve and surrounding tissue.

Biceps anchor is intact (series #105 image #4-7; series #102 image #10-22).,There is a very large Hill-Sachs fracture, involving almost the entire posterior half of the humeral head (series #102 image #13-19). This is associated with a large inferior bony Bankart lesion that measure approximately 15 x 18mm in AP and craniocaudal dimension with impaction and fragmentation (series #104 image #10-14; series #102 image #18-28). There is medial and inferior displacement of the fragment. There are multiple interarticular bodies, some of which may be osteochondromatous and some may be osseous measuring up to 8mm in diameter.

4544,"OPERATIONS,1.  Mitral valve repair using a quadrangular resection of the P2 segment of the posterior leaflet.,2.  Mitral valve posterior annuloplasty using a Cosgrove Galloway Medtronic fuser band.,3.  Posterior leaflet abscess resection.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General endotracheal anesthesia,TIMES:  ,Aortic cross-clamp time wa ** minutes.  Cardiopulmonary bypass time total wa ** minutes.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risk and benefit of the aforementioned procedure, the patient wa taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia wa administered.  Next, the patient's chest and leg were prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion.  A #10-blade scalpel wa used to make a midline median sternotomy incision.  Dissection wa carried down to the level of the sternum using Bovie electrocautery.  The sternum wa opened with a sternal saw, and full-dose heparinization wa given.  Next, the chest retractor wa positioned.  The pericardium wa opened with Bovie electrocautery and pericardial stay suture were positioned.  We then prepared to place the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass.  A 2-0 Ethibond double pursestring wa placed in the ascending aorta.  Through this wa passed our aortic cannula and connected to the arterial side of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine.  Next, double cannulation with venous cannula wa instituted.  A 3-0 Prolene pursestring wa placed in the right atrial appendage.  Through this wa passed our SEC cannula.  This wa connected to the venous portion of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine in a Y-shaped circuit.  Next, a 3-0 Prolene pursestring wa placed in the lower border of the right atrium.  Through this wa passed our inferior vena cava cannula.  This wa likewise connected to the Y connection of our venous cannula portion.  We then used a 4-0 U-stitch in the right atrium for our retrograde cardioplegia catheter, which wa inserted.  Cardiopulmonary bypass wa instituted.  Metzenbaum scissors were used to dissect out the SVC and IVC, which were subsequently encircled with umbilical tape.  Sondergaard's groove wa taken down.  Next, an antegrade cardioplegia needle and associated sump were placed in the ascending aorta.  This wa connected appropriately a wa the retrograde cardioplegia catheter.  Next, the aorta wa cross-clamped, and antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia wa infused so a to arrest the heart in diastole.  Next a #15-blade scalpel wa used to open the left atrium.  The left atrium wa decompressed with pump sucker.  Next, our self-retaining retractor wa positioned so a to bring the mitral valve up into view.  Of note wa the fact that the mitral valve P2 segment of the posterior leaflet had an abscess associated with it.  The border of the P2 segment abscess were defined by using a right angle to define the chordae which were encircled with a 4-0 silk.  After doing so, the P2 segment of the posterior leaflet wa excised with a #11-blade scalpel.  Given the laxity of the posterior leaflet, it wa decided to reconstruct it with a 2-0 Ethibond pledgeted suture.  This wa done so a to reconstruct the posterior annular portion.  Prior to doing so, care wa taken to remove any debris and abscess-type material.  The pledgeted stitch wa lowered into place and tied.  Next, the more anterior portion of the P2 segment wa reconstructed by running a 4-0 Prolene stitch so a to reconstruct it.  This wa done without difficulty.  The apposition of the anterior and posterior leaflet wa confirmed by infusing solution into the left ventricle.  There wa noted to be a small amount of central regurgitation.  It wa felt that this would be corrected with our annuloplasty portion of the procedure.  Next, 2-0 non-pledgeted Ethibond suture were placed in the posterior portion of the annulus from trigone to trigone in interrupted fashion.  Care wa taken to go from trigone to trigone.  Prior to placing these sutures, the annulus wa sized and noted to be a *** size for the Cosgrove-Galloway suture band ring from Medtronic.  After, a mentioned, we placed our interrupted suture in the annulus, and they were passed through the CG suture band.  The suture band wa lowered into position and tied in place.  We then tested our repair and noted that there wa very mild regurgitation.  We subsequently removed our self-retaining retractor.  We closed our left atriotomy using 4-0 Prolene in a running fashion.  This wa done without difficulty.  We de-aired the heart.  We then gave another round of antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia in warm fashion.  The aortic cross-clamp wa removed, and the heart gradually resumed electromechanical activity.  We then removed our retrograde cardioplegia catheter from the coronary sinus and buttressed this site with a 5-0 Prolene.  We placed 2 ventricular and 2 atrial pacing lead which were brought out through the skin.  The patient wa gradually weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass and our venous cannula were removed.  We then gave full-dose protamine; and after noting that there wa no evidence of a protamine reaction, we removed our aortic cannula.  This site wa buttressed with a 4-0 Prolene on an SH needle.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  We placed a mediastinal #32-French chest tube a well a a right chest Blake drain.  The mediastinum wa inspected for any sign of bleeding.  There were none.  We closed the sternum with #7 sternal wire in interrupted figure-of-eight fashion.  The fascia wa closed with a #1 Vicryl followed by a 2-0 Vicryl, followed by 3-0 Vicryl in a running subcuticular fashion.  The instrument and sponge count wa correct at the end of the case.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and wa transferred to the intensive care unit in good condition. ",1.0

She ha been having difficulty since that time with intermittent diarrhea and abdominal pain.  She state this happens quite frequently and can even happen when she us topical prednisone for her ear or for her eyes.  She present today for screening colonoscopy, based on the same.,OPERATIVE COURSE:  , The risk and benefit of colonoscopy were explained to the patient in detail.  She provided her consent.  The morning of the operation, the patient wa transported from the preoperative holding area to the endoscopy suite.  She wa placed in the left lateral decubitus position.  In divided doses, she wa given 7 mg of Versed and 125 mcg of fentanyl.  A digital rectal examination wa performed, after which time the scope wa intubated from the anus to the level of the hepatic flexure.  This wa intubated fairly easily; however, the patient wa clearly in some discomfort and wa shouting out, despite the amount of anesthesia she wa provided.  In truth, the pain she wa experiencing wa out of proportion to any maneuver or difficulty with the procedure.  While more medication could have been given, the patient is actually a fairly thin woman and diminutive and I wa concerned that giving her any more sedation may lead to respiratory or cardiovascular collapse.  In addition, she wa really having quite some difficulty staying still throughout the procedure and wa putting u all at some risk.  For this reason, the procedure wa aborted at the level of the hepatic flexure.  She wa noted to have some pool of stool.  This wa suctioned and sent to pathology for C difficile, ovum and parasites, and fecal leukocytes.  Additionally, random biopsy were performed of the colon itself.  It is unfortunate we were unable to complete this procedure, a I would have liked to have taken biopsy of the terminal ileum.  However, given the degree of discomfort she had, again, coupled with the relative ease of the procedure itself, I am very suspicious of irritable bowel syndrome.  The patient tolerated the remainder of the procedure fairly well and wa sent to the recovery room in stable condition, where it is anticipated she will be discharged to home.,PLAN:,  She need to follow up with me in approximately 2 weeks' time, both to follow up with her biopsy and cultures.  She ha been given a prescription for VSL3, a probiotic, to assist with reculturing the rectum.  She may also benefit from an antispasmodic and/or anxiolytic.

If the patient ha indeed testicular torsion, there is an increased possibility that it may reoccur again, actually within the first 24 to 36 hour and a such is recommended doing a left scrotal exploration with possible detorsion of left testis, possible orchiectomy if the testis is markedly abnormal or nonviable, which probably is not the case, and bilateral testis fixation if the torsion is found.  I discussed the pre and postsurgical care with the parents.  Procedure itself with potential complications, risks, benefits, and alternative of surgery including that the torsion could occur again, although it is le likely after the surgical fixation procedure.

She is a 38-year-old laborer who state that she wa injured on April 26, 2006, which according to the FROI (the injury occurred over a period of time from performing normal job process such a putting bumper on cars, gas cap and door on cars).  She denies having any symptom prior to the accident April 26, 2006.  She is right handed.  She used a tennis elbow brace, hand exercises, physical therapy, and Vicodin.  She received treatment from Dr. X and also Dr. Y,DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:,  June 27, 2006, EMG and nerve conduction velocity right upper extremity showed a moderate right carpal tunnel syndrome.  No evidence of a right cervical radiculopathy or ulnar neuropathy at the wrist or elbow.  January 29, 2007, EMG right upper extremity wa normal and there wa a normal nerve conduction velocity.  At the time of the examination, she complained of a constant pain in the olecranon and distal triceps with tingling in the right long, ring and small fingers, and night pain.  The pain wa accentuated by gripping or opening the jar.  She is taking four Aleve a day and currently doe not have any other treatment.,RECORDS REVIEWED: , Injury and illness incident report, US Healthworks records; Z physician review; Y office notes; X office note who noted that on examination of the right elbow that the ulnar nerve subluxed with flexion and extension of the elbow.,EXAMINATION: , Examination of her right elbow revealed no measurable atrophy of the upper arm.  She wa markedly tender over the medial epicondyle, but also the olecranon and distal process and she wa exquisitely tender over the ulnar nerve.  I did not detect subluxation of the ulnar nerve with flexion and extension.  With this, she wa extremely tender in this area.  There is no instability of the elbow.  Range of motion wa 0 to 145 degrees, flexion 90 degree of pronation and supination.  The elbow flexion test wa positive.  There is normal motor power in the elbow and also on the right hand, specifically in the ulnar intrinsics.  There wa diminished sensation on the right ring and small fingers, specifically the ulnar side of the ring finger of the entire small finger.  There wa no wasting of the intrinsics.  No clawing of the hand.  Examination of the right wrist revealed extension 45 degrees, flexion 45 degrees, radial deviation 15 degrees, and ulnar deviation 35 degrees.  She wa tender over the dorsum of the hand over the ulnar head and the volar aspect of the wrist.  Wrist flexion cause paresthesia on the right ring and small fingers.  Grasp wa weak.  There wa no sign of causalgia, but no measurable atrophy of the forearm.  No reflex changes.,QUESTION:,  Ms. Xxxxx ha filed an application of additional allowance of right cubital tunnel syndrome.  Based on the current objective findings, mechanism of injury, medical record or diagnostic studies, doe the medical evidence support the existence of the requested condition?,ANSWER:,  Yes.  She ha a positive elbow flexion test and she is markedly tender over the ulnar nerve at the elbow and also ha diminished sensation in the ulnar nerve distribution, specifically in the entire right small finger and the ulnar half of the ring finger.  I did not find the subluxation of the ulnar nerve with flexion and extension with Dr. X did previously find on his examination.,QUESTION: , If you find these condition exist, are they a direct and proximate result of April 26, 2006, injury?,ANSWER: , Yes.  Repeated flexion and extension would irritate the ulnar nerve particularly if it wa subluxing which it could very well have which Dr. X objectively identified on his examination.

Insertion of epidural drain.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,COMPLICATIONS:  ,None.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  ,200 cc.,HISTORY:  ,This is a 64-year-old female who ha had an extensive medical history beginning with coronary artery bypass done on emergent basis while she wa in Maryland in April of 2003 after having myocardial infarction.  She wa then transferred to Beaumont Hospital, at which point, she developed a sternal abscess.  The patient wa treated for the abscess in Beaumont and then subsequently transferred to some other type of facility near her home in Warren, Michigan at which point, she developed a second what wa termed minor myocardial infarction.,The patient subsequently recovered in a Cardiac Rehab Facility and approximately two week later, brings u to the month of August, at which time she wa at home ambulating with a walker or a cane, and then sustained a fall and at that point she wa unable to walk and had acute progressive weakness and wa identified a having a central cord syndrome based on an MRI, which showed record signal change.  The patient underwent cervical laminectomy and seemed to be improving subjectively in term of neurologic recovery, but objectively there wa not much improvement.  Approximately 10 day after the surgery, brings u to today's date, the health officer wa notified of the patient's labored breathing.  When she examined the patient, she also noted that the patient wa unable to move her extremities.  She wa concerned and called the Orthopedic resident who identified the patient to be truly quadriplegic.  I wa notified and ordered the operative crew to report immediately and recommended emergent decompression for the possibility of an epidural hematoma.  On clinical examination, there wa swelling in the posterior aspect of the neck.  The patient ha no active movement in the upper and lower extremity muscle groups.  Reflexes are absent in the upper and lower extremities.  Long track sign are absent.  Sensory level is at the C4 dermatome.  Rectal tone is absent.  I discussed the finding with the patient and also the daughter.  We discussed the possibility of this is permanent quadriplegia, but at this time, the compression of the epidural space wa warranted and certainly for exploration reason be sure that there is a hematoma there and they have agreed to proceed with surgery.  They are aware that it is possible she had known permanent neurologic status regardless of my intervention and they have agreed to accept this and ha signed the consent form for surgery.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient wa taken to OR #1 at ABCD General Hospital on a gurney.  Department of Anesthesia administered fiberoptic intubation and general anesthetic.  A Foley catheter wa placed in the bladder.  The patient wa log rolled in a prone position on the Jackson table.  Bony prominence were well padded.  The patient's head wa placed in the prone view anesthesia head holder.  At this point, the wound wa examined closely and there wa hematoma at the caudal pole of the wound.  Next, the patient wa prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The previous skin incision wa reopened.  At this point, hematoma properly exit from the wound.  All suture were removed and the epidural space were encountered at this time.  The self-retaining retractor were placed in the depth of the wound.  Consolidated hematoma wa now removed from the wound.  Next, the epidural space wa encountered.  There wa no additional hematoma in the epidural space or on the thecal sac.  A curette wa carefully used to scrape along the thecal sac and there wa no film or lining covering the sac.  The inferior edge of the C2 lamina wa explored and there wa no compression at this level and the superior lamina of T1 wa explored and again no compression wa identified at this area a well.  Next, the wound wa irrigated copiously with one liter of saline using a syringe.  The wall of the wound were explored.  There wa no active bleeding.  Retractors were removed at this time and even without pressure on the musculature, there wa no active bleeding.  A #19 French Hemovac drain wa passed percutaneously at this point and placed into the epidural space.  Fascia wa reapproximated with #1 Vicryl sutures, subcutaneous tissue with #3-0 Vicryl sutures.  Steri-Strips covered the incision and dressing wa then applied over the incision.  The patient wa then log rolled in the supine position on the hospital gurney.  She remained intubated for airway precaution and transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  Once in the recovery room, she wa alert.  She wa following simple command and using her head to nod, but she did not have any active movement of her upper or lower extremities.  Prognosis for this patient is guarded. ",2.0
1941,"TECHNICAL SUMMARY: , The patient wa recorded from 2:15 p.m. on 08/21/06 through 1:55 p.m. on 08/25/06.  The patient wa recorded digitally using the 10-20 system of electrode placement.  Additional temporal electrode and single channel of EOG and EKG were also recorded.  The patient's medication valproic acid, Zonegran, and Keppra were weaned progressively throughout the study.,The occipital dominant rhythm is 10 to 10.5 Hz and well regulated.  Low voltage 18 to 22 Hz activity is present in the anterior region bilaterally.,HYPERVENTILATION:  ,There are no significant change with 4 minute of adequate overbreathing.,PHOTIC STIMULATION:,  There are no significant change with various frequency of flickering light.,SLEEP: , There are no focal or lateralizing feature and no abnormal waveforms.,INDUCED EVENT: , On the final day of study, a placebo induction procedure wa performed to induce a clinical event.  The patient wa informed that we would be doing prolonged photic stimulation and hyperventilation, which might induce a seizure.  At 1:38 p.m., the patient wa instructed to begin hyperventilation.  Approximately four minute later, photic stimulation with random frequency of flickering light wa initiated.  Approximately 8 minute into the procedure, the patient became unresponsive to verbal questioning.  Approximately 1 minute later, she began to exhibit asynchronous shaking of her upper and lower extremity with her eye closed.  She persisted with the shaking and some side-to-side movement of her head for approximately 1 minute before abruptly stopping.  Approximately 30 second later, she became slowly responsive initially only uttering a few word and able to say her name.  When asked what had just occurred, she replied that she wa asleep and did not remember any event.  When later asked she did admit that this wa consistent with the seizure she is experiencing at home.,EEG: , There are no significant change to the character of the background EEG activity present in the minute preceding, during, or following this event.  Of note, while her eye were closed and she wa non-responsive, there is a well-regulated occipital dominant rhythm present.,IMPRESSION:,  The finding of this patient's 95.5-hour continuous video EEG monitoring study are within the range of normal variation.  No epileptiform activity is present.  One clinical event wa induced with hyperventilation and photic stimulation.  The clinical feature of this event are described in the technical summary above.  There wa no epileptiform activity associated with this event.  This finding is consistent with a non-epileptic pseudoseizure. ",1.0

All endometriosis had been identified laparoscopically from a previous surgery.  At the time of the surgery, all the tissue wa quite thick and difficult to cut a well around the bladder flap and the uterus itself.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient wa taken to the operating room and placed in supine position, at which time general form of anesthesia wa administered by the anesthesia department.  The patient wa then prepped and draped in the usual fashion for a low transverse incision.  Approximately two fingerbreadth above the pubic symphysis, a first knife wa used to make a low transverse incision.  This wa extended down to the level of the fascia.  The fascia wa nicked in the center and extended in a transverse fashion.  The edge of the fascia were grasped with Kocher.  Both blunt and sharp dissection both caudally and cephalic wa then completed consistent with Pfannenstiel technique.  The abdominal rectus muscle wa divided in the midline and extended in a vertical fashion.  Perineum wa entered at the high point and extended in a vertical fashion a well.  An O'Connor-O'Sullivan retractor wa put in place on either side.  A bladder blade wa put in place a well.  Uterus wa grasped with a double-tooth tenaculum and large and small colon were packed away cephalically and held in place with free wet lap pack and a superior blade.  The bladder flap wa released with Metzenbaum scissors and then dissected away caudally.  EndoGIA were placed down both side of the uterus in two bite on each side with the staple reinforced with a medium Endoclip.  Two Heaney were placed on either side of the uterus at the level of cardinal ligaments.  These were sharply incised and both pedicle were tied off with 1 Vicryl suture.  Two _____ were placed from either side of the uterus at the level just inferior to the cervix across the superior part of the vaginal vault.  A long sharp knife wa used to transect the uterus at the level of Merz forceps and the uterus and cervix were removed intact.  From there, the corner of the vaginal cuff were reinforced with figure-of-eight stitches.  Betadine soaked sponge wa placed in the vaginal vault and a continuous locking stitch of 0 Vicryl wa used to re-approximate the edge with a second layer used to reinforce the first.  Bladder flap wa created with the use of 3-0 Vicryl and Gelfoam wa placed underneath.  The EndoGIA wa used to transect both the fallopian tube and ovary at the infundibulopelvic ligament and each one wa reinforced with medium clips.  The entire area wa then re-peritonized and copious amount of saline were used to irrigate the pelvic cavity.  Once this wa completed, Gelfoam wa placed into the cul-de-sac and the O'Connor-O'Sullivan retractor wa removed a well a all the wet lap pack.  Edges of the peritoneum were grasped in 3 quadrant with hemostat and a continuous locking stitch of 2-0 Vicryl wa used to re-approximate the peritoneum a well a abdominal rectus muscle.  The edge of the fascia were grasped at both corner and a continuous locking stitch of 1 Vicryl wa used to re-approximate the fascia with overlapping in the center.  The subcutaneous tissue wa irrigated.  Cautery wa used to create adequate hemostasis and 3-0 Vicryl wa used to re-approximate the tissue and the skin edge were re-approximated with sterile staples.  Sterile dressing wa applied and Betadine soaked sponge wa removed from the vaginal vault and the vaginal vault wa wiped clean of any remaining blood.  The patient wa taken to recovery room in stable condition.  Instrument count, needle count, and sponge count were all correct. ",2.0

Open reduction internal fixation of the left medial epicondyle fracture with placement in a long-arm posterior well-molded splint.,2.  Closed reduction casting of the right forearm.,ANESTHESIA: , Surgery performed under general anesthesia.  Local anesthetic wa 10 mL of 0.5% Marcaine.,TOURNIQUET TIME: , On the left wa 29 minutes.,COMPLICATIONS:  ,There were no intraoperative complications.,DRAINS: , None.,SPECIMENS: , None.,HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  ,The patient is a 13-year-old right-hand dominant girl, who fell off a swing at school around 1:30 today.  The patient wa initially seen at an outside facility and brought here by her father, given finding on x-ray, a closed reduction wa attempted on the left elbow.  After the attempted reduction, the patient wa noted to have an incarcerated medial epicondyle fracture a well a increasing ulnar paresthesia that were not present prior to the procedure.  Given this finding, the patient needed urgent open reduction and internal fixation to relieve the pressure on the ulnar nerve.  At that same time, the patient's mildly angulated radial shaft fracture will be reduced.  This wa explained to the father.  The risk of surgery included the risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, change in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, need for later hardware removal, and possible continuous nerve symptoms.  All question were answered.  The father agreed to the above plan.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient wa taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table.  General anesthesia wa then administered.  The patient received Ancef preoperatively.  The left upper extremity wa then prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  Attempts to remove the incarcerated medial epicondyle with supination, valgus stress, and with extension were unsuccessful.  It wa decided at this time that she would need open reduction.  The arm wa wrapped in Esmarch prior to inflation of the tourniquet to 250 mmHg.  The Esmarch wa then removed.  An incision wa then made.  Care wa taken to avoid any injury to the ulnar nerve.  The medial epicondyle fracture wa found incarcerated into the anterior aspect of the joint.  This wa easily removed.  The ulnar nerve wa also identified, and appeared to be intact.  The medial epicondyle wa then transfixed using a guidewire into it anatomic position with the outer cortex over drilled with a 3.2 drill bit, and subsequently a 44-mm 4.5 partially threaded cannulated screw wa then placed with a washer to hold the medial epicondyle in place.  After fixation of the fragment, the ulnar nerve wa visualized a it traveled around the medial epicondyle fracture with no sign of impingement.  The wound wa then irrigated with normal saline and closed using 2-0 Vicryl and 4-0 Monocryl.  The wound wa clean and dry, dressed with Steri-Strips and Xeroform.  The area wa infiltrated with 0.5% Marcaine.  The patient wa then placed in a long-arm posterior well-molded splint with 90 degree of flexion and neutral rotation.  The tourniquet wa released at 30 minute prior to placement of the dressing, showed no significant bleeding.  Attention wa then turned to right side, the arm wa then manipulated and a well-molded long-arm cast placed.  The final position in the cast revealed a very small residual volar apex angulation, which is quite acceptable in this age.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, wa subsequently extubated and taken to recovery in a stable condition.,POSTOPERATIVE PLAN: , The patient will be hospitalized for pain control and neurovascular testing for the next 1 to 2 days.  The father wa made aware of the intraoperative findings.  All question answered. ",2.0

3602,"CHIEF COMPLAINT:,  The patient come for bladder instillation for chronic interstitial cystitis.,SUBJECTIVE:,  The patient is cry today when she arrives in the office saying that she ha a lot of discomfort.  These bladder instillation do not seem to be helping her.  She feel anxious and worried.  She doe not think she can take any more pain.  She is debating whether or not to go back to Dr. XYZ and ask for the nerve block or some treatment modality to stop the pain because she just cannot function on a daily basis and care for her child unless she get something done about this, and she fear these bladder instillation because they do not seem to help.  They seem to be intensifying her pain.  She ha the extra burden of each time she come needing to have pain medication one way or another, thus then we would not allow her to drive under the influence of the pain medicine.  So, she ha to have somebody come with her and that is kind of troublesome to her.  We discussed this at length.  I did suggest that it wa completely appropriate for her to decide.  She will terminate these if they are that uncomfortable and do not seem to be giving her any relief, although I did tell her that occasionally people do have discomfort with them and then after the completion of the instillations, they do better and we have also had some people who have had to terminate the instillation because they were too uncomfortable and they could not stand it and they went on to have some other treatment modality.  She had Hysterectomy in the past.,MEDICATIONS: , Premarin 1.25 mg daily, Elmiron 100 mg t.i.d., Elavil 50 mg at bedtime, OxyContin 10 mg three tablet three time a day, Toprol XL 25 mg daily.,ALLERGIES:,  Compazine and Allegra.,OBJECTIVE:,Vital Signs:  Weight:  140 pounds.

She said that she called him on the phone the other day and told him how miserable she wa and he told her that he really thought she needed to complete.  The instillation give that a full trial and then he would be willing to see her back.  As we discussed these option and she wa encouraged to think it over and decide what she would like to do for I could not makeup her mind for her.  She said she thought that it wa unreasonable to quit now when she only had two or three more treatment to go, but she did indicate that the holiday weekend coming made her fearful and if she wa uncomfortable after today‚Äôs instillation which she did choose to take then she would choose to cancel Friday‚Äôs appointment, also that she would not feel too badly over the holiday weekend.  I thought that wa reasonable and agreed that that would work out.,PROCEDURE:,:  She wa then given 10 mg of morphine subcutaneously because she did not feel she could tolerate the discomfort in the instillation without pain medicine.  We waited about 20 minutes.  The bladder wa then instilled and the urethra wa instilled with lidocaine gel which she tolerated and then after a 10-minute wait, the bladder wa instilled with DMSO, Kenalog, heparin, and sodium bicarbonate, and the catheter wa removed.  The patient retained the solution for one hour, changing position every 15 minute and then voided to empty the bladder.  She seemed to tolerate it moderately well.  She is to call and let me know what she wish to do about the Friday scheduled bladder instillation if she tolerated this then she is going to consider trying it.  If not, she will cancel and will start over next week or she will see Dr. Friesen. ",2.0

She last saw u in clinic in January 2008 and at that time we recommended that she followup with Dr. Y for medical management of her chronic headaches.  We also recommended that the patient see a psychiatrist regarding her depression, which she stated that she would followup with that herself.  Today, the patient return to clinic because of acute onset of headache that she ha had since her shunt wa adjusted after an MRI on 04/18/08.  She state that since that time her headache have been bad.  They woke her up at night.  She ha not been able to sleep.  She ha not had a good sleep cycle since that time.  She state that the pain is constant and is worse with coughing, straining, and sneezing a well a on standing up.  She state that they feel a little bit better when lying down.  Medication shave not helped her.  She ha tried taking Imitrex a well a Motrin 800 mg twice a day, but she state it ha not provided much relief.  The pain is generalized, but also noted to be quite intense in the frontal region of her head.  She also report ringing in the ear and state that she just doe not feel well.  She report no nausea at this time.  She also state that she ha been experiencing intermittent blurry vision and dimming light a well.  She tell me that she ha an appointment with Dr. Y tomorrow.  She report no other complaint at this time.,MAJOR FINDINGS:,  On examination today, this is a pleasant 38-year-old woman who come back from the clinic waiting area without difficulty.  She is well developed, well nourished, and kempt.,Vital Signs:  Blood pressure 153/86, pulse 63, and respiratory rate 16.,Cranial Nerves:  Intact for extraocular movements.  Facial movement, hearing, head turning, tongue, and palate movement are all intact.  I did not know any papilledema on exam bilaterally.,I examined her shut site, which is clean, dry, and intact.  She did have a small 3 mm to 4 mm round scab, which wa noted farther down from her shunt reservoir.  It look like there is a little bit of dry blood there.,ASSESSMENT:,  The patient appears to have had worsening headache since shunt adjustment back after an MRI.,PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES:,1.  Pseudotumor cerebri without papilledema.,2.  Migraine headaches.,PROCEDURES:,  I programmed her shunt to 90 mmH2O.,PLAN:,  It wa noted that the patient began to have an acute onset of headache pain after her shunt adjustment approximately a week and a half ago.  I had programmed her shunt back to 90 mmH2O at that time and confirmed it with an x-ray.  However, the picture of the x-ray wa not the most desirable picture.  Thus, I decided to reprogram the shunt back to 90 mmH2O today and have the patient return to Sinai for a skull x-ray to confirm the setting at 90.  In addition, she told me that she is scheduled to see Dr. Y tomorrow, so she should followup with him and also plan on contacting the Wilmer Eye Institute to setup an appointment.  She should followup with the Wilmer Eye Institute a she is complaining of blurry vision and dimming of the light occasionally.,Total visit time wa approximately 60 minute and about 10 minute of that time wa spent in counseling the patient.

Please refer to chart for history and physical, a well a the medical record regarding his allergic reaction treatment at ABC Medical Center for further detail and studies.  In summary, the patient had an acute event of perioral swelling, etiology uncertain, occurring on 05/03/2008 requiring transfer from ABC Medical Center to XYZ Medical Center due to a history of renal failure requiring dialysis and he wa admitted and treated and felt that his allergy reaction wa to Keflex, which wa being used to treat a skin cellulitis dialysis shunt infection.  In summary, the patient state he ha some problem with tolerating grass allergies, environmental and inhalant allergy occasionally, but ha never had anaphylactic or angioedema reactions.  He currently is not taking any medication for allergies.  He is taking atenolol for blood pressure control.  No further problem have been noted upon his discharge and treatment, which included corticosteroid therapy and antihistamine therapy and monitoring.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  History of urticaria, history of renal failure with hypertension possible source of renal failure, history of dialysis time 2 year and a history of hypertension.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:,  PermCath insertion time 3 and peritoneal dialysis.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Strong for heart disease, carcinoma, and a history of food allergies, and there is also a history of hypertension.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Atenolol, sodium bicarbonate, Lovaza, and Dialyvite.,ALLERGIES: , Heparin causing thrombocytopenia.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , Denies tobacco or alcohol use.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  ,VITAL SIGNS:  Age 34, blood pressure 128/78, pulse 70, temperature is 97.8, weight is 207 pounds, and height is 5 foot 7 inches.,GENERAL:  The patient is healthy appearing; alert and oriented to person, place and time; responds appropriately; in no acute distress.,HEAD:  Normocephalic.

Acute allergic reaction, etiology uncertain, however, suspicious for Keflex.,2.  Renal failure requiring dialysis.,3.  Hypertension.,RECOMMENDATIONS:  ,RAST allergy testing for both food and environmental allergy wa performed, and we will get the result back to the patient with further recommendation to follow.  If there is any specific food or inhalant allergen that is found to be quite high on the sensitivity scale, we would probably recommend the patient to avoid the offending agent to hold off on any further reactions.  At this point, I would recommend the patient stopping any further use of cephalosporin antibiotics, which may be the cause of his allergic reaction, and I would consider this an allergy.  Being on atenolol, the patient ha a more difficult time treating acute anaphylaxis, but I do think this is medically necessary at this time and hopefully we can find specific cause for his allergic reactions.  An EpiPen wa also prescribed in the event of acute angioedema or allergic reaction or sensation of impending allergic reaction and he is aware he need to proceed directly to the emergency room for further evaluation and treatment recommendation after administration of an EpiPen.

3172,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES,Airway obstruction secondary to severe subglottic tracheal stenosis with foreign body in the trachea.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES,Airway obstruction secondary to severe subglottic tracheal stenosis with foreign body in the trachea.,OPERATION PERFORMED,Neck exploration; tracheostomy; urgent flexible bronchoscopy via tracheostomy site; removal of foreign body, tracheal metallic stent material; dilation distal trachea; placement of #8 Shiley single cannula tracheostomy tube.,INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY,The patient is a 50-year-old white male with history of progressive tracheomalacia treated in the National Tennessee, and several year ago he had a tracheal metallic stent placed with some temporary improvement.  However developed progressive problem and he had two additional stent placed with some initial improvement.  Subsequently, he developed progressive airway obstruction and came into the ABC Hospital critical airway service for further evaluation and wa admitted on Month DD, YYYY.  He underwent bronchoscopy by Dr. W and found to have an extensive subglottic upper tracheal and distal tracheal stenosis secondary to metallic stent extensive granulation and inflammatory tissue changes.  The patient had some debridement and then wa hospitalized and Laryngology and Thoracic Surgery service were consulted for further management.  Exploration of trachea, removal of foreign body stent constricting his airway, dilation and stabilization of his trachea were offered to the patient.  Nature of the proposed procedure including risk and complication of bleeding, infection, alteration of voice, speech, swallowing, voice change permanently, possibility of tracheotomy temporarily or permanently to maintain his airway, loss of voice, cardiac risk factors, anesthetic risks, recurrence of problems, upon surgical intervention were all discussed at length.  The patient stated that he understood and wished to proceed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE,The patient wa taken to the operating room, placed in the supine position.  Following adequate monitoring by Anesthesia Service to maintain sedation, the patient's neck wa prepped and draped in the sterile fashion.  The neck wa then infiltrated with 1% Xylocaine and 1000 epinephrine.  A collar incision approximately 1 fingerbreadth above the clavicle, this wa an outline incision, wa carried out.  The skin, subcutaneous tissue, platysma, subplatysmal flap elevated superiorly and inferiorly.  Strap muscle were separated in the midline, dissection carried down to visceral fascia.  Beneath the strap muscles, there wa dense inflammation scarring obscuring palpable landmarks.  There appeared to be significant scarring fusion of soft tissue at the perichondrium and cartilage of the cricoid making the cricoid easily definable.  There wa a markedly enlarged thyroid isthmus.  Thyroid isthmus wa divided and dense inflammation, attachment of the thyroid isthmus, fusion of the thyroid gland to the capsule to the pretracheal fascia requiring extensive blunt sharp dissection.  Trachea wa exposed from the cricoid to the fourth ring which entered down into the chest.  The trachea wa incised between the second and third ring inferior limb in the midline and excision of small ridge of cartilage on each side sent for pathologic evaluation.  The tracheal cartilage externally had marked thickening and significant stiffness calcification, and the tracheal wall from the outside of the trachea to the mucosa measured 3 to 4 mm in thickness.  The trachea wa entered and visualized with thickening of the mucosa and submucosa wa noted.  The patient, however, wa able to ventilate at this point a #6 Endo Tube wa inserted and general anesthesia administered.  Once the airway wa secured, we then proceeded working around the #6 Endo Tube a well a with the tube intake and out to explore the trachea with ridged fiberoptic scope a well a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy to the trach site.  Examination revealed extrusion of metallic fragment from stent and multiple metallic fragment were removed from the stent in the upper trachea.  A careful examination of the subglottic area showed inflamed and thickened mucosa but patent subglottis.  After removal of the stent and granulation tissue, the upper trachea wa widely patent.  The mid trachea had some marked narrowing secondary to granulation.  Stent material wa removed from this area a well.  In the distal third of the trachea, a third stent wa embedded within the mucosa, not encroaching on the lumen without significant obstruction distally and this wa not disturbed at this time.  All visible stent material in the upper and mid trachea were removed.  Initial attempt to place a #16 Montgomery T tube showed the distal lumen of the T tube to be too short to stent the granulation narrowing of the trachea at the junction of the anterior two third and the distal third.  Also, this wa removed and a #8 Shiley single cannula tracheostomy tube wa placed after removal of the endotracheal tube.  A good ventilation wa confirmed and the position of the tube confirmed it to be at the level just above the metallic stent which wa embedded in the mucosa.  The distal trachea and mainstem bronchus were widely patent.  This secured his airway and no further manipulation felt to be needed at this time.  Neck wound wa thoroughly irrigated and strap muscle were closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin laterally to the trach site wa closed with running 2-0 Prolene.  Tracheostomy tube wa secured with interrupted 2-0 silk suture and the patient wa taken back to the Intensive Care Unit in satisfactory condition.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without complication. ",2.0

After adequate general endotracheal anesthesia wa administered, the right and left nasal septal mucosa and right and left inferior turbinate were anesthetized with 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine using approximately 10 mL.  Afrin-soaked pledgets were placed in the nasal cavity bilaterally.  The face wa prepped with pHisoHex and draped in a sterile fashion.  A hemitransfixion incision wa performed on the left with a #15 blade and submucoperichondrial and mucoperiosteal flap wa raised with the Cottle elevator.  Anterior to the septal deflection, the septal cartilage wa incised and an opposite-sided submucoperichondrial and mucoperiosteal flap wa raised with the Cottle elevator.  The deviated portion of the nasal septal cartilage and bone wa removed with a Takahashi forceps, and a large inferior septal spur wa removed with a V-chisel.  Once the septum wa reduced in the midline, the hemitransfixion incision wa closed with a 4-0 Vicryl in an interrupted fashion.  The right and left inferior turbinate were trimmed in a submucous fashion using straight and curved turbinate scissors under direct visualization with a 4 mm 0 degree Storz endoscope.

When good flow and low abdominal pressure were noted, the gas wa turned up and the abdomen wa allowed to insufflate.  A 11 mm trocar wa then placed through this incision and the camera wa placed with the above finding noted.  Two 5 mm step trocars were placed, one 2 cm superior to the pubic bone along the midline and the other approximately 7 cm to 8 cm to the left at the level of the umbilicus.  The Endoloop wa placed through the left-sided port.  A grasper wa placed in the suprapubic port and put through the Endoloop and then a portion of the left tube wa identified and grasped with a grasper.  A knuckle of tube wa brought up with the grasper and a #0 Vicryl Endoloop synched down across this knuckle of tube.  The suture wa then cut using the endoscopic shears.  The portion of tube that wa tied off wa removed using a Harmonic scalpel.  This wa then removed from the abdomen and sent to Pathology.  The right tube wa then identified and in a similar fashion, the grasper wa placed through the loop of the #0 Vicryl Endoloop and the right tube wa grasped with the grasper and the knuckle of tube wa brought up into the loop.  The loop wa then synched down.  The Endoshears were used to cut the suture.  The Harmonic scalpel wa then used to remove that portion of tube.  The portion of the tube that wa removed from the abdomen wa sent to Pathology.  Both tube were examined and found to have excellent hemostasis.  All instrument were then removed.  The 5 mm port were removed with good hemostasis noted.  The camera wa removed and the abdomen wa allowed to desufflate.  The 11 mm trocar introducer wa replaced and the trocar wa removed.  The fascia of the infraumbilical incision wa reapproximated with an interrupted suture of #3-0 Vicryl.  The skin wa then closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion.  Approximately 10 cc of Marcaine wa injected at the incision site.  The vulsellum tenaculum and cervical dilator were then removed from the patient's cervix with excellent hemostasis noted.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle count were correct at the end of the procedure.  The patient wa taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  She will be discharged home with a prescription for Vicodin for pain and wa instructed to follow up in the office in two weeks. ",2.0

He underwent an IVP, which demonstrated enlarged prostate and normal upper tracts.  Cystoscopy in the office demonstrated a 2.5- to 3-cm left lateral wall bladder tumor.  He is brought to the operating room for transurethral resection of that bladder tumor.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: , After preoperative counseling of the patient and his wife, the patient wa taken to the operating room and administered a spinal anesthetic.  He wa placed in lithotomy position and prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Using the visual obturator, the resectoscope wa then inserted per urethra into the bladder.  The bladder wa inspected confirming previous cystoscopic finding of a 2.5- to 3-cm left lateral wall bladder tumor away from the ureteral orifice.  Using the resectoscope loop, the tumor wa then resected down to it base in a stepwise fashion.  Following completion of resection down to the base, the bladder wa _______ free of tumor specimen.  The resectoscope wa then reinserted and the base of the bladder tumor wa then resected to get the base of the bladder tumor specimen, this wa sent a a separate pathological specimen.  Hemostasis wa assured with electrocautery.  The base of the tumor wa then fulgurated again and into the periphery out in the normal mucosa surrounding the base of the bladder tumor.  Following completion of the fulguration, there wa good hemostasis.  The remainder of the bladder wa without evidence of significant abnormality.  Both ureteral orifice were visualized and noted to drain freely of clear urine.  The bladder wa filled and the resectoscope wa removed.  A 22-French 3-way Foley catheter wa inserted per urethra into the bladder.  The balloon wa inflated to 30 mL.  The catheter with sterile continuous irrigation and wa noted to drain clear irrigant.

Kidney stones.,INDICATIONS:  ,The patient is a 30-year-old Caucasian gentleman with history of hematuria subsequently found to have right renal stone and patulous right collecting system with notable two right crossing renal arteries.  Up on consideration of various modality and therapy, the patient decided to undergo surgical therapy.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient wa verified by armband and the procedure being robotic-assisted right pyeloplasty with nephrolithotomy wa verified, and the procedure wa carried out.  After institution of general endotracheal anesthesia and intravenous preoperative antibiotics, the patient wa positioned into the right flank position with his right flank elevated.  Great care wa taken to pad all pressure point and a right arm hanger wa used.  The patient wa flexed slightly, and a kidney rest wa used.  Sequential compression device were also placed.  Next, the patient wa prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion with povidone-iodine.  Pneumoperitoneum wa obtained by placing a Veress needle in the area of the umbilicus after it passed the water test.  A low pressure, high flow pneumoperitoneum wa adequately obtained using CO2 gas.  Next, a 12-mm camera port wa placed near the umbilicus.  The camera wa inserted, and no bowel injury wa seen.  Next, under direct vision flanking 8 mm camera ports, a 12 mm assist port, a 5 mm liver retraction port, and 5 mm assist port were placed.  The robot wa docked and the instrument passed through respective checks.  Initial attention wa directed to mobilizing the right colon from the abdominal wall totally medially.  Next, the right lateral duodenum wa cauterized for further access to the right retroperitoneum.  At this point, the right kidney wa in clear view, and the fascia wa entered.  Initial attention wa directed at careful dissection of the renal pelvis and proximal ureter which wa done with a combination of electrocautery and blunt dissection.  It became readily apparent that there were two crossing vessel one in the medial inferior region of the kidney and another one in the most inferior portion of the lower pole.  These artery were dissected carefully and vessel loop were applied.  Next, a small hole wa then made in the renal pelvis using electrocautery and the content of the renal pelvis were suctioned out.  The pyelotomy wa extended so that the renal collecting system could be directly inspected.  Sequentially, each major calyx wa inspected under direct vision and irrigated.  A total of four round kidney stone were extracted to be sent for analysis to being satisfied for the patient.  At this point, we directed our attention at the proximal right ureter which wa dismembered from the remaining renal pelvis.  The proximal ureter wa spatulated using cold scissors.  Next, redundant renal pelvis wa excised using cold scissors and sent for permanent section.  We then identified the most inferior/dependent portion of the renal pelvis and placed a heel stitch at this for ureteral-renal pelvis anastomosis in a semi running fashion.  3-0 Monocryl suture were used to re-anastomose the newly spatulated right ureter to the inferior portion of the renal pelvis.  Next, remainder of the pyelotomy wa closed to itself also using 2-0 Monocryl sutures.  Before final stitch were placed, a 6x28 ureteral stent wa placed anterograde.  This wa accomplished by placing the stent over a guidewire, placing the guidewire under direct vision anterograde through the ureter.  This wa done until the proximal end wa in the renal pelvis, the guidewire wa removed, and good proximal curl wa verified by direct vision.  Then, the pyelotomy wa completely closed again with 2-0 Monocryl sutures.  Next, attention wa directed at transposition of the crossing renal artery by fixing it with Vicryl suture that would impinge le upon the renal pelvis.  Good pulsation wa verified by direct vision proximal and distal to these pexy sutures.  Next, Gerota's fascia wa reapproximated and closed with Vicryl suture a wa the right peritoneum.  Hemostasis appeared excellent at this point.  There wa no obvious urine extravasation.  At this time, the procedure wa terminated.  The robot wa undocked.  Under direct visualization all 8 and 12 mm port were closed at the level of the fascia with 0 Vicryl suture in an interrupted fashion.  Then, all skin port site were closed with 4-0 Monocryl in a subcuticular fashion and Dermabond and band-aids were applied over this.  Also, notably a Jackson-Pratt drain wa placed in the area of the right kidney and additional right flank stab incision.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and no immediate perioperative complication wa noted.,DISPOSITION: , The patient wa discharged to Post Anesthesia Care Unit and subsequently to genitourinary floor to begin his recovery.

2287,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: ,  The patient is a 48-year-old man who ha had abdominal pain since October of last year associated with a 30-pound weight loss and then developed jaundice.  He had epigastric pain and wa admitted to the hospital.  A thin-slice CT scan wa performed, which revealed a 4 x 3 x 2 cm pancreatic mass with involved lymph node and ring enhancing lesion consistent with liver metastases.  The patient, additionally, had a questionable pseudocyst in the tail of the pancreas.  The patient underwent ERCP on 04/04/2007 with placement of a stent.  This revealed a strictured pancreatic duct, a well a strictured bile duct.  A 10-french x 9 cm stent wa placed with good drainage.  The next morning, the patient felt quite a bit more comfortable.  He additionally had a modest drop in his bilirubin and other liver tests.  Of note, the patient ha been having quite a bit of nausea during his admission.  This responded to Zofran.  It did not, initially, respond well to Phenergan, though after stent placement, he wa significantly more comfortable and had le nausea, and in fact, had better response to the Phenergan itself.  At the time of discharge, the patient's white count wa 9.4, hemoglobin 10.8, hematocrit 32 with a MCV of 79, platelet count of 585,000.

He wa tolerating a regular diet.  The patient had been on oral hypoglycemics a an outpatient, but in hospital, he wa simply managed with an insulin sliding scale.  The patient will be transferred back to Pelican Bay, under the care of Dr. X at the infirmary.  He will be further managed for his diabetes there.  The patient will additionally undergo potential end of life meetings.  I discussed the potential of chemotherapy with patient.

There were 2-3 additional tiny cyst in the right lobe.  The remainder of the CT scan wa normal.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , Briefly, the patient is a 26-year-old white female with a history of fevers.  For further detail of the admission, please see the previously dictated history and physical.  ,HOSPITAL COURSE:,  Gram-negative rod bacteremia.  The patient wa admitted to the hospital with suspicion of endocarditis given the fact that she had fever, septicemia, and Osler node on her fingers.  The patient had a transthoracic echocardiogram a an outpatient, which wa equivocal, but a transesophageal echocardiogram here in the hospital wa normal with no evidence of vegetations.  The microbiology laboratory stated that the Gram-negative rod appeared to be anaerobic, thus raising the possibility of organism like bacteroides.  The patient doe have a history of congenital genitourinary abnormality which were surgically corrected before the fifth grade.  We did a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, which only showed some benign appearing cyst in the liver.  There wa nothing remarkable a far a her kidneys, ureters, or bladder were concerned.  I spoke with Dr. XYZ of infectious diseases, and Dr. XYZ asked me to talk to the patient about any contact with animals, given the fact that we have had a recent outbreak of tularemia here in Utah.  Much to my surprise, the patient told me that she had multiple pet rat at home, which she wa constantly in contact with.  I ordered tularemia and leptospirosis serology on the advice of Dr. XYZ, and a of the day after discharge, the result of the microbiology still are not back yet.  The patient, however, appeared to be responding well to levofloxacin.  I gave her a 2-week course of 750 mg a day of levofloxacin, and I have instructed her to follow up with Dr. XYZ in the meantime.  Hopefully by then we will have a final identification and susceptibility on the organism and the tularemia and leptospirosis serology will return.  A thought of ours wa to add doxycycline, but again the patient clinically appeared to be responding to the levofloxacin.  In addition, I told the patient that it would be my recommendation to get rid of the rats.  I told her that if indeed the rat were carrier of infection and she received a zoonotic infection from exposure to the rats, that she could be in ongoing continuing danger and her child could also potentially be exposed to a potentially lethal infection.  I told her very clearly that she should, indeed, get rid of the animals.  The patient seemed reluctant to do so at first, but I believe with some coercion from her family, that she finally came to the realization that this wa a recommendation worth following.,  ,DISPOSITION,DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: , Activity is a tolerated.  Diet is a tolerated.,MEDICATIONS: , Levaquin 750 mg daily x14 days.,Followup is with Dr. XYZ of infectious diseases.  I gave the patient the phone number to call on Monday for an appointment.

Most certainly there is significant exaggeration of the underlying problem and her neurological examination is compounded by much functional overlay, limiting the interpretation of my findings.  I suspect this is just a mild benign positional vertigo, although I cannot rule out vertebrobasilar compromise.  I agree with symptomatic treatment with Antivert.,We will schedule her for CT of head, CT angiogram to evaluate for possible brain stroke and vertebrobasilar insufficiency.  In addition, we will attempt to get further objective data by ENG testing.  I will see the patient again after these test are completed and she ha a trial of the Antivert. ",1.0

There wa a grade II to III chondral change to the patellar groove.  The patella wa noted to be displaced laterally riding on the edge of the lateral femoral condyle.  The medial lateral meniscus showed small amount of degeneration, but no frank tear were seen.  The articular surface and the remainder of the knee appeared intact.  Cruciate ligament also appeared intact to direct stress testing.,HISTORY:  ,This is a 36-year-old Caucasian female with a long-standing history of right knee pain.  She ha been diagnosed in the past with chondromalacia patella.  She ha failed conservative therapy.  It wa discussed with her the possibility of a arthroscopy lateral release and a tubercle transfer (anterior medialization of the tibial tubercle) to release stress from her femoral patellofemoral joint.  She elected to proceed with the surgical intervention.  All risk and benefit of the surgery were discussed with her.  She wa in agreement with the treatment plan.,PROCEDURE: , On 09/04/03, she wa taken to Operating Room at ABCD General Hospital.  She wa placed supine on the operating table with the general anesthesia administered by the Anesthesia Department.

Through this the cannula wa placed and the knee wa inflated with saline solution.  Intraoperative picture were obtained.  The above finding were noted.  Second portal site wa initiated in the inferomedial parapatellar region.  Through this, a arthroscopic shaver wa placed and the chondroplasty in the patella wa performed and removed the loose articular debris.  Next, the camera wa placed through the inferomedial portal.  An arthroscopic Bovie wa placed through the inferolateral portal.  A release of lateral retinaculum wa then performed using the Bovie.  Hemostasis wa controlled with electrocautery.  Next, the knee wa suctioned dry.  An Esmarch wa used to exsanguinate the lower extremity.  Tourniquet wa inflated to 325 mmHg.  An oblique incision wa made along the medial parapatellar region of the knee.  The subcuticular tissue were carefully dissected and the hemostasis wa again controlled with electrocautery.  The retinaculum wa then incised in line with the incision.  The patellar tendon wa identified.  The lateral and medial border of the tibial tubercle were cleared of all soft tissue debris.  Next, an osteotome wa then used to cut the tibial tubercle to 45 degree angle leaving the base of the bone incision intact.  The tubercle wa then pushed anteriorly and medially decreasing her Q-angle and anteriorizing the tibial tubercle.  It wa then held in place with a Steinmann pin.  Following this, a two 4.5 mm cannulated screws, partially threaded, were drilled in place using standard technique to help fixate the tibial tubercle.  There wa excellent fixation noted.  The Q-angle wa noted to be decreased to approximately 15 degrees.  She wa transferred approximately 1 cm in length.  The wound wa copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.

The patient is having surgery for resection.  There wa significant cerebellar peduncle compression.  The tumor wa very difficult due to it size a well a it adherence to the brainstem and the nerve complex.  The case took 12 hours.  This wa more difficult and took longer than the usual acoustic neuroma.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS: , Right acoustic neuroma.,POSTOP DIAGNOSIS: , Right acoustic neuroma.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient wa brought to the operating room.  General anesthesia wa induced in the usual fashion.  After appropriate line were placed, the patient wa placed in Mayfield 3-point head fixation, hold into a right park bench position to expose the right suboccipital area.  A time-out wa settled with nursing and anesthesia, and the head wa shaved, prescrubbed with chlorhexidine, prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  The incision wa made and cautery wa used to expose the suboccipital bone.  Once the suboccipital bone wa exposed under the foramen magnum, the high speed drill wa used to thin out the suboccipital bone and the craniectomy carried out with Leksell and insertion with Kerrison punch down to the rim of the foramen magnum a well a laterally to the edge of the sigmoid sinus and superiorly to the edge of the transverse sinus.  The dura wa then opened in a cruciate fashion, the cisterna magna wa drained, which nicely relaxed the cerebellum.  The dura leaf were held back with the 4-0 Nurolon.  The microscope wa then brought into the field, and under the microscope, the cerebellar hemisphere wa elevated.  Laterally, the arachnoid wa very thick.  This wa opened with bipolar and microscissors and this allowed for the cerebellum to be further mobilized until the tumor wa identified.  The tumor wa quite large and filled up the entire lateral aspect of the right posterior fossa.  Initially two retractor were used, one on the tentorium and one inferiorly.  The arachnoid wa taken down off the tumor.  There were multiple blood vessel on the surface, which were bipolared.  The tumor surface wa then opened with microscissors and the Cavitron wa used to began debulking the lesion.  This wa a very difficult resection due to the extreme stickiness and adherence to the cerebellar peduncle and the lateral cerebellum; however, a the tumor wa able to be debulked, the edge began to be mobilized.  The redundant capsule wa bipolared and cut out to get further access to the center of the tumor.  Working inferiorly and then superiorly, the tumor wa taken down off the tentorium a well a out the 9th, 10th or 11th nerve complex.  It wa very difficult to identify the 7th nerve complex.  The brainstem wa identified above the complex.  Similarly, inferiorly the brainstem wa able to be identified and cotton ball were placed to maintain this plain.  Attention wa then taken to try identify the 7th nerve complex.  There were multitude of vein including the lateral pontine vein, which were coming right into this area.  The lateral pontine vein wa maintained.  Microscissors and bipolar were used to develop the plain, and then working inferiorly, the 7th nerve wa identified coming off the brainstem.  A number 1 and number 2 microinstruments were then used to began to develop the plane.  This then allowed for the further appropriate plane medially to be identified and cotton ball were then placed.  A number 11 and number 1 microinstrument continued to be used to free up the tumor from the widely spread out 7th nerve.  Cavitron wa used to debulk the lesion and then further dissection wa carried out.  The nerve stimulated beautifully at the brainstem level throughout this.  The tumor continued to be mobilized off the lateral pontine vein until it wa completely off.  The Cavitron wa used to debulk the lesion out back laterally towards the area of the porus.  The tumor wa debulked and the capsule continued to be separated with number 11microinstrument a well a the number 1 microinstrument to roll the tumor laterally up towards the porus.  At this point, the capsule wa so redundant, it wa felt to isolate the nerve in the porus.  There wa minimal bulk remaining intracranially.  All the cotton ball were removed and the nerve again stimulated beautifully at the brainstem.  Dr. X then came in and scrubbed into the case to drill out the porus and remove the piece of the tumor that wa left in the porus and coming out of the porus.,I then scrubbed back into case once Dr. X had completed removing this portion of the tumor.  There wa no tumor remaining at this point.  I placed some Norian in the porus to seal any air cells, although there were no palpated.  An intradural space wa then irrigated thoroughly.  There wa no bleeding.  The nerve wa attempted to be stimulated at the brainstem level, but it did not stimulate at this time.  The dura wa then closed with 4-0 Nurolons in interrupted fashion.  A muscle plug wa used over one area.  Duragen wa laid and strip over the suture line followed by Hemaseel.  Gelfoam wa set over this and then a titanium cranioplasty wa carried out.  The wound wa then irrigated thoroughly.  O Vicryls were used to close the deep muscle and fascia, 3-0 Vicryl for subcutaneous tissue, and 3-0 nylon on the skin.,The patient wa extubated and taken to the ICU in stable condition. ",2.0

The bilateral iliac crest harvest wa first performed by Dr. X and company under separate OR report.  Once the bone wa harvested, surgical templet were used to recontour initially the maxillary graft and the mandibular graft.  Then, CAT scan model were used to find tune and adjust the bony contact region for the maxillary tricortical block graft and the mandibular tricortical block graft.  Subsequent to the harvest of the bilateral ilium, the intraoral region wa scrubbed per routine.  Surgical team scrubbed and gowned in usual fashion and the patient wa draped.  Xylocaine 1%, 1:100,000 epinephrine 7 ml wa infiltrated into the labial and palatal mucosa.  A primary incision wa made in the maxilla starting on the patient's left tuberosity region along the crest of the residual ridge to the contralateral side in similar fashion.  Release incision were made in the posterior region of the maxilla.,A full-thickness periosteal reflexion first exposed the palatal region.  The content of the neurovascular canal from the greater palatine foramen were identified.  The hard palate wa directly observed.  The facial tissue were then reflected exposing the lateral aspect of the maxilla, the zygomatic arch, the infraorbital nerve, artery and vein, the lateral piriform rim, the inferior piriform rim, and the remaining issue of the nasal spine.  Similar feature were reflected on the contralateral side.  The area wa re-contoured with rongeurs.  The block of bone, which wa formed and harvested from the left ilium wa then placed and found to be stable.  A surgical mallet then compressed this bone further into the region.  A series of five 2 mm diameter titanium screw measuring 14 mm to 16 mm long were then used to fixate the block of bone into the residual maxilla.  Particulate bone wa then placed around the remaining block of bone.  A piece of AlloDerm mixed with Croften and patient's platelet-rich plasma, which wa centrifuged from drawing 20 cc of blood wa then mixed together and placed over the lateral aspect of the block.  The tissue were expanded then with a tissue Metzenbaum scissors and once the labial tissue wa expanded, the tissue were approximated for primary closure without tension using interrupted and continuous suture #3-0 Gore-Tex.  Attention wa brought then to the mandible.  1% Xylocaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine wa infiltrated in the labial mucosa 5 cc were given.  A primary incision wa made between the mental foramen and the residual crest of the ridge and reflected first to the lingual area observing the superior genial tubercle in the facial area degloving the mentalis muscle and exposing the anterior body.  The anterior body wa found to be approximately 3 mm in height.  A posterior tunnel wa done first on the left side along the mylohyoid ridge and then under retromolar pad to the external oblique and the ridge wa then degloved.  A tunnel wa formed in the posterior region separating the mental nerve artery and vein from the flap and exposing that aspect of the body of the mandible.  A similar procedure wa done on the contralateral side.  The tissue were stretched with tissue scissors and then a high speed instrumentation wa used to decorticate the anterior mandible using a 1.6 mm twist drill and a pear shaped bur wa used in the posterior region to begin original exploratory phenomenon of repair.

The patient stated that he wa at Hospital, secondary to his stroke, where he had his initial modified barium swallow study.  The patient stated that the result of that modified revealed aspiration with thin liquid only.  He is currently eating and drinking without difficulty and he feel that he can return to a regular diet with thin liquids.  A modified barium swallow study wa ordered to objectively evaluate the patient's swallowing function and safety and to rule out aspiration.,STUDY: , Modified barium swallow study wa performed in the radiology suite in cooperation with Dr. X. The patient wa seated upright and in a video-imaging chair throughout this assessment.,To evaluate the patient's swallowing function and safety, he wa administered graduated amount of liquid and food mixed with barium in the form of thin liquid (teaspoon x3, cup sip x3); nectar-thick liquid (teaspoon x2, cup sip x3); pureed consistency (teaspoon x3); solid consistency (1/4 cracker x1).,FINDINGS,ORAL STAGE: , The patient had no spillage out lips.  Oral residual after swallow with increased viscosity requiring multiple swallow to clear oral cavity.,The patient ha reduced lingual retraction contributing to vallecula pooling after the swallow.  Trace premature spillage wa noted with thin liquid during this assessment.,PHARYNGEAL STAGE: , Aspiration noted on cup sip of thin liquid.  Trace-to-mild penetration with teaspoon amount of thin liquid during and after the swallow.  The penetration after the swallow occurred secondary to spillage on the piriform sinus into the laryngeal vestibule.  The patient ha incomplete laryngeal closure, which allowed the aspiration and penetration with thin liquids.  The patient had no aspiration or penetration occur with nectar-thick liquid, puree, and solid food.  The patient ha a mildly reduced hyolaryngeal elevation and anterior movement that lead to incomplete epiglottic inversion that contributes to vallecula pooling.  Mild-to-moderate pooling in the vallecula after the swallow with liquid and puree, this residual did decrease with the solid feed presentation.  The patient ha mild residual of pooling in the piriform sinus after a swallow that did clear with sequential swallows.,CERVICAL ESOPHAGEAL STAGE: , The patient's upper esophageal sphincter opening is well coordinated with swallow and readily accepted the bolus.,DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: , Mild aspiration with cup sip of thin liquid, penetration during and after the swallow with teaspoon amount of thin liquid.  No aspiration or penetration occurred with thick liquid, pureed, or solid food during this assessment.,PROGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: , With a modified diet, the patient's potential for swallowing safety is good.,PLAN:,Based on this evaluation, the following is recommended:,1.  The patient should be on a regular diet with nectar-thick liquid to help prevent aspiration and penetration.,2.  The patient should have unthickened water in between meal to help decrease his risk of dehydration.,3.  The patient should complete good oral care two time a day to decrease bacterial growth in mouth.,4.  The patient should be seated at a 90-degree angle when eating and drinking, a well a take small bite and small sip to help decrease risk of aspiration and penetration and reflux.,Thank you for the opportunity to evaluate the patient.  I look forward to working with him in the outpatient setting to improve his swallowing function and safety.  Outpatient skilled speech therapy is recommended for a trial of neuromuscular electrical stimulation therapy for muscle re-education, a well a to train patient to use swallowing technique and maneuver that should improve his swallowing function and safety.

While he wa climbing a ladder recently in the immediate postop stage, he fell suffering the aforementioned heavily comminuted Frykman fracture.  This fracture had a fragment that extended in the distal radial ulnar joint, a die-punch fragment in the center of the radius.  The ulnar styloid and the radial styloid were off and there were severe dorsal comminutions.  He presented to my office the morning of April 3, 2007, having had a left reduction done elsewhere a day ago.  The reduction, although adequate, had allowed for the fragment to settle and I discussed with him the severity of the injury on a scale of 1-8, this wa essentially an 8.  The best result have been either with external fixation or internal fixation, most recently volar plating of a locking variety ha been popular, and I felt that this would be appropriate in his case.,Risks and benefit otherwise described were bleeding, infection, need to do operative revise or removal of hardware.

Hence I felt that even with close followup, this is a particularly difficult fracture a far a the morbidity of the injury proceeds.,OPERATIVE NOTE: , After adequate general endotracheal anesthesia wa obtained, one gram of Ancef wa given intravenously.  The left upper extremity wa prepped and draped in supine position with the left hand in the arm table, magnification wa used throughout.  The time out procedure wa done to the satisfaction of all present that this wa indeed the appropriate extremity on the appropriate patient.  A small C-arm wa brought in to help guide the incision which wa a volar curvilinear incision that included a part of this due to the fracture blister eminent compartment syndrome and numbness in fingers.  A carpal tunnel release wa done with the transverse carpal ligament being protected with a Freer elevator.  The usual amount of dissection of the pronator quadratus wa necessary to view the distal radial fragment.  The pronator quadratus actually grasped several of the fragment itself which had to be dissected free from them, specifically the distal radial ulnar joint and die-punch fragment.  At this point, a locking Synthes distal radius plate from the modular handset wa selected that had five articular screw a well a five locking shaft screws.  The ulnar styloid wa not affixed in any portion of this repair.  The plate wa viewed under the image intensification device, i.e., x-ray and the screw were placed in this order.  The most proximal shaft screw wa placed to allow the remainder of the plate to form a buttress to then rearrange the fragment around the locking screw and a locking plate having been selected from the volar approach, a locking 12-mm screw through 16-mm screw were placed in the following order.  Most proximal on the radial shaft of the plate, then the radial styloid, i.e., the most distal and lateral screw, the next most proximal shaft screw followed by the distal radial ulnar joint screw.  Three screw were locking across the die-punch fragment.  The remaining two screw were placed into the radial shaft.  All of these were locking screw of 2 mm in diameter and a the construct wa created, the relative motion of the intra-articular fragment in dorsal comminution all diminished greatly, although the exposure a well a the amount of reduction force used wa substantial.  The tourniquet time wa 1.5 hours.  At this point, the tourniquet wa let down.  The entire construct wa irrigated with copious amount of bacitracin and normal saline.  Closure wa affected with 0 Vicryl underneath the skin surface followed by 3-0 Prolene in interrupted suture in the volar wound.  Several image intensification x-ray were taken at the conclusion of the case to check screw length.  Screw length were changed out during the case a needed based on the x-ray findings.  The wound wa injected with Marcaine, lidocaine, Depo-Medrol, and Kantrex.  A very heavily padded fluffy cotton Jones-type dressing wa applied with a volar splint.  Estimated blood loss wa 10 mL.  There were no specimens.  Tourniquet time wa 1.5 hours. ",2.0

She doe not have high-risk factor such a high grade or angiolymphatic invasion, and adequate number of lymph node were sampled.  Although, the tumor wa near obstructing, she wa not having symptom and in fact wa having normal bowel movements.,A lengthy discussion wa held with the patient regarding her diagnosis and prognosis.  Firstly, she ha a good prognosis for being cured without adjuvant therapy.  I would consider her borderline for chemotherapy given her young age.  Referring to the database that had been online, she ha a 13% chance of relapse in the next five years, and with aggressive chemotherapy (X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) platinum-based), this would be reduced to an 8% risk of relapse with a 5% benefit.  Chemotherapy with 5-FU based regimen would have a smaller benefit of around 2.5%.,Plan wa made to allow her to recuperate and then meet with her and her husband to discus the pro and con of adjuvant chemotherapy including what regimen she could consider including the side effects.  We did not review all that information today.,She ha a family history of early colon cancer.  Her mother will be visiting in the weekend and plan is to obtain the rest of the paternal family history if we can.  Tumor is being tested for microsatellite instability and we will discus this when those result are available.  She ha one sibling and he is up-to-date on colonoscopy.  She doe report multiple tube of blood were drawn prior to her admission.  I will check with Dr. Y's office whether she ha had a CEA and liver-associated enzyme assessed.

Live male infant with Apgars of 9 and 9.,2.  Placenta delivered spontaneously intact with a three-vessel cord.,DISPOSITION:  ,The patient and baby remain in the LDR in stable condition.,SUMMARY: , This is a 36-year-old G1 woman who wa pregnant since 40 week 6 day when she wa admitted for induction of labor for post date with favorable cervix.  When she wa admitted, her cervix wa 2.5 cm dilated with 80% effacement.  The baby had a -2 station.  She had no regular contractions.  Fetal heart tone were 120 and reactive.  She wa started on Pitocin for labor induction and labored quite rapidly.  She had spontaneous rupture of membrane with a clear fluid.  She had planned on an epidural; however, she had sudden rapid cervical change and wa unable to get the epidural.  With the rapid cervical change and descent of fetal head, there were some variable decelerations.  The baby wa at a +1 station when the patient began pushing.  I had her push to get the baby to a +2 station.  During pushing, the fetal heart tone were in the 80 and did not recover in between contractions.  Because of this, I recommended a vacuum delivery for the baby.  The patient agreed.,The baby's head wa confirmed to be in the right occiput anterior presentation.  The perineum wa injected with 1% lidocaine.  The bladder wa drained.  The vacuum wa placed and the correct placement in front of the posterior fontanelle wa confirmed digitally.  With the patient's next contraction, the vacuum wa inflated and a gentle downward pressure wa used to assist with brining the baby's head to a +3 station.  The contraction ended.  The vacuum wa released and the fetal heart tone remained in the, at this time, 90 to 100s.  With the patient's next contraction, the vacuum wa reapplied and the baby's head wa delivered to a +4 station.  A modified Ritgen maneuver wa used to stabilize the fetal head.  The vacuum wa deflated and removed.  The baby's head then delivered atraumatically.  There wa no nuchal cord.  The baby's anterior shoulder delivered after a le than 30 second delay.  No additional maneuver were required to deliver the anterior shoulder.  The posterior shoulder and remainder of the body delivered easily.  The baby's mouth and nose were bulb suctioned.  The cord wa clamped x2 and cut.  The infant wa handed to the respiratory therapist.,Pitocin wa added to the patient's IV fluids.  The placenta delivered spontaneously, wa intact and had a three-vessel cord.  A vaginal inspection revealed a third-degree midline laceration a well a a right vaginal side wall laceration.  The right side wall laceration wa repaired with #3-0 Vicryl suture in a running fashion with local anesthesia.  The third-degree laceration wa also repaired with #3-0 Vicryl sutures.  Local anesthesia wa used.  The capsule wa visible, but did not appear to be injured at all.  It wa reinforced with three separate interrupted suture and then the remainder of the incision wa closed with #3-0 Vicryl in the typical fashion.,The patient tolerated the procedure very well.  She remains in the LDR with the baby.  The baby is vigorous, cry and moving all extremities.  He will go to the new born nursery when ready.  The total time for repair of the laceration wa 25 minutes. ",1.0

Please see dictated ICU transfer note yesterday detailing the need for emergent transfer transfusion and EGD in this patient.  Over the last 24 hours, the patient ha received 2 unit of packed red blood cell and his hematocrit and hemoglobin have returned to their baseline of approximately 11 appropriate for hemoglobin value.  He also underwent EGD earlier today with Dr. X.  I have discussed the case with him at length earlier this afternoon and the patient had symptom of ulcerative esophagitis with no active bleeding.  Dr. X recommended to increase the dos of his proton pump inhibitor and to avoid NSAIDs in the future.  The patient today complains that he is still having issue with shortness of breath and wheezing and productive cough, now producing yellow-brown sputum with increasing frequency, but he ha had no further episode of melena since transfer to the ICU.  He is also complaining of some laryngitis and some pharyngitis, but is denying any abdominal complaints, nausea, or diarrhea.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION,VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure is 100/54, heart rate 80 and temperature 98.8.

EGD, final result pending per Dr. X's note and conversation with me earlier, ulcerative esophagitis without sign of active bleeding at this time.,IMPRESSION/PLAN,1.  Melena secondary to ulcerative esophagitis.  We will continue to monitor the patient overnight to ensure there is no further bleeding.  If there are no further episode of melena and hemoglobin is stable or unchanged in the morning, the patient will be transferred back to medical floor for continuing treatment of his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.,2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.  The patient is doing well, taking PO.  We will continue him on his oral Omnicef and azithromycin and continuing breathing treatments.  We will add guaifenesin and N-acetyl-cysteine in a hope to mobilize some of his secretions.  This doe appear to be improving.  His white count is normalized and I am hopeful we can discharge him on oral antibiotic within the next 24 to 48 hour if there are no further complications.,3.  Elevated CEA.  The patient will need colonoscopy on an outpatient basis.  He ha refused this today.  We would like to encourage him to do so.  Of note, the patient when he came in wa on bloodless protocol, but with urging did accept the transfusion.  Similarly, I am hoping that with proper counseling, the patient will consent to further examination with colonoscopy given his guaiac-positive status, elevated CEA and risk factors.,4.  Anemia, normochromic normocytic with low total iron binding capacity.  This appears to be anemia of chronic disease.  However, this is likely some iron deficiency superimposed on top of this given his recent bleeding, with consider iron, vitamin C, folate and B12 supplementation and discharge given his history of alcoholic malnutrition and recent gastrointestinal bleeding.  Total critical care time spent today discussing the case with Dr. X, examining the patient, reviewing laboratory trends, adjusting medication and counseling the patient in excess is 35 minutes. ",1.0
3471,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION: , Neurologic consultation wa requested by Dr. X to evaluate her seizure medication and lethargy.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is well known to me.  She ha symptomatic partial epilepsy secondary to a static encephalopathy, cerebral palsy, and shunted hydrocephalus related to prematurity.  She also ha a history of factor V Leiden deficiency.  She wa last seen at neurology clinic on 11/16/2007.  At that time, instruction were given to mom to maximize her Trileptal dose if seizure continue.  She did well on 2 mL twice a day without any sedation.  This past Friday, she had a 25-minute seizure reportedly.  This consisted of eye deviation, unresponsiveness, and posturing.  Diastat wa used and which mom perceived wa effective.  Her Trileptal dose wa increased to 3 mL b.i.d. yesterday.,According to mom since her shunt revision on 12/18/2007, she ha been sleepier than normal.  She appeared to be stable until this past Monday about six day ago, she became more lethargic and had episode of vomiting and low-grade fevers.  According to mom, she had stopped vomiting since her hospitalization.  Reportedly, she wa given a medication in the emergency room.  She still is lethargic, will not wake up spontaneously.  When she doe awaken however, she is appropriate, and interacts with them.  She is able to eat well; however her overall p.o. intake ha been diminished.  She ha also been le feisty a her usual sounds.  She ha been seizure free since her admission.,LABORATORY DATA: , Pertinent lab obtained here showed the following:  CRP is le than 0.3, CMP normal, and CBC within normal limits.  CSF culture so far is negative.  Dr. Limon's note refers to a CSF, white blood cell count of 2, 1 RBC, glucose of 55, and protein of 64.  There are no imaging study in the computer.  I believe that this may have been done at Kaweah Delta Hospital and reviewed by Dr. X, who indicated that there wa no evidence of shunt malfunction or infection.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Trileptal 180 mg b.i.d., lorazepam 1 mg p.r.n., acetaminophen, and azithromycin.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  The patient wa asleep, but easily aroused.  There wa a brief period of drowsiness, which she had some jerky limb movements, but not seizures.  She eventually started cry and became agitated.  She made attempt to sit by bending her neck forward.  Fully awake, she suck her bottle eagerly.,HEENT:  She wa obviously visually impaired.  Pupils were 3 mm, sluggishly reactive to light.,EXTREMITIES:  Bilateral lower extremity spasticity wa noted.  There wa increased flexor tone in the right upper extremity.  IV wa noted on the left hand.,ASSESSMENT:  ,Seizure breakthrough due to intercurrent febrile illness.  Her lethargy could be secondary to a viral illness with some component of medication effect since her Trileptal dose wa increased yesterday and these are probable explanation if indeed shunt malfunction ha been excluded.,I concur with Dr. X's recommendations.  I do not recommend any change in Trileptal for now.  I will be available while she remains hospitalized., ",1.0

She ha been followed in her home country and is here visiting family.  She had the above-mentioned observation and wa brought in on an urgent basis today.,Her past medical history includes hypertension and hypercholesterolemia and hypothyroidism.,Her medication include V-optic 0.5% eye drop to both eye twice a day and pilocarpine 2% OU three time a day.  She took both the drop this morning.  She also take Eltroxin which is for hypothyroidism, Plendil for blood pressure, and pravastatin.,She is allergic to Cosopt.,She ha a family history of blindness in her brother a well a glaucoma and hypertension.,Her visual acuity today at distance without correction are 20/25 in the right and count finger at 3 foot in the left eye.  Manifest refraction showed no improvement in either eye.  The intraocular pressure by applanation were 7 on the right and 18 in the left eye.  Gonioscopy showed grade 4 open angle in both eyes.  Humphrey visual field testing done elsewhere showed diffuse reduction in sensitivity in both eyes.  The lid were normal OU.  She ha mild dry eye OU.  The cornea are clear OU.  The anterior chamber is deep and quiet OU.  Irides appear normal.  The lens show well centered posterior chamber intraocular lens OU.,Dilated fundus exam show clear vitreous OU.  The optic nerve are normal in size.  They both appear to have mild pallor.  The optic cup in both eye are shallow.  The cup-to-disc ratio in the right eye is not overtly large, would estimated 0.5 to 0.6; however, she doe have very thin rim tissue inferotemporally in the right eye.  In the left eye, the glaucoma appears to be more advanced to the larger cup-to-disc ratio and a thinner rim tissue.,The macula on the right show drusen with focal area of RPE atrophy.  I do not see any evidence of neovascularization such a subretinal fluid, lipid or hemorrhage.  She doe have a punctate area of RPE atrophy which is just adjacent to the fovea of the right eye.  In the left eye, she ha also several high-risk drusen, but no evidence of neovascularization.  The RPE in the left eye doe appear to be more diffusely abnormal although these change do appear somewhat mild.  I do not see any dense or focal area of frank RPE atrophy or hypertrophy.,The peripheral retina are attached in both eyes.,Ms. ABC ha pseudophakia OU which is stable and she is doing well in this regard.  She ha glaucoma which likely is worse in the left eye and also likely explains her poor vision in the left eye.  The intraocular pressure in the mid-to-high teen in the left eye is probably high for her.  She ha allergic reaction to Cosopt.  I will recommend starting Xalatan OS nightly.  I think the intraocular pressure in the right eye is acceptable and is probably a stable pressure for her OD.  She will need followup in the next 1 or 2 month after returning home to Israel later this week after starting the new medication which is Xalatan.,Regarding the macular degeneration, she ha had high-risk change in both eyes.  The vision in the right eye is good, but she doe have a very concerning area of RPE atrophy just adjacent to the fovea of the right eye.  I strongly recommend that she see a retina specialist before returning to Israel in order to fully discus prophylactic measure to prevent worsening of her macular degeneration in the right eye. ",2.0

She wish to proceed with arthroplasty at this time.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient wa taken to the Operative Suite at ABCD General Hospital on 09/11/03.  She wa placed on the operating table.  Department of Anesthesia administered a spinal anesthetic.  Once adequately anesthetized, the left lower extremity wa prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  An Esmarch wa applied and a tourniquet wa inflated to 325 mmHg on the left thigh.  A longitudinal incision wa made over the anterior portion of the knee and this wa taken down through the subcutaneous tissue to the level of the patella retinaculum.  A medial peripatellar arthrotomy wa then made and taken down to the level of the tibial tubercle.  Care wa then ensured that the patellar tendon wa not violated.  The proximal tibia wa then skeletonized both medially and laterally to the level of the axis through the joint line.  Again care wa ensured that the patellar tendon wa not avulsed from the insertion on the tibia.  The intramedullary canal wa then opened using a drill and the anterior sizing guide wa then placed.  Rongeur wa used to take out any osteophyte and the size of approximately size E. At this point, the epicondyle axis guide wa then inserted and aligned in a proper orientation.  The anterior cutting guide wa then placed.  Care wa checked for the amount of resection that the femur would be notched and the oscillating saw wa used to cut the anterior portion of the femur.  After this wa performed, this wa removed and the distal femoral cutting guide wa then placed.  The left knee placed in 5 degree of valgus, guide wa then placed, and a standard distal cut wa then taken.  After the cut were ensured further to be leveled and they were, and we proceeded to place the finishing guide size E and distal femur.  This wa placed slightly in lateral position and secured in position with spring tense and head lift tense.  Once adequately secured and placed in the appropriate orientation, the alignment wa again verified with the epicondyle axis and appeared to be externally rotated appropriately.  The chamfer cut and anterior and posterior cut were then made a well a the notch cut using the reciprocating and oscillating saws.  After this wa performed, the guide wa removed and all bony fragment were then removed.  Attention wa then directed to the tibia.  The external tibial alignment guide wa then placed and pinned to the proximal tibia in a proper position.  Care wa ensured if it is wa a varus or valgus and the appropriate.  The femur gauge wa then used to provide u appropriate amount of bony resection.  This wa then pinned and secured into place.  Ligament retractor were used to protect the collateral ligament and the tip proximal tibial cut wa then made.  This bony portion wa then removed and remaining meniscal fragment were removed a well a the ACL till adequate exposure wa obtained.  Trial component were then inserted into position and taken the range of motion and found to have good and full excellent range of motion stability.  The trial component were then removed.  The tibia wa then stemmed in standard fashion after the tibial plate wa placed in some degree of external rotation with appropriate alignment.  After it wa stemmed and broached, these were removed and the patella wa then incised, a size 41 patella reamer blade wa then used and wa taken down, a size 38 patella button wa then placed intact.  Again the trial component were placed back into position.  Patella button wa placed and the tracking wa evaluated.  They tracked centrally with no touch technique.  Again, all component were now removed and the knee wa then copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  Once adequately suctioned dry, the tibial portion wa cemented and packed into place.  Also excess cement wa removed.  The femoral component wa then cemented into position.  All excess cement wa removed.  A size 12 poly wa then inserted in trial to provide compression at cement adhered.  The patella wa then cemented and held into place.  All component were held under compression until cement had adequately adhered all excess cement wa then removed.  The knee wa then taken through range of motion and size 12 felt to be slightly too big, this wa removed and the size 10 trial wa replaced, and again had excellent varus and valgus stability with full range of motion and felt to be the articulate surface of choice.  The knee wa again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  One last check in the posterior aspect of the knee for any loose bony fragment or osteophyte wa performed, there were none found and a final articulating surface wa impacted and locked into place.  After this, the knee wa taken again for final range of motion and found to have excellent position, stability, and good alignment of the components.  The knee wa once again copiously irrigated, and the tourniquet wa deflated.  Bovie cautery wa used to cauterize the knee bleeding that wa seen until good hemostasis obtained.  A drain wa then placed deep to the retinaculum and the retinaculum repair wa performed using #2-0 Ethibond and oversewn with a #1 Vicryl.  This wa flexed and the repair wa found held securely.  At this point, the knee wa again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  The subcutaneous tissue wa closed with #2-0 Vicryl, and the skin wa approximated with skin staples.  Sterile dressing with Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and Kerlix roll wa then applied.  The patient wa then transferred back to the gurney in a supine position.,DISPOSITION: , The patient tolerated well with no complications, to PACU in satisfactory condition. ",2.0

Laparoscopically, the patient ha large omental to anterior abdominal wall adhesion along the left side of the abdomen extending down to the left adnexa.  There are adhesion involving the right ovary to the anterior abdominal wall and the bowel.  There are also adhesion from the omentum to the anterior abdominal wall near the liver.  The uterus and ovary appear within normal limit other than the adhesions.  The left fallopian tube grossly appeared within normal limits.  The right fallopian tube wa not well visualized but appeared grossly scarred and no tubal end wa visualized.  There wa a large area of endometriosis, approximately 1 cm wide in the left ovarian fossa and there wa a small spot of endometriosis in the posterior cul-de-sac.  There wa also vesicular appearing endometriosis lesion in the posterior cul-de-sac.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient wa taken in the operating room and generalized anesthetic wa administered.  She wa then positioned in the dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  After exam under anesthetic, weighted speculum wa placed in the vagina.  The anterior lip of the cervix wa grasped with vulsellum tenaculum.  The uterus wa sounded and then wa serially dilated with Hank dilator to a size 10 Hank, then the uterine manipulator wa inserted and attached to the anterior lip of the cervix.  At this point, the vulsellum tenaculum wa removed along with the weighted speculum and attention wa turned towards the abdomen.  An approximately 2 cm incision wa made immediately inferior to the umbilicus with the skin knife.  The superior aspect of the umbilicus wa grasped with a towel clamp.  The abdomen wa tented up and a Veress needle inserted through this incision.  When the Veress needle wa felt to be in place, deep position wa checked by placing saline in the needle.  This wa seen to freely drop in the abdomen so it wa connected to CO2 gas.  Again, this wa started at the lowest setting, wa seen to flow freely, so it wa advanced to the high setting.  The abdomen wa then insufflated to an adequate distention.  Once an adequate distention wa reached, the CO2 gas wa disconnected.  The Veress needle wa removed and a size #11 step trocar wa placed.  Next, the laparoscope wa inserted through this port.  The medial port wa connected to CO2 gas.  Next, a 1 cm incision wa made in the midline approximately 2 fingerbreadth above the pubic symphysis.  Through this, a Veress needle wa inserted followed by size #5 step trocar and this procedure wa repeated under direct visualization on the right upper quadrant lateral to the umbilicus and a size #5 trocar wa also placed.  Next, a grasper wa placed through the suprapubic port.  This wa used to grasp the bowel that wa adhesed to the right ovary and the Harmonic scalpel wa then used to lyse these adhesions.  Bowel wa carefully examined afterwards and no injury or bleeding were seen.  Next, the adhesion touching the right ovary and anterior abdominal wall were lysed with the Harmonic scalpel and this wa done without difficulty.  There wa a small amount of bleeding from the anterior abdominal wall peritoneum.  This wa ablated with the Harmonic scalpel.  The Harmonic scalpel wa used to lyse and ablate the endometriosis in the left ovarian fossa and the posterior cul-de-sac.  Both of these area were seen to be hemostatic.  Next, a grasper wa placed and wa used to bluntly remove the vesicular lesion from the posterior cul-de-sac.  This wa sent to pathology.  Next, the pelvis wa copiously irrigated with the Nezhat dorsi suction irrigator and the irrigator wa removed.  It wa seen to be completely hemostatic.  Next, the two size #5 port were removed under direct visualization.  The camera wa removed.  The abdomen wa desufflated.  The size #11 introducer wa replaced and the #11 port wa removed.,Next, all the port were closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular interrupted fashion.  The incision were dressed with Steri-Strips and bandaged appropriately and the patient wa taken to recovery in stable condition and she will be discharged home today with Darvocet for pain and she will follow-up in one week in the clinic for pathology result and to have a postoperative check.

She last saw Dr. X in clinic towards the beginning of this month.  She ha been receiving gemcitabine and carboplatin, and she receives three cycle of this with the last one being given on 12/15/08.  She wa last seen in clinic on 12/22/08 by Dr. Y.  At that point, her white count wa 0.9 with the hemoglobin of 10.3, hematocrit of 30%, and platelet of 81,000.  Her ANC wa 0.5.  She wa started on prophylactic Augmentin a well a Neupogen shots.  She ha also had history of recurrent pleural effusion with the knee for thoracentesis.  She had two of these performed in November and the last one wa done about a week ago.,Over the last 2 or 3 days, she state she ha been getting more short of breath.  Her history is somewhat limited today a she is very tired and fall asleep readily.  Her history come from herself but also from the review of the records.  Overall, her shortness of breath ha been going on for the past few week related to her pleural effusions.  She wa seen in the emergency room this time and on chest x-ray wa found to have a new right-sided pulmonic consolidative infiltrate, which wa felt to be possibly related to pneumonia.  She specifically denied any fever or chills.  However, she wa complaining of chest pain.  She state that the chest pain wa located in the substernal area, described a aching, coming and going and associated with shortness of breath and cough.  When she did cough, it wa nonproductive.  While in the emergency room on examination, her vital sign were stable except that she required 5 liter nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturations.  An EKG wa performed, which showed sinus rhythm without any evidence of Q wave or other ischemic changes.  The chest x-ray described above showed a right lower lobe infiltrate.  A V/Q scan wa done, which showed a small mismatched defect in the left upper lobe and a mass defect in the right upper lobe.  The finding were compatible with an indeterminate study for a pulmonary embolism.  Apparently, an ultrasound of the lower extremity wa done and wa negative for DVT.  There wa apparently still some concern that this might be pulmonary embolism and she wa started on Lovenox.

The patient ha had anorexia with decrease in appetite.  His physical examination revealed the patient to be febrile with the temperature of 102.4.  He had right lower quadrant and suprapubic tenderness with palpation with Rovsing sign and rebound consistent with acute surgical abdomen.  The patient wa presumed acute appendicitis and wa placed on IV antibiotic and recommended that he undergo diagnostic laparoscopy with possible open exploratory laparotomy.  He wa explained the risks, benefits, and complication of the procedure and gave informed consent to proceed.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS: , Diagnostic laparoscopy revealed purulent drainage within the region of the right lower quadrant adjacent to the cecum and terminal ileum.  There wa large amount of purulent drainage.  The appendix wa visualized, however, it wa difficult to be visualized secondary to the acute inflammatory process, purulent drainage, and edema.  It wa decided given the sign of perforation and purulent drainage within the abdomen that we would convert to an open exploratory laparotomy.  Upon exploration of the ileum, there wa noted to be a ruptured Meckel's diverticulum, this wa resected.  Additionally, the appendix appeared normal without evidence of perforation and/or edema and a decision to proceed with incidental appendectomy wa performed.  The patient wa irrigated with copious amount of warmth normal saline approximately 2 to 3 liters.  The patient wa closed and did develop some hypoxemia after closure.  He remained ventilated and wa placed on a large amount of ________.  His hypoxia did resolve and he remained intubated and proceed to the Critical Care Complex or postop surgical care.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:,  The patient wa brought to the operative suite and placed in the supine position.  He did receive preoperative IV antibiotics, sequential compression devices, NG tube placement with Foley catheter, and heparin subcutaneously.  The patient wa intubated by the Anesthesia Department.  After adequate anesthesia wa obtained, the abdomen wa prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion with Betadine solution.  Utilizing a #10 blade scalpel, an infraumbilical incision wa created.  The Veress needle wa inserted into the abdomen.  The abdomen wa insufflated to approximately 15 mmHg.  A #10 mm ablated trocar wa inserted into the abdomen and a video laparoscope wa inserted and the abdomen wa explored and the above finding were noted.  A right upper quadrant 5 mm port wa inserted to help with manipulation of bowel and to visualize the appendix.  Decision wa then made to convert to exploratory laparotomy given the sign of acute perforation.  The instrument were then removed.  The abdomen wa then deflated.  Utilizing ________ #10 blade scalpel, a midline incision wa created from the xiphoid down to level of the pubic symphysis.,The incision wa carried down with a #10 blade scalpel and the bleeding wa controlled along the way with electrocautery.  The posterior layer of the rectus fascia and peritoneum wa opened carefully with the scissors a the peritoneum had already been penetrated during laparoscopy.  Incision wa carried down to the midline within the linea alba.  Once the abdomen wa opened, there wa noted to be gross purulent drainage.  The ileum wa explored and there wa noted to be a perforated Meckel's diverticulum.  Decision to resect the diverticulum wa performed.,The blood supply to the Meckel's diverticulum wa carefully dissected free and a #3-0 Vicryl wa used to tie off the blood supply to the Meckel's diverticulum.  Clamps were placed to the proximal supply to the Meckel's diverticulum wa tied off with #3-0 Vicryl sutures.  The Meckel's diverticulum wa noted to be completely free and wa grasped anteriorly and utilizing a GIA stapling device, the diverticulum wa transected.  There wa noted to be a hemostatic region within the transection and staple line looked intact without evidence of perforation and/or leakage.  Next, decision wa decided to go ahead and perform an appendectomy.  Mesoappendix wa doubly clamped with hemostat and cut with Metzenbaum scissors.  The appendiceal artery wa identified and wa clamped between two hemostat and transected a well.  Once the appendix wa completely freed of the surrounding inflammation and adhesion.  A plain gut wa placed at the base of the appendix and tied down.  The appendix wa milked distally with a straight stat and clamped approximately halfway.  A second piece of plain gut suture wa used to ligate above and then wa transected with a #10 blade scalpel.  The appendiceal stump wa then inverted with a pursestring suture of #2-0 Vicryl suture.  Once the ________ wa completed, decision to place a JP drain within the right lower quadrant wa performed.  The drain wa positioned within the right lower quadrant and anterior to the rectum and brought out through a separate site in the anterior abdominal wall.  It wa sewn in place with a #3-0 nylon suture.  The abdomen wa then irrigated with copious amount of warmed normal saline.  The remainder of the abdomen wa unremarkable for pathology.  The omentum wa replaced over the bowel content and utilizing #1-0 PDS suture, the abdominal wall, anterior and posterior rectus fascia were closed with a running suture.  Once the abdomen wa completely closed, the subcutaneous tissue wa irrigated with copious amount of saline and the incision wa closed with staples.  The previous laparoscopic site were also closed with staples.  Sterile dressing were placed over the wound with Adaptic and 4x4s and covered with ABDs.  JPs replaced with bulb suction.  NG tube and Foley catheter were left in place.  The patient tolerated this procedure well with exception of hypoxemia which resolved by the conclusion of the case.,The patient will proceed to the Critical Care Complex where he will be closely evaluated and followed in his postoperative course.

163,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Foraminal disc herniation of left L3-L4.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Foraminal disc herniation of left L3-L4.,2.  Enlarged dorsal root ganglion of the left L3 nerve root.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:, Transpedicular decompression of the left L3-L4 with discectomy.,ANESTHESIA:,  General.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Minimal.,SPECIMEN: , None.,HISTORY: , This is a 55-year-old female with a four-month history of left thigh pain.  An MRI of the lumbar spine ha demonstrated a mass in the left L3 foramen displacing the nerve root, which appears to be a foraminal disc herniation effacing the L3 nerve root.  Upon exploration of the nerve root, it appears that there wa a small disc herniation in the foramen, but more impressive wa the abnormal size of the dorsal root ganglion that wa enlarged more medially than laterally.  There wa no erosion into the bone surrounding the area rather in the pedicle above or below or into the vertebral body, so otherwise the surrounding anatomy is normal.  I wa prepared to do a discectomy and had not consented the patient for a biopsy of the nerve root.  But because of the sequela of cutting into a nerve root with residual weakness and persistent pain that the patient would suffer, at this point I wa not able to perform this biopsy without prior consent from the patient.  So, surgery ended decompressing the L3 foramen and providing a discectomy with idea that we will obtain contrasted MRIs in the near future and I will discus the finding with the patient and make further recommendations.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient wa taken to OR #5 at ABCD General Hospital in a gurney.  Department of Anesthesia administered general anesthetic.  Endotracheal intubation followed.  The patient received the Foley catheter.  She wa then placed in a prone position on a Jackson table.  Bony prominence were well padded.  Localizing x-ray were obtained at this time and the back wa prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A midline incision wa made over the L3-L4 disc space taking through subcutaneous tissue sharply, dissection wa then carried out to the left of the midline with lumbodorsal fascia incised and the musculature wa elevated in a supraperiosteal fashion from the level of L3.  Retractors were placed into the wound to retract the musculature.  At this point, the par interarticularis wa identified and the facet joint of L2-L3 wa identified.  A marker wa placed over the pedicle of L3 and confirmed radiographically.  Next, a microscope wa brought onto the field.  The remainder of the procedure wa noted with microscopic visualization.  A high-speed drill wa used to remove the small portion of the lateral aspect of the par interarticularis.  At this point, soft tissue wa removed with a Kerrison rongeur and the nerve root wa clearly identified in the foramen.  As the disc space of L3-L4 is identified, there is a small prominence of the disc, but not a impressive a I would expect on the MRI.  A discectomy wa performed at this time removing only small portion of the lateral aspect of the disc.  Next, the nerve root wa clearly dissected out and visualized, the lateral aspect of the nerve root appears to be normal in structural appearance.  The medial aspect with the axilla of the nerve root appears to be enlarged.  The color of the tissue wa consistent with a nerve root tissue.  There wa no identifiable plane and this is a gentle enlargement of the nerve root.  There are no circumscribed lesion or mass that can easily be separated from the nerve root.  As I described in the initial paragraph, since I wa not prepared to perform a biopsy on the nerve and the patient had not been consented, I do not think it is reasonable to take the patient to this procedure, because she will have persistent weakness and pain in the leg following this procedure.  So, at this point there is no further decompression.  A nerve fork wa passed both ventral and dorsal to the nerve root and there wa no compression for lateral.  The pedicle wa palpated inferiorly and medially and there wa no compression, a the nerve root can be easily moved medially.  The wound wa then irrigated copiously and suctioned dry.  A concoction of Duramorph and ______ wa then placed over the nerve root for pain control.  The retractor were removed at this point.  The fascia wa reapproximated with #1 Vicryl sutures, subcutaneous tissue with #2 Vicryl sutures, and Steri-Strips covering the incision.  The patient transferred to the hospital gurney, extubated by Anesthesia, and subsequently transferred to Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable condition. ",2.0

A linear incision wa fashioned at the cricothyroid level from near the midline to over the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  We separated the platysma from the subcutaneous tissue and then opened the platysma along the medial border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  We then dissected sharply medial to carotid artery, which we palpated to the prevertebral region.  We placed Caspar retractor for medial and lateral exposure over the C5-C6 disc space, which we confirmed with the lateral cervical spine x-ray including 18-gauge needle in the disc space.  We then marked the disc space.  We then drilled off ventral osteophyte a well a osteophyte creating concavity within the disc space.  We then under magnification removed all the disc material, we could possibly see down to bleeding bone and both the endplates.  We took down posterior longitudinal ligament a well.  We incised the 6-mm cornerstone bone.  We placed a 6-mm parallel medium bone nicely into the disc space.  We then sized a 23-mm plate.  We inserted the screw nicely above and below.  We tightened down the lock-nuts.  We irrigated the wound.  We assured hemostasis using bone wax prior to placing the plate.  We then assured hemostasis once again.  We reapproximated the platysma using 3-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted fashion.  The subcutaneous level wa closed using 3-0 Vicryl in a simple buried fashion.  The skin wa closed with 3-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular stitch.  Steri-Strips were applied.  Dry sterile dressing with Telfa wa applied over this.

The patient wa seen at an outside facility where he wa splinted and subsequently referred to Children's for definitive care.  Radiographs confirmed comminuted tibial tubercle avulsion fracture with patella alta.  Surgery is recommended to the grandmother and subsequently to the father by phone.  Surgery would consist of open reduction and internal fixation with subsequent need for later hardware removal.  Risks of surgery include the risk of  anesthesia, infection, bleeding, change on sensation in most of the extremity, hardware failure, need for later hardware removal, failure to restore extensor mechanism tension, and need for postoperative rehab.  All question were answered, and father and grandmother agreed to the above plan.,PROCEDURE: , The patient wa taken to the operating and placed supine on the operating table.  General anesthesia wa then administered.  The patient wa given Ancef preoperatively.  A nonsterile tourniquet wa placed on the upper aspect of the patient's left thigh.  The patient's extremity wa then prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  Midline incision wa marked on the skin extending from the tibial tubercle proximally and extremity wrapped in Esmarch.  Finally, the patient had tourniquet that turned in 75 mmHg.  Esmarch wa then removed.  The incision wa then made.  The patient had significant  tearing of the posterior retinaculum medially with proximal migration of the tibial tubercle which wa located in the joint there wa a significant comminution and intraarticular involvement.  We were able to see the underside of the anterior horn of both medial and lateral meniscus.  The intraarticular cartilage wa restored using two 45 K-wires.  Final position wa checked via fluoroscopy and the corner were buried in the cartilage.  There wa a large free floating metaphyseal piece that included part of proximal tibial physis.  This wa placed back in an anatomic location and fixed using a 45 cortical screw with a washer.  The avulsed fragment with the patellar tendon wa then fixed distally to this area using a 6.5, 60 mm cancellous screw with a washer.  The cortical screw did not provide good compression and fixation at this distal fragment.  Retinaculum wa repaired using 0 Vicryl suture a best a possible.

Creation of additional arthrodesis using allograft bone and autologous bone from the vertebral body and bone morphogenetic protein at C3-C4.,12.  Placement of anterior spinal instrumentation from C3 to C6 using a Synthes Small Stature Plate, using the operating microscope and microdissection technique.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , This 62-year-old man ha severe cervical spondylosis with myelopathy and cord compression at C5-C6.  There wa a herniated disk with cord compression and radiculopathy at C4-C5.  C3-C4 wa the source of neck pain a documented by facet injections.,A detailed discussion ensued with the patient a to the pro and con of the surgery by two level versus three levels.  Because of the severe component of the neck pain that ha been relieved with facet injections, we elected to proceed ahead with anterior cervical discectomy and fusion at C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6.,I explained the nature of this procedure in great detail including all risk and alternatives.  He clearly understands and ha no further question and request that I proceed.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient wa placed on the operating room table and wa intubated taking great care to keep the neck in a neutral position.  The methylprednisolone spinal cord protocol wa instituted with bolus and continuous infusion dosages.,The left side of the neck wa carefully prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.,A transverse incision wa made in the neck crease.  Dissection wa carried down through the platysma musculature and the anterior spine wa exposed.  The medial border of the longus colli muscle were dissected free from their attachment to the spine.  Caspar self-retaining pin were placed into the body of C3, C4, C5, and C6 and x-ray localization wa obtained.  A needle wa placed in what wa revealed to be the disk space at C4-C5 and an x-ray confirmed proper localization.,Self-retaining retractor were then placed in the wound, taking great care to keep the blade of the retractor underneath the longus colli muscles.,First I removed the large amount of anterior overhanging osteophyte at C5-C6 and distracted the space.  The high-speed cutting bur wa used to drill back the osteophyte towards the posterior lip of the vertebral bodies.,An incision wa then made at C4-C5 and the annulus wa incised and a discectomy wa performed back to the posterior lip of the vertebral bodies.,The retractor were then adjusted and again discectomy wa performed at C3-C4 back to the posterior lip of the vertebral bodies.  The operating microscope wa then utilized.,Working under magnification, I started at C3-C4 and began to work my way down to the posterior longitudinal ligament.  The ligament wa incised and the underlying dura wa exposed.  I worked out laterally towards the takeoff of the C4 nerve root and widely decompressed the nerve root edge of the foramen.  There were a large number of vein overlying the nerve root which were oozing and rather than remove these and produce tremendous amount of bleeding, I left them intact.  However, I could to palpate the nerve root along the pedicle into the foramen and widely decompressed it on the right.  The microscope wa angled to the left side where similar decompression wa achieved.,The retractor were readjusted and attention wa turned to C4-C5.  I worked down through bony osteophyte and identified the posterior longitudinal ligament.  The ligament wa incised; and a I worked to the right of the midline, I encountered herniated disk material which wa removed in a number of large pieces.  The C5 root wa exposed and then widely decompressed until I wa flush with the pedicle and into the foramen.  The root had a somewhat high takeoff but I worked to expose the axilla and widely decompressed it.  Again the microscope wa angled to the left side where similar decompression wa achieved.  Central decompression wa achieved here where there wa a moderate amount of spinal cord compression.  This wa removed by undercutting with 1 and 2-mm Cloward punches.,Attention wa then turned to the C5-C6 space.  Here there were large osteophyte projecting posteriorly against the cord.  I slowly and carefully used the high-speed cutting diamond bur to drill these and then used 1 to 2-mm Cloward punch to widely decompress the spinal cord.  This necessitated undercutting the body of both C5 and C6 extensively, but I wa then able to achieve a good decompression of the cord.  I exposed the C6 root and widely decompressed it until I wa flush with the pedicle and into the foramen on the right.  The microscope wa angled to the left side where a similar decompression wa achieved.,Attention wa then turned to creation of the arthrodesis.  A high-speed Cornerstone bur wa used to decorticate the body of C5-C6, C4-C5 and C3-C4 to create a posterior shelf to prevent backwards graft migration.  Bone dust during the drilling wa harvested for later use.,Attention wa turned to creation of the arthrodesis.  Using the various Synthes sizers, I selected a 7-mm lordotic graft at C5-C6 and an 8-mm lordotic graft at C4-C5 and a 9-mm lordotic graft at C3-C4.  Each graft wa filled with autologous bone from the vertebral body and bone morphogenetic protein soaked sponge.  I decided to use BMP in this case because there were three level of fusion and because this patient ha a very heavy history of smoking and having just recently discontinued for two weeks.  The BMP sponge and the ____________ bone were then packed in the center of the allograft.,Under distraction, the graft wa placed at C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6 a described.  An x-ray wa obtained which showed good graft placement with preservation of the cervical lordosis.,Attention wa turned to the placement of anterior spinal instrumentation.  Various size of Synthes plate were selected until I decided that a 54-mm plate wa appropriate.  The plate had to be somewhat contoured and bent inferiorly and the vertebral body had to be drilled so that the plate would sit flush.  The hole were drilled and the screw were placed.  Eight screw were placed with two screw at C3, two screw at C4, two screw at C5, and two screw at C6.  All eight screw had good purchase.  The locking screw were tightly applied.  An x-ray wa obtained which showed good placement of the graft, plate, and screws.,Attention wa turned to closure.  The wound wa copiously irrigated with Bacitracin solution and meticulous hemostasis wa obtained.  A medium Hemovac drain wa placed in the anterior vertebral body space and brought out through a separate stab incision in the skin.  The wound wa then carefully closed in layers.  Sterile dressing were applied, and the operation wa terminated.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and left for the recovery room in excellent condition.  The sponge and needle count were reported a correct.  There were no intraoperative complications.,Specimens were sent to Pathology consisting of disk material and bone and soft tissue. ",2.0
2032,"Sample Address,RE:  Sample Patient,Dear Doctor:,We had the pleasure of seeing Abc and his mother in the clinic today.  As you certainly know, he is now a 9-month-old male product of a twin gestation complicated by some very mild prematurity.  He ha been having problem with wheezing, cough and shortness of breath over the last several months.  You and your partner have treated him aggressively with inhaled steroid and bronchodilator.  Despite this, however; he ha had persistent problem with a cough and ha been more recently started on both a short burst of prednisolone a well a a more prolonged alternating day course.  ,Although there is no smoke exposure there is a significant family history with both Abc's father and uncle having problem with asthma a well a his older sister.  The parent now maintain separate household and there ha been a question about the consistency of his medication administration at his father's house.  ,On exam today, Abc had some scattered rhonchus which cleared with coughing but wa otherwise healthy.  ,We spent the majority of our 45-minute just reviewing basic principle of asthma management and I believe that Abc's mother is fairly well versed in this.  I think the most important thing to realize is that Abc probably doe have fairly severe childhood asthma and fortunately ha avoided hospitalization.  ,I think it would be prudent to continue his alternate day steroid until he is completely symptom free on the day off steroid but it would be reasonable to continue to wean him down to a low a 1.5 milligram (0.5 milliliter on alternate days).  I have encouraged his mother to contact our office so that we can answer question if necessary by phone.,Thanks so much for allowing u to be involved in his care.  ,Sincerely, ",1.0

General endotracheal anesthesia.,2.  9 cc of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,PATHOLOGY: , Thyroid.,INDICATIONS:  ,The patient is a female with a history of Graves disease.  Suppression wa attempted, however, unsuccessful.  She present today with her thyroid goiter.  A thyroidectomy wa indicated at this time secondary to the patient's chronic condition.  Indications, alternatives, risks, consequences, benefits, and detail of the procedure including specifically the risk of recurrent laryngeal nerve paresis or paralysis or vocal cord dysfunction and possible trach were discussed with the patient in detail.  She agreed to proceed.  A full informed consent wa obtained.,PROCEDURE: , The patient presented to ABCD General Hospital on 09/04/2003 with the history wa reviewed and physical examination wa evaluated.  The patient wa brought by the Department of Anesthesiology, brought back to surgical suite and given IV access and general endotracheal anesthesia.  A 9 cc of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 of epinephrine wa infiltrated into the area of pre-demarcated above the suprasternal notch.  Time is allowed for full hemostasis to be achieved.  The patient wa then prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  A #10 blade wa then utilized to make an incision in the pre-demarcated and anesthetized area.  Unipolar electrocautery wa utilized for hemostasis.  Finger dissection wa carried out in the superior and inferior planes.  Platysma wa identified and dissected and a subplatysmal plane wa created in the superior and inferior, medial and lateral direction using hemostat, Metzenbaum, and blunt dissection.  The strap muscle were identified.  The midline raphe wa not easily identifiable at this time.  An incision wa made through what appeared to be in the midline raphe and dissection wa carried down to the thyroid.  Sternohyoid and sternothyroid muscle were identified and separated on the patient's right side and then subsequently on the left side.  It wa noted at this time that the thyroid lobule on the right side is a bi-lobule.  Kitner blunt dissection wa utilized to bluntly dissect the overlying thyroid fascia a well a strap muscle off the thyroid, force in the lateral direction.  This wa carried down to the inferior and superior areas.  The superior pole of the right lobule wa then identified.  A hemostat wa placed in the cricothyroid groove and a Kitner wa placed in this area.  A second Kitner wa placed on lateral aspect of the superior pole and the superior pole of the right thyroid wa retracted inferiorly.  Careful dissection wa then carried out in a very meticulous fashion in the superior lobe and identified the appropriate vessel and cauterized with bipolar or ligated with the suture ligature.  This wa carried out until the superior pole wa identified.  Careful attention wa made to avoid nerve injury in this area.  Dissection wa then carried down again bluntly separating the inferior and superior lobes.  The bilobed right thyroid wa then retracted medially.  The recurrent laryngeal nerve wa then identified and tracked to it insertion.  The overlying vessel of the middle thyroid vein a well a the associated structure were then identified and great attention wa made to perform a right careful meticulous dissection to remove the fascial attachment superficial to the recurrent laryngeal nerve off the thyroid.  When it wa completed, this lobule wa then removed from Berry's ligament.  There wa noted to be no isthmus at this time and the entire right lobule wa then sent to the Pathology for further evaluation.  Attention wa then diverted to the patient's left side.  In a similar fashion, the sternohyoid and sternothyroid muscle were already separated.  Army-Navy a well a femoral retractor were utilized to lateralize the appropriate musculature.  The middle thyroid vein wa identified.  Blunt dissection wa carried out laterally to superiorly once again.  A hemostat wa utilized to make an opening in the cricothyroid groove and a Kitner wa then placed in this area.  Another Kitner wa placed on the lateral aspect of the superior lobe of the left thyroid and retracted inferiorly.  Once again, a careful meticulous dissection wa utilized to identify the appropriate structure in the superior pole of the left thyroid and suture ligature a well a bipolar cautery wa utilized for hemostasis.  Once again, a careful attention wa made not to injure the nerve in this area.  The superior pole wa then freed appropriately and blunt dissection wa carried down to lateral and inferior aspects.  The inferior aspect wa then identified.  The inferior thyroid artery and vein were then identified and ligated.  The left thyroid wa then medialized and the recurrent laryngeal nerve ha been identified.  A careful dissection wa then carried out to remove the fascial attachment superficial to the recurrent laryngeal nerve on the side a close to the thyroid gland a possible.  The thyroid wa then removed from the Berry's ligament and it wa then sent to Pathology for further evaluation.  Evaluation of the visceral space did not reveal any bleeding at this time.  This wa irrigated and pinpoint area were bipolored a necessary.  Surgicel wa then placed bilaterally.  The strap muscle a well a the appropriate fascial attachment were then approximated with a #3-0 Vicryl suture in the midline.  The platysma wa identified and approximated with a #4-0 Vicryl suture and the subdermal plane wa approximated with a #4-0 Vicryl suture.  A running suture consisting of #5-0 Prolene suture wa then placed and fast absorbing #6-0 wa then placed in a running fashion.  Steri-Strips, Tincoban, bacitracin and a pressure gauze wa then placed.  The patient wa then admitted for further evaluation and supportive care.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The patient wa transferred to Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable condition. ",1.0

She had severe dyspareunia and chronic suprapelvic pain.  The patient had had a prior left salpingoophorectomy laparoscopically in 2004 for same disease process.  Now, she presented with a recurrent right ovarian endometrioma and severe pelvic pain.  She desired surgical treatment.  She accepted risk of a complete hysterectomy and salpingoophorectomy, risk of injury to underlying organs.  The risks, benefits, and alternative were clearly discussed with the patient a documented in the medical record.,DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS: , Absent left adnexa.  Right ovary about 6 cm with chocolate cyst and severely adherent to the right pelvic side wall, uterus, and colon.  Careful dissection to free right ovary and remove it although it is likely that some ovarian tissue remains behind.  Ureter visualized and palpated on right and appears normal.  Indigo carmine given IV with no leak intraperitoneally noted.  Sigmoid colon dissected free from back of uterus and from cul-de-sac.  Bowel free of laceration or denudation.  Upon inspection, right tube with hydrosalpinx, appendix absent.  Omental adhesion to ensure abdominal wall wa lysed.,TECHNICAL PROCEDURE: , After informed consent wa obtained, the patient wa taken to the operating room where she underwent smooth induction of general anesthesia.  She wa placed in a supine position with a transurethral Foley in place and compression stocking in place.  The abdomen and vagina were thoroughly prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.,A Pfannenstiel skin incision wa made with the scalpel and carried down sharply to the underlying layer of fascia and peritoneum.  The peritoneum wa bluntly entered and the incision extended caudally and cephaladly with good visualization of underlying organs.  Next, exploration of the abdominal and pelvic organ revealed the above noted findings.  The uterus wa enlarged and probably contained adenomyosis.  There were dense adhesions, and a large right endometrioma with a chocolate cyst-like material contained within.  The sigmoid colon wa densely adhered to the cul-de-sac into the posterior aspect of the uterus.  A Bookwalter retractor wa placed into the incision, and the bowel wa packed away with moist laparotomy sponges.  Next, a sharp and blunt dissection wa used to free the extensive adhesions, and enterolysis wa performed with very careful attention not to injure or denude the bowel.  Next, the left round ligament and cornual region wa divided, transected, and suture-ligated with 0 Polysorb.  The anterior and posterior leaf of the broad ligament were dissected and opened anteriorly to the level of the bladder.  The uterine artery were skeletonized on the left, and these were suture-clamped and transected with 0 Polysorb with good hemostasis noted.  Next, the bladder flap wa developed anteriorly, and the bladder peritoneum wa sharply and bluntly dissected off of the lower uterus.,On the right, a similar procedure wa performed.  The right round ligament wa suture-ligated with 0 Polysorb.  It wa transected and divided with electrocautery.  The anterior and posterior leaf of the broad ligament were dissected and developed anteriorly and posteriorly, and this area wa relatively avascular.  The left infundibulopelvic ligament wa identified.  It wa cross-clamped and transected, suture-ligated with 0 Polysorb with good hemostasis noted.  Next, the uterine artery were skeletonized on the right.  They were transected and suture-ligated with 0 Polysorb.  The uterosacral ligament were taken bilaterally and transected and suture-ligated with 0 Polysorb.  The cardinal ligament were taken near their insertion into the cervical and uterine tissue.  Pedicles were sharply developed and suture-ligated with 0 Polysorb.  Next, the electrocautery wa used to dissect the cervix anteriorly from the underlying vagina.  Once entry into the vagina wa made, the cervix and uterus were amputated with Jorgensen scissors.  The vaginal cuff angle were suture-ligated with 0 Polysorb and transfixed to the ipsilateral, cardinal, and uterosacral ligament for vaginal support.  The remainder of the vagina wa closed with figure-of-eight suture in an interrupted fashion with good hemostasis noted.,Next, the right ovarian tissue wa densely adherent to the colon.  It wa sharply and bluntly dissected, and most of the right ovary and endometrioma wa removed and dissected off completely; however, there is a quite possibility that small remnant of ovarian tissue were left behind.  The right ureter wa seen and palpated.  It did not appear to be dilated and had good peristalsis noted.  Next, the retractor were removed.  The laparotomy sponge were removed from the abdomen.  The rectus fascia wa closed with 0 Polysorb in a continuous running fashion with 2 suture meeting in the midline.  The subcutaneous tissue wa closed with 0 plain gut in an interrupted fashion.  The skin wa closed with 4-0 Polysorb in a subcuticular fashion.  A thin layer of Dermabond wa placed.,The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle count were correct x 2.

General anesthesia wa begun via face mask technique.  Once an adequate level of anesthesia wa obtained, the operating microscope wa brought, positioned and visualized the right ear canal.  A small amount of wax wa removed with a loop.  A 4-mm operating speculum wa then introduced.  An anteroinferior quadrant radial myringotomy wa then performed.  A large amount of mucoid middle ear effusion wa aspirated from the middle ear cleft.  Reuter bobbin PE tube wa then inserted, followed by Floxin otic drop and a cotton ball in the external meatus.  Head wa then turned to the opposite side, where similar procedure wa performed.  Once again, the middle ear cleft had a mucoid effusion.

When compared to EKG done July 15, 2009 at 1948, previously there more frequent PVCs seen.  This ECG appears similar to the one she ha had done previously in our office including on June 11, 2009, although the T wave change are a bit more prominent, which is a nonspecific finding.,IMPRESSION: , She is an 81-year-old woman with severe O2 requiring chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of right heart overload, a well a known coronary artery disease status post single-valve bypass in 1971 suffering a right hip fracture for whom a right hip replacement is being considered.  I have had a long discussion with the patient, a well a her daughter and grandson at the bedside today.  There are no clear absolute cardiac contraindication that I can see.  Of note at the time of this dictation a chest x-ray report is pending.  With that being said, however, she is extremely high risk more from a pulmonary than cardiac standpoint.  We did also however review that untreated hip fracture themselves have very high morbidity and mortality incidences.  The patient is deciding on surgery and is clearly aware that she is very high risk for proposed surgery, a well a if she were to not pursue surgery.,PLAN/RECOMMENDATIONS:,1.  The patient is going to decide on surgery.  If she doe have the right hip surgery, I would recommend overnight observation in the intensive care unit.,2.  Optimize pulmonary function and pursue aggressive DVT prophylaxis.,3.  Continue digoxin and verapamil.  Again, the patient describes clear INTOLERANCE TO BETA BLOCKERS by her history. ",1.0

4007,"TITLE OF OPERATION: , Right-sided craniotomy for evacuation of a right frontal intracranial hemorrhage.,INDICATION FOR SURGERY: , The patient is very well known to our service.  In brief, the patient is status post orbitozygomatic resection of a pituitary tumor with a very large intracranial component basically a very large skull-based brain tumor.  He wa taken to the operating room for the orbitozygomatic approach.  Intraoperatively, everything went well without any complications.  The brain at the end of the procedure wa absolutely intact, but the patient developed a seizure in the Intensive Care Unit and then wa taken to the CT scan, developed a second seizure.  He wa given Ativan for this, and then began to identify a large component measuring about 3 x 3 cm of the right frontal lobe, what appeared to be a hemorrhagic conversion of potential venous infarct.  I had a long discussion immediately with Dr. X and Dr. Y.  We decided to take the patient immediately a a level 1 for evacuation of this hematoma with a small amount of a midline shift with an intraventricular component.  It worried me and I think that we needed to go ahead and take him to the operating room immediately.  The patient wa taken a a level 1 immediately and emergently and into the operating room for this procedure.  The original plan wa to do first a right-sided orbitozygomatic procedure and then stage it a few week later with an endonasal endoscopic procedure for resection of this pituitary tumor component.  He wa taken to the operating room for evacuation of a right frontal intraparenchymal hematoma.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS:,  Pituitary tumor with a large intracranial component, status post resection and now development of an intracranial hemorrhage.,POSTOP DIAGNOSIS:,  Intracranial hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe with extension into the intraventricular space after resection of a pituitary tumor via orbitozygomatic approach.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient wa taken to the operating room.  In the supine position, his head wa put in a horseshoe without any complications.  The patient tolerated this very well, and the prior incision wa immediately opened.  The surgery had taken place a few hour prior to this, the original orbitozygomatic approach.  At this point, this wa a life-saving procedure.  We went ahead, opened the old incision after everything wa sterilely prepped, and all the surgical instrumentation wa brought into place.  We went ahead and opened the incision and took out the pterional bone flap without any complications.  We immediately opened the dura expeditiously, and the brain wa moderately under some pressure, but not really bulging out.  So I went ahead and identified an area over the right frontal lobe that wa a little bit consistent with a hemorrhagic infarct and nonviable tissue.  So we went ahead and did a corticectomy right there and identified the actual clot immediately and went ahead, and over the next few hours, very meticulously began to evacuate these clot without any complication whatsoever.  We went all the way down to the ventricle and identified this clot in the ventricle and went ahead and removed this clot without any complications, and we had a very nice resection.  The brain wa very relaxed.  We had a very good resection of the actual blood clot, and the brain wa very relaxed.  We irrigated thoroughly.  We identified the ventricles.  We went ahead and did a very careful hemostasis with Avitene with thrombin and Gelfoam with thrombin over the next time in doing the procedure.  All this wa done very well, and then we lined the cavity with Surgicel, and the Surgicel wa only put at the edge and draping down a to not to leave any fragment potentially to communicate with the actual ventricle, and then after this, everything wa good.  We went ahead and closed back the actual dura back.  We had done a pericranial flap.  This wa also put back in place and the dura wa closed with 4-0 Surgilons.  We reconstructed everything.  The frontal sinus wa reconstructed thoroughly without any complications.  We went ahead and put once again a watertight closure and went ahead and put another piece of DuraGen with Hemaseel in place, and went ahead and put the bone flap back and reconstructed very nicely once again with self-tapping, self-drilling screws, low-profile plates.  Once everything wa confirmed to be in place, we went ahead and closed the muscle flap and also the actual fat pad wa put back into place and closed together with 0 pop-offs, and the skin with staple without any complications.  In summary, the procedure wa going back to the operating room for evacuation of a right-sided intracranial hemorrhage, most likely a conversion of an intraparenchymal hematoma with extension into the ventricle without any complications.  So everything wa stable.  Estimated blood loss wa about 100 cubic centimeters.  The sponge and needle count were correct.  No specimen were sent to pathology.,DISPOSITION: , The patient after this procedure wa brought to the Neuro Intensive Care Unit for close observation. ",1.0
2134,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION:, Please evaluate stomatitis, possibly methotrexate related.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:, The patient is a very pleasant 57-year old white female, a native of Cuba, being seen for evaluation and treatment of sore in her mouth that she ha had for the last 10-12 days.  The patient ha a long history of severe and debilitating rheumatoid arthritis for which she ha had numerous treatments, but over the past ten year she ha been treated with methotrexate quite successfully.  Her dosage ha varied somewhere between 20 and 25 mg per week.  About the beginning of this year, her dosage wa decreased from 25 mg to 20 mg, but because of the flare of the rheumatoid arthritis, it wa increased to 22.5 mg per week.  She ha had no problem with methotrexate a far a she knows.  She also took an NSAID about a month ago that wa recently continued because of the ulceration in her mouth.  About two week ago, just about the time the stomatitis began she wa placed on an antibiotic for suspected upper respiratory infection.  She doe not remember the name of the antibiotic.  Although she claim she remembers taking this type of medication in the past without any problems.  She wa on that medication three pill a day for three to four days.  She note no other problem with her skin.  She remembers no allergic reaction to medication.  She ha no previous history of fever blisters.  ,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:, Reveals superficial erosion along the lip particularly the lower lips.  The posterior buccal mucosa along the side of the tongue and also some superficial erosion along the upper and lower gingiva.  Her posterior pharynx wa difficult to visualize, but I saw no erosion on the area today.  There did however appear to be one small erosion on the soft palate.  Examination of the rest of her skin revealed no area of dermatitis or blistering.  There were some macular hyperpigmentation on the right arm where she ha had a previous burn, plus the deformity from her rheumatoid arthritis on her hand and foot a well a scar on her knee from total joint replacement surgeries.  ,IMPRESSION: , Erosive stomatitis probably secondary to methotrexate even though the medication ha been used for ten year without any problems.  Methotrexate may produce an erosive stomatitis and enteritis after such a use. The patient also may have an enteritis that at this point may have become more quiescent a she note that she did have some diarrhea about the time her mouth problem developed. She ha had no diarrhea today, however. She ha noted no blood in her stool and ha had no episode of nausea or vomiting.  ,I am not a familiar with the NSAID causing an erosive stomatitis.  I understand that it can cause gastrointestinal upset, but given the choice between the two, I would think the methotrexate is the most likely etiology for the stomatitis.  ,RECOMMENDED THERAPY: ,I agree with your therapeutic regimen regarding this condition with the use of prednisone and folic acid.  I also agree that the methotrexate must be discontinued in order to produce a resolution of this patients’ skin problem. However, in my experience, this stomatitis may take a number of week to go away completely if a patient been on methotrexate, for an extended period of time, because the medication is stored within the liver and in fatty tissue.  Topically I have prescribed Lidex gel, which I find work extremely well in stomatitis conditions.  It can be applied t.i.d.  ,Thank you very much for allowing me to share in the care of this pleasant patient.  I will follow her with you a needed. ",1.0

The patient complained of clicking noise and stiffness, which affected his daily activity of living.,PROCEDURE: , After all potential complications, risk a well a anticipated benefit of the above-named procedure wa discussed at length, the patient's informed consent wa obtained.,Operative extremity were then confirmed with the operating surgeon a well a the nursing staff, Department of Anesthesia, and the patient.  The patient wa then transferred to preoperative area to operative suite #2 and placed on the operating room table in supine position.  All bony prominence were well padded at this time.  At this time, Department of Anesthesia administered general anesthetic to the patient.  The patient wa allowed in DVT study and the right extremity wa in the Esmarch study a well a the left.  The nonsterile tourniquet wa then applied to the right upper thigh of the patient, but not inflated at this time.  The right lower extremity wa sterilely prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The right upper extremity wa then elevated and exsanguinated using an Esmarch and the tourniquet wa inflated using 325 mmHg.  The patient wa a consideration for a unicompartmental knee replacement.  So, after all bony and soft tissue landmark were identified, a limited midline longitudinal incision wa made directly over the patella.  A sharp dissection wa then taken down to the level of the fascia in line with the patella a well a the quadriceps tendon.  Next, a medial parapatellar arthrotomy wa performed using the #10 blade scalpel.  Upon viewing of the articular surfaces, there wa significant ware in the trochlear groove a well a the medial femoral condyle and it wa elected to proceed with total knee replacement.  At this time, the skin incision a well a the deep incision were extended proximally and distally in a midline fashion.  Total incision now measured approximately 25 cm.  Retractors were placed.  Next, attention wa directed to establishing medial and lateral flap of the proximal tibia.  Reciprocating osteal elevator wa used to establish soft tissue plane and then an electrocautery wa then used to subperiosteal strip medially and laterally on the proximal tibia.  At this time, the patella wa then everted.  The knee wa flexed up to 90 degrees.  Next, using the large drill bit, the femoral canal wa then opened in appropriate position.  The intramedullary sizing guide wa then placed and the knee wa sized to a size F. At this time, the three degree external rotation hole were then drilled after carefully assessing the epicondylar access a well a the white sideline.  The guide wa then removed.  The intramedullary guide wa then placed with nail holding the guide in three degree of external rotation.  Next, the anterior femoral resection guide wa then placed and clamped into place using a pointed _________________ wa then used to confirm that there would no notching performed.  Next, soft tissue retractor were placed and an oscillating saw wa used to make the anterior femoral cut.  Upon checking, it wa noted to be flat with no oscillations.  The anterior guide wa then removed and the distal femoral resection guide wa placed in five degree of valgus.  It wa secured in place using nails.  The intramedullary guide wa then removed and the standard distal femoral cut wa then made using oscillating saw.,This wa then removed and the size F distal finishing femoral guide wa then placed on the femur in proper position.  Bony and soft tissue landmark were confirmed and the resection guide wa then held in place using nail a well a spring screws.  Again, the collateral ligament retractor were then placed and the oscillating saw wa used to make each of the anterior and posterior a well a each chamfer cut.  A reciprocating saw wa then used to cut the trochlear cut and the peg hole were drilled a well.  The distal finishing guide wa then removed and osteotome wa then used to remove all resected bone.  The oscillating saw wa then used to complete the femoral notch cut.  Upon viewing, there appeared to be proper amount of bony resection and all bone wa removed completely.  There wa no posterior osteophyte noted and no fragment to the posterior aspect.  Next, attention wa directed towards the tibia.  The external tibial guide wa reflected.  This wa placed on the anterior tibia and held in place using nail after confirming the proper varus and valgus position.  The resection guide wa then checked and appeared to be sufficient amount of resection in both medial and lateral condyle of the tibia.  Next, collateral ligament retractor were placed a well a McGill retractor for the PCL.  Oscillating saw wa then used to make the proximal tibial cut.  Osteotome wa used to remove this excess resected bone.  The laminar spreader wa then used to check the flexion and extension.  The gap appeared to be equal.  The external guide wa then removed and trial component were placed to a size F femoral component and a 12 mm tibial component on a size 8 tray.  The knee wa taken through range of motion and had very good flexion a well a full extension.  There appeared to be good varus and valgus stability a well.  Next, attention wa directed towards the patella.  There noted to be a sufficient ware and it wa selected to replace the patella.  It wa sized with caliper, pre-cut and noted to be 26 mm depth.  The sizing guide wa then used and a size 51 resection guide selected.  A 51 mm reamer wa then placed and sufficient amount of patella wa then removed.  The calcar wa then used to check again and there wa noted to be 15 mm remaining.  The 38 mm patella guide wa then placed on the patella.  It wa noted to be in proper size and the three drill hole for the peg were used.  A trial component wa then placed.  The knee wa taken through range of motion.  There wa noted to be some subluxation lateral to the patellar component and a lateral release wa performed.  After this, the component appeared to be tracking very well.  There remained a good range of motion in the knee and extension a well a flexion.  At this time, an AP x-ray of the knee wa taken with the trial component in place.  Upon viewing this x-ray, it appeared that the tibial cut wa in neutral, all component in proper positioning.  The knee wa then copiously irrigated and dried.  The knee wa then flexed ___________ placed, and the peg drill guide wa placed on the tibia in proper position, held in place with nails.,The four peg hole were then drilled.  The knee again wa copiously irrigated and suction dried.  The final component were then selected again consisting of size F femoral components.  A peg size 8 tibial component, a 12 mm height articular surface, size blue, and a 38 mm 9.5 mm thickness All-Poly patella.  Polymethyl methacrylate wa then prepared at this time.  The proximal tibia wa dried and the cement wa then pressed into place.  The cement wa then placed on the backside of the tibial component and the tibial component wa then impacted into proper positioning.  Next, the proximal femur wa cleaned and dried.  Polymethyl methacrylate wa placed on the resected portion of the femur a well a the backside of the femoral components.  This wa then impacted in place a well.  At this time, all excess cement wa removed from both the tibial and femoral components.  A size 12 mm trial tibial articular surface wa then put in place.  The knee wa reduced and held in loading position throughout the remaining drying position of the cement.  Next, the resected patella wa cleaned and dried.  The cement wa placed on the patella a well a the backside of the patellar component.  The component wa then put in proper positioning and held in place with a clamp.  All excess polymethyl methacrylate wa removed from this area a well.  This wa held until the cement had hardened sufficiently.  Next, the knee wa examined.  All excess cement wa then removed.  The knee wa taken through range of motion with sufficient range of motion a well a stability.  The final 12 mm height polyethylene tibial component wa then put into place and snapped down in proper position.  Again range of motion wa noted to be sufficient.  The knee wa copiously irrigated and suction dried once again.  A drain wa then placed within the knee.  The wound wa then closed first using #1 Ethibond to close the arthrotomy oversewn with a #1 Vicryl.  The knee wa again copiously irrigated and dried.  The skin wa closed using #2-0 Vicryl in subcuticular fashion followed by staple on the skin.  The ConstaVac wa then _______ to the drain.  Sterile dressing wa applied consisting of Adaptic, 4x4, ABDs, Kerlix, and a 6-inch Dupre roll from foot to thigh.  Department of Anesthesia then reversed the anesthetic.  The patient wa transferred back to the hospital gurney to Postanesthesia Care Unit.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications. ",2.0

The patient wa noted with acute respiratory distress on ventilator support with both ventilator asynchrony and progressive desaturation.  Chest x-ray a noted above revealed complete atelectasis of the left lung.  The patient wa subsequently sedated and received one dose of paralytic a noted above followed by emergent fiberoptic flexible bronchoscopy.,PROCEDURE DETAIL,:  A bronchoscope wa inserted through the oroendotracheal tube, which wa partially obstructed with blood clots.  These were lavaged with several aliquot of normal saline until cleared.  The bronchoscope required removal because the tissue/clots were obstructing the bronchoscope.  The bronchoscope wa reinserted on several occasion until cleared and advanced to the main carina.  The endotracheal tube wa noted to be in good position.  The bronchoscope wa advanced through the distal trachea.  There wa a white tissue completely obstructing the left main stem at the carina.  The bronchoscope wa advanced to this region and several aliquot of normal saline lavage were instilled and suctioned.  Again this partially obstructed the bronchoscope requiring several time removing the bronchoscope to clear the lumen.  The bronchoscope subsequently wa advanced into the left mainstem and subsequently left upper and lower lobes.  There wa diffuse mucus impactions/tissue a well a intermittent clots.  There wa no evidence of any active bleeding noted.  Bronchoscope wa adjusted and the left lung lavaged until no evidence of any endobronchial obstruction is noted.  Bronchoscope wa then withdrawn to the main carina and advanced into the right bronchial system.  There is no plugging or obstruction of the right bronchial system.  The bronchoscope wa then withdrawn to the main carina and slowly withdrawn a the position of endotracheal tube wa verified, approximately 4 cm above the main carina.  The bronchoscope wa then completely withdrawn a the patient wa maintained on ventilator support during and postprocedure.  Throughout the procedure, pulse oximetry wa greater than 95% throughout.  There is no hemodynamic instability or variability noted during the procedure.  Postprocedure chest x-ray is pending at this time. ",1.0

She is debating whether or not to go back to Dr. XYZ and ask for the nerve block or some treatment modality to stop the pain because she just cannot function on a daily basis and care for her child unless she get something done about this, and she fear these bladder instillation because they do not seem to help.  They seem to be intensifying her pain.  She ha the extra burden of each time she come needing to have pain medication one way or another, thus then we would not allow her to drive under the influence of the pain medicine.

The old right frontal scalp incision wa reopened in a curvilinear manner, and the Bactiseal ventricular catheter wa identified a it went into the right frontal horn.  The distal end of the VA shunt wa flushed and tested with heparinized saline, found to be patent, and it wa then clamped.  Endoscopically, the proximal end wa explored and we found debris within the lumen, and then we were able to freely move the catheter around.  We could see along the tract that the tip of the catheter had gone into the surrounding tissue and appeared to have prong or extension in the tract, which were going into the catheter consistent with partial proximal obstruction.  A Portnoy ventricular catheter wa endoscopically introduced and then the endoscope wa bend so that the catheter tip did not go into the same location where it wa before, but would take a gentle curve going into the right lateral ventricle.  It flushed in quite well, wa left at about 6.5 cm to 7 cm and connected to the existing straight connector and secured with 2-0 Ethibond sutures.  The wound were irrigated out with Bacitracin and closed in a routine manner using two 3-0 Vicryl for the galea and a 4-0 running Monocryl for the scalp followed by Mastisol and Steri-Strips.  The patient wa awakened and extubated having tolerated the procedure well without complications.  It should be noted that the when we were irrigating through the ventricular catheter, fluid easily came out around the catheter indicating that the patient had partial proximal obstruction so that we could probably flow around the old shunt tract and perhaps this wa leading to some of the symptomatology or finding of fluid along the chest.

The 20-gauge spinal needle wa inserted and entered the knee joint.  Approximately, 4 cc of clear yellow fluid wa aspirated.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.,DISPOSITION: , Based upon the appearance of this synovial fluid, we have a very low clinical suspicion of a septic joint.  We will send this fluid to the lab for cell count, crystal exam, a well a culture and Gram stain.  We will follow these results.  After discussion with the emergency department staff, it appears that they tend to try to treat his erythema which appears to be cellulitis with IV antibiotics. ",2.0

Rigid bronchoscopy with removal of foreign body, prolonged procedure taking two hour to remove the stent piecemeal in a very difficult and trying situation.,2.  Excision of granulation tissue tumor.,3.  Bronchial dilation with a balloon bronchoplasty, right main bronchus.,4.  Argon plasma coagulation to control bleeding in the trachea.,5.  Placement of a tracheal and bilateral bronchial stent with a silicon wire stent.,ENDOSCOPIC FINDINGS:,1.  Normal true vocal cords.,2.  Proximal trachea with high-grade occlusion blocking approximately 90% of the trachea due to granulation tissue tumor and break down of metallic stent.,3.  Multiple stent fracture in the mid portion of the trachea with granulation tissue.,4.  High-grade obstruction of the right main bronchus by stent and granulation tissue.,5.  Left main bronchus wa covered by the distal portion of the stent and wa only being ventilated through the strut of the stent.,6.  All in all a high-grade terrible airway obstruction with involvement of the carina, left and right main stem bronchus, mid, distal, and proximal trachea.,TECHNIQUE IN DETAIL: , After informed consent wa obtained from the patient, he wa brought into the operating field.  A rapid sequence induction wa done.  He wa intubated with a rigid scope.  Jet ventilation technique wa carried out using a rigid and flexible scope.  A thorough airway inspection wa carried out with finding a described above.,Dr. D wa present in the operating room and we conferred on operative strategy and agreed that the best of strategy would be to first dilate the right main bronchus, cauterize it to control bleeding and then piecemeal removed the stent from distal to proximal.  This is the technique that wa carried out in a painstaking fashion removing bit of the stent piecemeal with finally getting all of the visible stent out of the airway.  It should be noted that Dr. Donovan and I felt that two of the metallic stent were probably in place but we cannot be sure because of the terrible anatomy and the fact that the stent piece were coming out twisted metal in fragments.  Nevertheless, all the visible stent wa removed, and the airway wa much better after with the dilation of balloon and the rigid scope.  We took measurement and decided to place stent in the trachea, left and right main bronchus using a Dumon Y-stent.  It wa measured 18 mm in tracheal diameter and 14 mm in bronchial diameter.  The right main stem stent wa 2.25 cm in length, the left main stem stent wa 3 cm in length and the tracheal portion wa 9 cm in length.  After it wa placed, excellent placement wa achieved with the proximal end of the stent 3 cm below the true vocal cords.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and wa brought to the recovery room extubated. ",2.0

This wa left in place.,The microscope wa then brought in to use for the remainder of the procedure until closure.  Using a #15 blade, a new durotomy wa then made.  Then, the durotomy wa carried out using Metzenbaum scissors, then reflected the dura anteriorly in a horseshoe manner, placed anteriorly, and this wa done under the operating microscope.  The underlying brain wa quite edematous.,Along the temporal lobe there wa a stain of xanthochromia along the surface.  Thus a corticectomy wa then accomplished using bipolar cautery, and the temporal lobe at this level and the middle temporal gyrus wa entered.  The parenchyma of the brain did not appear normal.  It wa quite vascular.  Furthermore, there wa a hematoma mixed in with the brain itself.  Thus a core biopsy wa then performed in the temporal tip.  The overlying dura wa inspected and it wa quite thickened, approximately 0.25 cm thick, and it wa also highly vascular, and thus a big section of the dura wa also trimmed using bipolar cautery followed by scissors, and several piece of this vascularized dura wa resected for pathology.  Furthermore, sample of the temporal lobe wa cultured.,Hemostasis after evacuation of the intracerebral hematoma using controlled suction a well a significant biopsy of the overlying dura a well a intraparenchymal lesion wa accomplished.  No attempt wa made to enter into the sylvian fissure.  Once hemostasis wa meticulously achieved, the brain wa inspected.  It still wa quite swollen, known that there wa still hematoma in the parenchyma of the brain.  However, at this time it wa felt that since there is no diagnosis made intraoperatively, we would need to stage this surgery further should it be needed once the diagnosis is confirmed.  DuraGen wa then used for duraplasty because of the resected dura.  The bone flap wa then repositioned using Lorenz plating system.  Then a medium Hemovac drain wa placed in subdural space.  Temporalis muscle wa approximated using 2-0 Vicryl.  The galea wa then reapproximated using inverted 2-0 Vicryl.  The scalp wa then reapproximated using staples.  The head wa then dressed and wrapped in a sterile fashion.,She wa witnessed to be extubated in the operating room postoperatively, and she followed command briskly.

He stated that he never had blood in his urine before, however, he doe have a past history of BPH and he had a transurethral resection of prostate more than 10 year ago. He wa admitted to a regular bed. Dr. G of Urology wa consulted for evaluation of his hematuria. During the workup for this, he had a CT of the abdomen and pelvis with and without contrast with early and late-phase imaging for evaluation of the kidney and collecting system. At that time, he wa shown to have multiple bilateral renal cyst with one that did not meet classification a a simple cyst and ultrasound wa recommended.,He had an ultrasound done of the cyst which showed a 2.1 x 2.7 cm mass arising from the right kidney which, again, did not fit ultrasound criterion for a simple cyst and they recommended further evaluation by an MRI a this could be a hemorrhagic cyst or a solid mass or tumor, so an MRI wa scheduled on the day of discharge for further evaluation of this. The report wa not back at discharge. The patient had a cystoscopy and transurethral resection of prostate a well with entire resection of the prostate gland. Pathology on this specimen showed multiple portion of prostatic tissue which wa primarily fibromuscular, and he wa diagnosed with nonprostatic hyperplasia. His urine slowly cleared. He tolerated a regular diet with no difficulty in his activity of daily living, and his Foley wa removed on the day of discharge.,He wa started on ciprofloxacin, Colace, and Lasix after the transurethral resection and continued these for a short course. He is asked to continue the Colace a an outpatient for stool softening for comfort.,DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:, Colace 100 mg 1 b.i.d.,DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP PLANNING:, The patient is to follow up with his primary care physician at ABCD, Dr. B or Dr. J, the patient is unsure of which, in the next couple weeks. He is to follow up with Dr. G of  Urology in the next week by phone in regard to the patient's MRI and plan for a laparoscopic partial renal resection biopsy. This is scheduled for the week after discharge potentially by Dr. G, and the patient will discus the exact time later this week.

3906,"Doctor's Address,Dear Doctor:,This letter serf a a reintroduction of my patient, A, who will be seeing you on Thursday, 06/12/2008.  As you know, he is an unfortunate gentleman who ha reflex sympathetic dystrophy of both lower extremities.  His current symptom are more severe on the right and he ha had a persisting wound that ha failed to heal on his right leg.  He ha been through Wound Clinic to try to help heal this, but wa intolerant of compression dressing and wa unable to get satisfactory healing of this.  He ha been seen by Dr. X for his pain management and wa considered for the possibility of amputation being a therapeutic option to help reduce his pain.  He wa seen by Dr. Y at Orthopedic Associates for review of this.  However, in my discussion with Dr. Z and his evaluation of Mr. A, it wa felt that this may be an imprudent path to take given the lack of likelihood of reduction of his pain from his RST, his questionable healing of his wound given noninvasive study that did reveal tenuous oxygenation of the right lower leg, and concern of worsening of his RST symptom on his left leg if he would have an amputation.  Based on the result of his transcutaneous oxygen level and his dramatic improvement with oxygen therapy at this test, Dr. Z felt that a course of hyperbaric oxygen may be of utility to help in improving his wounds.  As you may or may not know we have certainly pursued aggressive significant measure to try to improve Mr. A's pain.  He ha been to Cleveland Clinic for implantable stimulator, which wa unsuccessful at dramatically improving his pain.  He currently is taking methadone up to eight tablet four time a day, morphine up to 100 mg three time a day, and Dilaudid two tablet by mouth every two hour to help reduce his pain.  He also is currently taking Neurontin 1600 mg three time a day, Effexor XR 250 mg once a day, Cytomel 25 mcg once a day, Seroquel 100 mg p.o. q. day, levothyroxine 300 mcg p.o. q. day, Prinivil 20 mg p.o. q. day, and Mevacor 40 mg p.o. q day.,I appreciate your assistance in determining if hyperbaric oxygen is a reasonable treatment course for this unfortunate situation.  Dr. Z and I have both tried to stress the fact that amputation may be an abrupt and irreversible treatment course that may not reach any significant conclusion.  He ha been evaluated by Dr. X for rehab concern to determine.  He agrees that a le aggressive form of therapy may be most appropriate.,I thank you kindly for your prompt evaluation of this kind gentleman in an unfortunate situation.  If you have any question regarding his care please feel free to call me at my office.  Otherwise, I look forward to hearing back from you shortly after your evaluation.  Please feel free to call me if it is possible or if you have any question about anything. ",2.0

On physical exam, the patient wa found to have grade 3 rectocele and poor apical support, and history of hysterectomy.  The patient had good anterior support at the bladder.  Options were discussed such a watchful waiting, pessary, repair with and without mesh, and closing of the vagina (colpocleisis) were discussed.  Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, morbidity, and mortality of the procedure were discussed., ,Risk of infection and abscess formation were discussed.  The patient understood all the risk and benefit and wanted to proceed with the procedure.  Risk of retention and incontinence were discussed.  Consent wa obtained through the family members.,DETAILS OF THE OR:,  The patient wa brought to the OR.  Anesthesia wa applied.  The patient wa placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient had a Foley catheter placed.  The posterior side of the rectocele wa visualized with grade 3 rectocele and poor apical support.  A 1% lidocaine with epinephrine wa applied for posterior hydrodissection, which wa very difficult to do due to the significant scarring of the posterior part.  Attempts were made to lift the vaginal mucosa off of the rectum, which wa very, very difficult to do at this point due to the patient's overall poor medical condition in term of poor mobility and significant scarring.  Discussion wa done with the family in the waiting area regarding simply closing the vagina and doing a colpocleisis since the patient is actually inactive.  Family agreed that she is not active and they rather not have any major invasive procedure especially in light of scarring and go ahead and perform the colpocleisis.  Oral consent wa obtained from the family and her surgery wa preceded.  The vaginal mucosa wa denuded off using electrocautery and Metzenbaum scissors.  Using 0 Vicryl, 2 transverse longitudinal stitch were placed to bring the anterior and the posterior part of the vagina together and wa started at the apex and wa brought all the way out to the introitus.  The vaginal mucosa wa pretty much completely closed off all the way up to the introitus.  Indigo carmine wa given.  Cystoscopy revealed there wa a good efflux of urine from both of the ureteral openings.  There wa no injury to the bladder or kinking of the ureteral openings.  The bladder wa normal.  Rectal exam wa normal at the end of the colpocleisis repair.  There wa good hemostasis., ,At the end of the procedure, Foley wa removed and the patient wa brought to recovery in a stable condition.

No adnexal masses, however, were appreciated on the bimanual exam.  Laparoscopically, the patient had numerous omental adhesion to the vesicouterine peritoneum in the fundus of the uterus.  There were also adhesion to the left fallopian tube and the right fallopian tube.  There wa a copious amount of blood in the abdomen approximately 2 liter of clotted and unclotted blood.  There wa some questionable gestational tissue ________ on the left sacrospinous ligament.  There wa an apparent rupture and bleeding ectopic pregnancy in the isthmus portion of the right fallopian tube.,PROCEDURE:,  After an informed consent wa obtained, the patient wa taken to the operating room and the general anesthetic wa administered.  She wa then positioned in the dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  Once the anesthetic wa found to be adequate, a bimanual exam wa performed under anesthetic.  A weighted speculum wa then placed in the vagina.  The interior wall of vagina elevated with the uterine sound and the anterior lip of the cervix wa grasped with the vulsellum tenaculum.  The cervix wa then serially dilated with Hank dilator to a size #20 Hank and then a sharp curettage wa performed obtaining a moderate amount of decidual appearing tissue and the tissue wa then sent to pathology.  At this point, the uterine manipulator wa placed in the cervix and attached to the anterior cervix and vulsellum tenaculum and weighted speculum were removed.  Next, attention wa then turned to the abdomen.  The surgeon all are removed the dirty glove in the previous portion of the case.  Next, a 2 cm incision wa made immediately inferior to umbilicus.  The superior aspect of the umbilicus wa grasped with a towel clamp and a Veress needle wa inserted through this incision.  Next, a syringe wa used to inject normal saline into the Veress needle.  The normal saline wa seen to drop freely, so a Veress needle wa connected to the CO2 gas which wa started at it lowest setting.  The gas wa seen to flow freely with normal resistance, so the CO2 gas wa advanced to a higher setting.  The abdomen wa insufflated to an adequate distension.  Once an adequate distention wa reached, the CO2 gas wa disconnected.  The Veress needle wa removed and a size #11 step trocar wa placed.  The introducer wa removed and the trocar wa connected to the CO2 gas and a camera wa inserted.  Next, a 1 cm incision wa made in the midline approximately two fingerbreadth below the pubic symphysis after transilluminating with the camera.  A Veress needle and a step sheath were inserted through this incision.  Next, the Veress needle wa removed and a size #5 trocar wa inserted under direct visualization.  Next a size #5 port wa placed approximately five fingerbreadth to the left of the umbilicus in a similar fashion.  A size #12 port wa placed in a similar fashion approximately six fingerbreadth to the right of the umbilicus and also under direct visualization.  The laparoscopic dissector wa inserted through the suprapubic port and this wa used to dissect the omental adhesion bluntly from the vesicouterine peritoneum and the bilateral fallopian tubes.  Next, the Dorsey suction irrigator wa used to copiously irrigate the abdomen.  Approximate total of 3 liter of irrigation wa used and the majority of all blood clot and free blood wa removed from the abdomen.,Once the majority of blood wa cleaned from the abdomen, the ectopic pregnancy wa easily identified and the end of the fallopian tube wa grasped with the grasper from the left upper quadrant and the LigaSure device wa then inserted through the right upper quadrant with # 12 port.  Three bite with the LigaSure device were used to transect the mesosalpinx inferior to the fallopian tube and then transect the fallopian tube proximal to the ectopic pregnancy.  An EndoCatch bag wa then placed to the size #12 port and this wa used to remove the right fallopian tube and ectopic pregnancy.  This wa then sent to the pathology.  Next, the right mesosalpinx and remains of the fallopian tube were examined again and they were seemed to be hemostatic.  The abdomen wa further irrigated.  The liver wa examined and appeared to be within normal limits.  At this point, the two size #5 port and a size #12 port were removed under direct visualization.  The camera wa then removed.  The CO2 gas wa disconnected and the abdomen wa desufflated.  The introducer wa then replaced in a size #11 port and the whole port and introducer wa removed a a single unit.  All laparoscopic incision were closed with a #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular interrupted fashion.  They were then steri-stripped and bandaged appropriately.  At the end of the procedure, the uterine manipulator wa removed from the cervix and the patient wa taken to Recovery in stable condition.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle count were correct x2.  She wa discharged home with a postoperative hemoglobin of 8.9.  She wa given iron 325 mg to be taken twice a day for five month and Darvocet-N 100 mg to be taken every four to six hour for pain.  She will follow up within a week in the OB resident clinic. ",2.0

Basically the patient state that yesterday she fell and she is not certain about the circumstances, on her driveway, and on her left side hit a rock.  When she came to the emergency room, she wa found to have a rapid atrial tachyarrhythmia, and wa put on Cardizem with reportedly heart rate in the 50s, so that wa stopped.  Review of EKGs from that time show what appears to be multifocal atrial tachycardia with followup EKG showing wandering atrial pacemaker.

She had a followup EKG done at 20:37 on 08/19/08, which show wandering atrial pacemaker and some lateral T-wave changes, not significantly changed from prior.  Followup EKG done this morning show normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs.,IMPRESSION:  ,She is an 84-year-old female with a history of hypertension, severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension and mild aortic stenosis admitted after a fall with left hip fracture and she will require surgery.  Telemetry now reviewed, show predominantly normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs _____ earlier yesterday evening showed burst of multifocal atrial tachycardia and I suspect that wa exacerbated by prior hypokalemia, which ha been corrected.  There ha been no atrial fibrillation documented.  I do not feel these troponins are significant given the stress or fall in prior multifocal atrial tachycardia with increased rate especially in the absence of chest pain or shortness of breath.  She actually describes feeling good exercise capacity prior to this fall.  Given favorable risk to benefit ratio for needed left hip surgery, I feel she may proceed with needed left hip surgery from a cardiac standpoint with continued verapamil, which ha been started, which should help control the multifocal atrial tachycardia, which she had and would watch for heart rate with that.  Continued optimization of electrolytes.  The patient cannot take beta-blockers a previously Toprol reportedly caused shortness of breath, although, there wa some report that it caused bradycardia so we would watch her heart rate on the verapamil.  The patient is aware of the cardiac risks, certainly it is moderate, and wish to proceed with needed surgery.  I do not feel any further cardiac evaluation is needed at this time and the patient may followup with Dr. X after discharge.  Regarding her mild thrombocytopenia, I would defer that to hospitalist and continue proton pump inhibitor for history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, management of left hip fracture a per orthopedist.

3859,"BNP, (brain natriuretic peptide or B-type natriuretic peptide) is a substance produced in the  heart ventricle when there is excessive strain to the heart muscles.  A blood test for this can be used a an effective parameter for detecting an acute event of congestive heart failure, where the heart is unable to pump sufficient amount of blood required by the body's needs.  When a person ha a heart failure (such a MI), BNP is secreted so immensely that it sits well above the measurable range.  Values above 100 signal a problematic situation and those above 500 a highly demanding state.  Note that a person with a remote history of heart problem may not have BNP level elevated, but it is used a a measure of acute events.,On the other hand, ,BMP, or basic metabolic panel is not a single test but a group of 8 test (glucose, calcium, sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, chloride, BUN, creatinine).  Any test that ha the word panel in it is not a single test, so cannot have a single value.,With this logic in mind, if a doctor us phrase like ""BNP/BMP is elevated/negative/positive/is greater than/less than etc."" and then a single value, it may not be BMP.  You can also take the hint from the file whether the patient presented to the hospital with an acute coronary event.  Likewise, if he say multiple value for this test, this must be BMP., ",2.0

Electrophysiological monitoring wa carried out throughout the procedure and remained stable with no undue change reported.,DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION:, After obtaining proper patient identification and appropriate preoperative informed consent, the patient wa taken to the operating room on a hospital stretcher in the supine position. After the induction of satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia and placement of appropriate monitoring equipment by Anesthesiology a well a placement of electrophysiological monitoring equipment by the Neurology team, the patient wa carefully turned to the prone position and placed upon the padded Jackson table with appropriate additional padding placed a needed. The patient's posterior lumbosacral region wa thoroughly cleansed and shaved. The patient wa then scrubbed, prepped and draped in the usual manner. After local infiltration with 1% lidocaine with 1: 200,000 epinephrine solution, a posterior midline skin incision wa made extending from approximately L3 to the inferior aspect of the sacrum. Dissection wa continued in the midline to the level of the posterior fascia. Self-retaining retractor were placed and subsequently readjusted a needed. The fascia wa opened in the midline, and the standard subperiosteal dissection wa then carried out to expose the posterior and posterolateral element from L3-L4 to the sacrum bilaterally with lateral exposure carried out to the lateral aspect of the transverse process of L4 and L5 a well a the sacral ala bilaterally. _____ by completing the exposure, pedicle screw fixation wa carried out in the following manner. Screws were placed in systematic caudal in a cranial fashion. The pedicle screw entry site were chosen using standard dorsal landmark and fluoroscopic guidance a needed. Cortical opening were created at these site using a small burr. The pedicular tract were then preliminarily prepared using a Lenke pedicle finder. They were then probed and subsequently tapped employing fluoroscopic guidance a needed. Each site wa ""under tapped"" and reprobed with satisfactory finding noted a above. Screws in the following dimension were placed. 6.5-mm diameter screw were placed at all sites. At S1, 40-mm length screw were placed bilaterally.

The rod wa then contoured to span from the L4 to the S1 screw on the right. The distraction wa placed across the L4-L5 interspace, and the connection were temporarily secured. Using a matchstick burr, a trough wa then carefully created slightly off the midline of the left lamina extending from it caudal aspect to it more cranial aspect at the foraminal level. This wa longitudinally oriented. A transverse trough wa similarly carefully created from the cranial point of the longitudinal trough out to the lateral aspect of the par against the foraminal level that is slightly caudal to the L4 pedicle. This trough wa completed to the level of the ligamentum flavum using small angled curette and Kerrison rongeurs, and this portion of the lamina along with the inferior L4 articular process wa then removed a a unit using rongeurs and curettes. The cranial aspect of the left L5 superior articular process wa then removed using a small burr and angled curette and Kerrison rongeurs. A superior laminotomy wa performed from the left L5 lamina and flavectomy wa then carried out across this region of decompression, working from caudally to cranially and medially to laterally, again using curette and Kerrison rongeurs under direct visualization. In this manner, the left lateral aspect of the thecal sac passing left L5 spinal nerve and exiting left L4 spinal nerve along with posterolateral aspect of disk space wa exposed. Local epidural vein were coagulated with bipolar and divided. Gelfoam wa then placed in this area. This process wa then repeated in similar fashion; thereby, exposing the posterolateral aspect of the left L5-S1 disk space. As noted, distraction had previously been placed at L4-L5, this wa released. Distraction wa placed across the L5-S1 interspace. After completing satisfactory exposure a noted, a annulotomy wa made in the posterolateral left aspect of the L5-S1 disk space. Intermittent neural retraction wa employed with due caution afforded to the neural element throughout the procedure. The disk space wa entered, and diskectomy wa carried out in routine fashion using pituitary rongeurs followed by the incremental sized disk space shaver a well a straight and then angled TLIF curette to prepare the front plate. Herniated portion of the disk were also removed in routine fashion. The diskectomy and endplate preparation were carried out working progressively from the left towards the right aspect of the disk across the midline in routine fashion. After completing this disk space preparation, Gelfoam wa again placed. The decompression wa assessed and appeared to be satisfactory. The distraction wa released, and attention wa redirected at L4-L5, where again, distraction wa placed and diskectomy and endplate preparation wa carried out at this interspace again in similar fashion. After completing the disk space preparation, attention wa redirected to L5-S1. Distraction wa released at L4-L5 and again, reapplied at L5-S1, incrementally increasing size. Trial space were used, and a 10-mm height by 26-mm length spacer wa chosen. A medium BMP kit wa appropriately reconstituted. A BMP sponge containing morcellated vertebral autograft wa then placed into the anterior aspect of the disk space. The spacer wa then carefully impacted into position. The distraction wa released. The spacer wa checked with satisfactory snugness and positioning noted. This process wa then repeated in similar fashion at L4-L5, again with placement of a 10-mm height by 26-mm length Capstone spacer, again containing BMP and again with initial placement of a BMP sponge with vertebral autograft anteriorly within the interspace. This spacer wa also checked again with satisfactory snugness and positioning noted. The prior placement of the spacers and BMP, the wound wa thoroughly irrigated and dried with satisfactory hemostasis noted. Surgicel wa placed over the exposed dura and disk space. The distraction wa released on the right and compression plate across the L5-S1 and L4-L5 interspaces and the connection fully tightened in routine fashion.

Discussed risks, complications, and consequence of a surgical biopsy of the left true vocal cord and consent wa obtained.,PROCEDURE: , The patient wa brought to operative suite by anesthesia, placed on the operating table in supine position.  After this, the patient wa placed under general endotracheal intubation anesthesia and the operative table wa turned 90 degree by the Department of Anesthesia.  A shoulder roll wa then placed followed by the patient being placed in reverse Trendelenburg.,After this, a mouthguard wa placed in the upper teeth and a Dedo laryngoscope wa placed in the patient's oral cavity and advanced through the oral cavity in the oropharynx down into the hypopharynx.  The patient's larynx wa then brought into view with the true vocal cord hidden underneath what appeared to be redundant false vocal cords.  The left true vocal cord wa then first addressed and appeared to have an extensive area of leukoplakia extending from the posterior one-third up to the anterior third.  The false vocal cord also appeared to be very full on the left side along with fullness in the subglottic region.  The patient's anterior commissure appeared to be clear.  The false cord on the right side also appeared to be very redundant and overshadowing the true vocal cord.  Once the true vocal cord wa retracted laterally, there wa revealed a second area of leukoplakia involving the right true vocal cord in the anterior one-third aspect.  The patient's subglottic region wa very edematous and with redundant mucosal tissue.  The area of leukoplakia appeared to be cobblestoned in appearance, irregularly bordered, and very hard to the touch.  The left true vocal cord wa then first addressed, wa stripped from posteriorly to anteriorly utilizing a #45 laryngeal forceps.  After this, the patient had pressure placed upon this area with tropical adrenaline and a rectal swab to maintain hemostasis.  The specimen wa passed off the field and wa sent to Pathology for evaluation.  Hemostasis wa maintained on the left side.  Prior to taking this biopsy, the Louie arm wa attached to the laryngoscope and then suspended on the Mayo stand.  The Zeiss operating microscope wa then brought into view to directly visualize the vocal cords.  The biopsy were taken under direct visualization utilizing the Zeiss operating microscope.  After the specimen wa taken and the laryngoscope wa desuspended from the Mayo stand and Louie arm wa removed, the scope wa then pulled more cephalad and the piriform sinuses, valecula, and base of the tongue were all directly visualized, which appeared normal except for the left base of tongue appeared to be full.  This area wa biopsied multiple time with a straight laryngeal forceps and passed off the field and sent to Pathology a specimen.  The scope wa then pulled back into the superior aspect of hypopharynx into the oropharynx and the oral cavity demonstrated no sign of any gross lesions.  A bimanual examination wa then performed, which again demonstrated a fullness on the left base of tongue region with no sign of any other gross lesions.  There were no sign of any palpable cervical lymphadenopathy.  The tooth guard wa removed and the patient wa then turned back to anesthesia.

He wa seeing a physician in the city.  They were prescribing methadone for some time.  He say that did help.  He wa on 10 mg of methadone.  He wa on it for three to four months.  He tried to wean down on the methadone a couple of different times, but failed.  He ha been intermittently using heroin.  He say one of the big problem is that he life in a household full of drug user and he could not get away from it.  All that changed now that he is living with his mom.  The last time he did heroin wa about seven to eight day ago.  He ha not had any methadone in about a week either.  He is coming in today specifically requesting methadone.  He also admits to being depressed.  He is sad a lot and down.  He doe not have much energy.  He doe not have the enthusiasm.  He denies any suicidal or homicidal ideation at the present time.  I questioned him on the symptom of bipolar disorder and he doe not seem to have those symptoms.  His past medical history is significant for no medical problems.

There is no evidence of necrotizing fasciitis.,ASSESSMENT: , Substance abuse.,PLAN: , I had a long talk with the patient and his mom.  I am not prescribing him any narcotic or controlled substances.  I am not in the practice of trading one addiction for another.  It ha been one week without any sort of drug at all.  I do not think he need weaning.  I think right now it is mostly psychological, although there still could be some residual physical addiction.  However, once again I do not believe it to be necessary to prescribe him any sort of controlled substance at the present time.  I do believe that his depression need to be treated.  I gave him fluoxetine 20 mg one tablet daily.  I discussed the side effect in detail.  I did also warn him that all antidepressant medication carry an increased risk of suicide.  If he should start to feel any of these symptoms, he should call #911 or go to the emergency room immediately.  If he ha any problem or side effects, he wa also directed to call me here at the office.  After-hours, he can go to the emergency room or call #911.  I am going to see him back in three week for the depression.  I gave him the name and phone number of Behavioral Health and I told him to call so that he can get into rehabilitation program or at least a support group.  We are unable to make a referral for him to do that.  He ha to call on his own.  He ha no insurance.  However, I think fluoxetine is very affordable.  He can get it for $4 per month at Wal-Mart.
