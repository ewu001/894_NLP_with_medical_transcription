Electrical excision of pigmented mole of inner right thigh.,FINDINGS: , There was a 1.5 x 1.5 cm broad-based pigmented nevus on the inner thigh that was excised with a wire loop.  Also, there was a butt-based, 1-cm long endocervical polyp off the posterior lip of the cervix slightly up in the canal.,PROCEDURE: , With the patient in the supine position, general anesthesia was administered.  The patient was put in the dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped for dilatation and curettage in a routine fashion.,An insulated posterior weighted retractor was put in.  Using the LEEP tenaculum, we were able to grasp the anterior lip of the cervix with a large wire loop at 35 cutting, 30 coagulation.  The endocervical polyp on the posterior lip of the cervix was excised.,Then changing from a 50 of coagulation and 5 cutting, the base of the polyp was electrocoagulated, which controlled all the bleeding.  The wire loop was attached, and the pigmented raised nevus on the inner thigh was excised with the wire loop.  Cautery of the base was done, and then it was closed with figure-of-eight 3-0 Vicryl sutures.  A band-aid was applied over this.,Rechecking the cervix, no bleeding was noted.

As soon as satisfactory anesthesia and akinesia had been achieved, the patient was prepped and draped in the usual manner for sterile ophthalmic surgery.  A wire lid speculum was inserted.  Three modified sclerotomies were selected at 9, 10, and 1 o'clock.  At the 9 o'clock position, the Accurus infusion line was put in place and tied with a preplaced #7-0 Vicryl suture.  The two superior sites at 10 and 1 were opened up where the operating microscope with the optical illuminating system was brought into position, and closed vitrectomy was begun.  Initially formed core vitrectomy was performed and formed anterior vitreous was removed.  After this was completed, attention was placed in the posterior segment.  Several broad areas of vitreoretinal traction were noted over the posterior pole out of the equator where the previously noted retinal tears were noted.  These were carefully lifted and dissected off the edges of the flap tears and trimmed to the ora serrata.  After all the vitreous had been removed and the membranes released, the retina was completely mobilized.  Total fluid-air exchange was carried out with complete settling of the retina.  Endolaser was applied around the margins of the retinal tears, and altogether several 100 applications were placed in the periphery.  Good reaction was achieved.  The eye was inspected with an indirect ophthalmoscope.  The retina was noted to be completely attached.  The instruments were removed from the eye.  The sclerotomy sites were closed with #7-0 Vicryl suture.  The infusion line was removed from the eye and tied with a #7-0 Vicryl suture.

1248,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Osteomyelitis, left hallux.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Osteomyelitis, left hallux.,PROCEDURES PERFORMED: , Resection of infected bone, left hallux, proximal phalanx, and distal phalanx.,ANESTHESIA: , TIVA/Local.,HISTORY:,  This 77-year-old male presents to ABCD preoperative holding area after keeping himself NPO since mid night for surgery on his infected left hallux.  The patient has a history of chronic osteomyelitis and non-healing ulceration to the left hallux of almost 10 years' duration.  He has failed outpatient antibiotic therapy and conservative methods.  At this time, he desires to attempt surgical correction.  The patient is not interested in a hallux amputation at this time; however, he is consenting to removal of infected bone.  He was counseled preoperatively about the strong probability of the hallux being a ""floppy tail"" after the surgery and accepts the fact.  The risks versus benefits of the procedure were discussed with the patient in detail by Dr. X and the consent is available on the chart for review.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient's wound was debrided with a #15 blade and down to good healthy tissue preoperatively.  The wound was on the planar medial, distal and dorsal medial.  The wound's bases were fibrous.  They did not break the bone at this point.  They were each approximately 0.5 cm in diameter.  After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the operating table in supine position with safety straps placed across his waist for his protection.,Due to the patient's history of diabetes and marked calcifications on x-ray, a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was not applied.  Next, a total of 3 cc of a 1:1 mixture of 0.5% Marcaine plain and 1% lidocaine plain was used to infiltrate the left hallux and perform a digital block.  Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion.  It was lowered in the operative field and attention was directed to the left hallux after the sterile stockinet was reflected.  Next, a #10 blade was used to make a linear incision approximately 3.5 cm in length along the dorsal aspect of the hallux from the base to just proximal to the eponychium.  Next, the incision was deepened through the subcutaneous tissue.  A heavy amount of bleeding was encountered.  Therefore, a Penrose drain was applied at the tourniquet, which failed.  Next, an Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the distal toes and forefoot and was left in the forefoot to achieve hemostasis.  Any small veins crossing throughout the subcutaneous layer were ligated via electrocautery.  Next, the medial and lateral margins of the incision were under marked with a sharp dissection down to the level of the long extension tendon.  The long extensor tendon was thickened and overall exhibited signs of hypertrophy.  The transverse incision through the long extensor tendon was made with a #15 blade.  Immediately upon entering the joint, yellow discolored fluid was drained from the interphalangeal joint.  Next, the extensor tendon was peeled dorsally and distally off the bone.  Immediately the head of the proximal phalanx was found to be lytic, disease, friable, crumbly, and there were free fragments of the medial aspect of the bone, the head of the proximal phalanx.  This bone was removed with a sharp dissection.  Next, after adequate exposure was obtained and the collateral ligaments were released off the head of proximal phalanx, a sagittal saw was used to resect the approximately one-half of the proximal phalanx.  This was passed off as the infected bone specimen for microbiology and pathology.  Next, the base of the distal phalanx was exposed with sharp dissection and a rongeur was used to remove soft crumbly diseased medial and plantar aspect at the base of distal phalanx.  Next, there was diseased soft tissue envelope around the bone, which was also resected to good healthy tissue margins.  The pulse lavage was used to flush the wound with 1000 cc of gentamicin-impregnated saline.  Next, cleaned instruments were used to take a proximal section of proximal phalanx to label a clean margin.  This bone was found to be hard and healthy appearing.  The wound after irrigation was free of all debris and infected tissue.  Therefore anaerobic and aerobic cultures were taken and sent to microbiology.  Next, OsteoSet beads, tobramycin-impregnated, were placed.  Six beads were placed in the wound.  Next, the extensor tendon was re-approximated with #3-0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous layer was closed with #4-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted technique.  Next, the skin was closed with #4-0 nylon in a horizontal mattress technique.,The Esmarch bandage was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted at the digits.  A standard postoperative dressing was applied consisting of 4 x 4s, Betadine-soaked #0-1 silk, Kerlix, Kling, and a loosely applied Ace wrap.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.  He was transported via a cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit.  His vitals signs were stable and vascular status was intact.  He was given a medium postop shoe that was well-formed and fitting.  He is to elevate his foot, but not apply ice.  He is to follow up with Dr. X.  He was given emergency contact numbers.  He is to continue the Vicodin p.r.n. pain that he was taking previously for his shoulder pain and has enough of the medicine at home.  The patient was discharged in stable condition.",2.0
3364,"CHIEF COMPLAINT:  ,Penile cellulitis status post circumcision.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 16-month-old boy, who had a circumcision performed approximately 4 days before he developed penile swelling and fever and discharge.  The child initially had a newborn circumcision at about 1 week of life and then developed a concealed or buried penis with extra skin and tightness of the skin.  He underwent a second circumcision with a general anesthetic approximately 8 to 9 days ago.  The mother states that on Thursday, he developed fairly significant swelling, scrotum was also swollen, the suprapubic region was swollen, and he was having a purulent discharge and a fairly significant fever to 102 to 103.  He was seen at Hospital, transferred to Children's Hospital for further care.  Since being hospitalized, his cultures apparently have grown Staph but is unknown yet whether it is methicillin-resistant.  He has been placed on clindamycin, and he is now currently afebrile and with marked improvement according to the mother.  I was requested a consultation by Dr. X because of the appearance of penis.  The patient has been voiding without difficulty throughout.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , The patient has no known allergies.  He was a term delivery via vaginal delivery.  Surgeries; he has had 2 circumcisions.  No other hospitalizations.  He has had no heart murmurs, seizures, asthma, or bronchitis.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , A 14-point review of systems was negative with the exception of the penile and scrotal cellulitis and the surgeries as mentioned.  He also had an ear infection about 1 to 2 weeks before his circumcision.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient lives with both parents and no siblings.  There are smokers at home.,MEDICATIONS: , Clindamycin and bacitracin ointment.  Also Bactrim.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS:  Weight is 14.9 kg.,GENERAL:  The patient was sleepy but easily arousable.,HEAD AND NECK:  Grossly normal.  His neck and chest are without masses.,NARES:  He had some crusted nares; otherwise, no other discharge.,LUNGS:  Clear.,CARDIAC:  Without murmurs or gallops.,ABDOMEN:  Soft without masses or tenderness.,GU:  He has a fairly prominent suprapubic fat pad, and he is quite a large child in any event; however, there were no signs of erythema.  There was some induration around the penis; however, there were no signs of active infection.  He has a buried appearance of the penis after recent circumcision with a normal appearing glans.  The tissue itself, however, was quite dull and is soft or readily retractable at this time.  The scrotum was normal, and there was no erythema, there was no tenderness.  Both testes were descended without hydroceles.,EXTREMITIES:  He has full range of motion of all 4 extremities.,SKIN:  Warm, pink, and dry.,NEUROLOGIC:  Grossly intact.,BACK:  Normal.,IMPRESSION/PLAN: , The patient had a recent circumcision with a fairly prominent suprapubic fat pad but also has a penile and suprapubic cellulitis.  This is being treated, but it is most likely Staph and pending sensitivities.  I talked to the mother and told her that at this point the swelling that is present is a mixture of the resolving cellulitis from a suprapubic fat pad.  I recommended that he be treated most likely with Bactrim for a 10-day course at home, bacitracin, or some antibiotics ointment to the penis with each diaper change for the next 2 to 3 weeks with sitz bath once or twice a day.  I told the mother that initially the tissues are going to be quite dull because of the infection and the recent surgery, but she ultimately will have to gently retract the skin to keep it from adhering again because of the prominent suprapubic fat pad, which makes it more likely.  Otherwise, it is a fairly healthy-appearing tissue at the present time and she knows the reasons that he cannot be discharged once the hospitalist service believes that it is appropriate to do so.  He has a scheduled followup appointment with his urologist  and he should keep that appointment or followup sooner if there is any other problem arising.",2.0

He tolerated the procedure well.,DETAILS OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position.  Following general endotracheal anesthesia, the chest was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The previously placed AlloDerm membrane was removed.  Mediastinal cultures were obtained, and the mediastinum was then profusely irrigated and suctioned.  Both cavities were also irrigated and suctioned.  The drains were flushed and repositioned.  Approximately 30 cubic centimeters of blood were drawn slowly from the right atrial line.  The sternum was then smeared with a vancomycin paste.  The proximal aspect of the 5 mm RV-PA conduit was marked with a small titanium clip at its inferior most aspect and with an additional one on its rightward inferior side.  The sternum was then closed with stainless steel wires followed by closure of subcutaneous tissues with interrupted monofilament stitches.  The skin was closed with interrupted nylon sutures and a sterile dressing was placed.  The peritoneal dialysis catheter, atrial and ventricular pacing wires were removed.

Rheumatoid arthritis.,4.  Suspected mild stress-induced adrenal insufficiency.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , This very independent 79-year old had struggled with cough, fevers, weakness, and chills for the week prior to admission.  She was seen on multiple occasions at Urgent Care and in her physician's office.  Initial x-ray showed some mild diffuse patchy infiltrates.  She was first started on Avelox, but had a reaction, switched to Augmentin, which caused loose stools, and then three days prior to admission was given daily 1 g Rocephin and started on azithromycin.  Her O2 saturations drifted downward.  They were less than 88% when active; at rest, varied between 88% and 92%.  Decision was made because of failed outpatient treatment of pneumonia.  Her medical history is significant for rheumatoid arthritis.  She is on 20 mg of methotrexate every week as well as Remicade every eight weeks.  Her last dose of Remicade was in the month of June.  Hospital course was relatively unremarkable.  CT scan was performed and no specific focal pathology was seen.  Dr. X, pulmonologist was consulted.  He also was uncertain as to the exact etiology, but viral etiology was most highly suspected.  Because of her loose stools, C. difficile toxin was ordered, although that is pending at the time of discharge.  She was continued on Rocephin IV and azithromycin.  Her fever broke 18 hours prior to discharge, and O2 saturations improved, as did her overall strength and clinical status.  She was instructed to finish azithromycin.  She has two pills left at home.  She is to follow up with Dr. X in two to three days.  Because she is on chronic prednisone therapy, it was suspected that she was mildly adrenal insufficient from the stress of her pneumonia.  She is to continue the increased dose of prednisone at 20 mg (up from 5 mg per day).  We will consult her rheumatologist as to whether to continue her methotrexate, which we held this past Friday.  Methotrexate is known on some occasions to cause pneumonitis.",1.0

4110,"PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,While in the holding area, the patient received a peripheral IV from the nursing staff.  In addition, pilocarpine 1% was placed into the operative eye, two times, separated by 10 minutes.  The patient was wheeled to the operating suite where the anesthesia team established peripheral monitoring lines.  Through the IV, the patient received IV sedation in the form of propofol and once somnolent from this, a retrobulbar block was administrated consisting of 2% Xylocaine plain.  Approximately 3 mL were administered.  The patient then underwent a Betadine prep with respect to the face, lens, lashes, and eye.  During the draping process, care was taken to isolate the lashes.  A Vicryl traction suture was placed through the superior cornea and the eye was reflected downward to expose the superior temporal conjunctiva.  Approximately 8 to 10 mm posterior to limbus, the conjunctiva was incised and dissected forward to the limbus.  Blunt dissection was carried out in the superotemporal quadrant.  Next, a 2 x 3-mm scleral flap was outlined that was one-half scleral depth in thickness.  This flap was cut forward to clear cornea using a crescent blade.  The Ahmed shunt was then primed and placed in the superior temporal quadrant and it was sutured in place with two 8-0 nylon sutures.  The knots were trimmed.  The tube was then cut to an appropriate length to enter the anterior chamber.  The anterior chamber was then entered after a paracentesis wound had been made temporally.  A trabeculectomy was done and then the tube was threaded through the trabeculectomy site.  The tube was sutured in place with a multi-wrapped 8-0 nylon suture.  The scleral flap was then sutured in place with two 10-0 nylon sutures.  The knots were trimmed, rotated and buried.  A scleral patch was then placed of an appropriate size over the two.  It was sutured in place with interrupted 8-0 nylon sutures.  The knots were trimmed.  The overlying conjunctiva was then closed with a running 8-0 Vicryl suture with a BV needle.  The anterior chamber was filled with Viscoat to keep it deep as the eye was somewhat soft.  A good flow was established with irrigation into the anterior chamber.  Homatropine, Econopred, and Vigamox drops were placed into the eye.  A patch and shield were placed over the eye after removing the draping and the speculum.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  He was taken to the recovery in good condition.  He will be seen in followup in the office tomorrow.",2.0

A 6-French arterial sheath was placed in the usual fashion.  Left and right coronary angiograms were then performed in various projections after heparin was given 2000 units intraaortic.  The right coronary artery was difficult to cannulate because of its high anterior takeoff.  This was nondominant.  Several catheters were used.  Ultimately, an AL1 diagnostic catheter was used.  A pigtail catheter was advanced across the aortic valve.  Left ventriculogram was then done in the RAO view using 30 mL of contrast.  Pullback gradient was obtained across the aortic valve.  Femoral angiogram was performed through the sheath which was above the bifurcation, was removed with a Perclose device with good results.  There were no complications.  He tolerated this procedure well and returned to his room in good condition.,FINDINGS,1.  Right coronary artery:  This has an unusual high anterior takeoff.  The vessel is nondominant, has diffuse mild-to-moderate disease.,2.  Left main trunk:  A 30% to 40% distal narrowing is present.,3.  Left anterior descending:  Just at the ostium of the vessel and up to and including the bifurcation of the first large diagonal branch, there is 80 to 90% narrowing.  The diagonal is a large vessel about 3 mm in size.,4.  Circumflex:  Dominant vessel, 50% narrowing at the origin of the obtuse marginal.  After this, there is 40% narrowing in the AV trunk.  The small posterior lateral branch has diffuse mild disease and then the vessel gives rise to a fairly large posterior ventricular branch, which has 70% ostial narrowing, and then after this the posterior descending has 80% narrowing at its origin.,5.  Left ventriculogram:  Normal volume in diastole and systole.  Normal systolic function is present.  There is no mitral insufficiency or left ventricular outflow obstruction.,DIAGNOSES,1.  Severe complex left anterior descending and distal circumflex disease with borderline, probably moderate narrowing of a large obtuse marginal branch.  Dominant circumflex system.  Severe disease of the posterior descending.  Mild left main trunk disease.,2.  Normal left ventricular systolic function.,Given the complex anatomy of the predominant problem which is the left anterior descending; given its ostial stenosis and involvement of the bifurcation of the diagonal, would recommend coronary bypass surgery.

After adequate anesthesia via endotracheal intubation, the nose was prepped with Afrin nasal spray.  After this was done, 1% Xylocaine with 100,000 epinephrine was infiltrated in both sides of the septum and the mucoperichondrium.  After this, the sinus endoscope at 25-degrees was then used to examine the nasal cavity in the left nasal cavity and staying lateral to the middle turbinate.  A 45-degree forceps then used to open up the maxillary sinus.  There was some prominent tissue and just superior to this, the anterior ethmoid was opened.  The 45-degree forceps was then used to open the maxillary sinus ostium.  This was enlarged with backbiting rongeur.  After this was done, the tissue found in the ethmoid and maxillary sinus were removed and sent to pathology and labeled as left maxillary sinus mucosa.  After this was done, attention was then turned to the right nasal cavity staying laterally to the middle turbinate.  There was noted to have prominence in the anterior ethmoidal area.  This was then opened with 45-degree forceps.  This mucosa was then removed from the anterior area.  The maxillary sinus ostium was then opened with 45-degree forceps.  Tissue was removed from this area.  This was sent as right maxillary mucosa.  After this, the backbiting rongeur was then used to open up the ostium and enlarge the ostium on the right maxillary sinus.  Protecting the eyes with wet gauze and using KTP laser at 10 watts, the sinus endoscope was used for observation and the submucosal resection was done of both inferior turbinates as well as anterior portion of the middle turbinates bilaterally.  This was to open up to expose the maxillary ostium as well as other sinus ostium to minimize swelling and obstruction.  After this was completed, a septoplasty was performed.  The incision was made with a #15 blade Bard-Parker knife.  The flap was then elevated, overlying the spur that was protruding into the right nasal cavity.  This was excised with a #15 blade Bard-Parker knife.  The tissue was then laid back in position.  After this was laid back in position, the nasal cavity was irrigated with saline solution, suctioned well as well as the oropharynx.  , ,Surgicel with antibiotic ointment was placed in each nostril and sutured outside the nose with 3-0 nylon.

All risks and benefits were explained.  Questions answered.  Options discussed.  No guarantees were made.  She wished to proceed with surgery.,PROCEDURE: , After administering appropriate antibiotics and MAC anesthesia, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual standard fashion, the arm was exsanguinated with Esmarch, and the tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg.,I made a transverse incision one fingerbreadth proximal to the distal volar wrist crease.  Dissection was carried down to the antebrachial fascia, which was cut in a distally based fashion.  Bipolar electrocautery was used to maintain meticulous hemostasis.  I then performed an antebrachial fasciotomy proximally.  I entered the extra bursal space deep into the transverse carpal ligament and used the spatula probe and then the dilators and then the square probe to enlarge the area.  Great care was taken to feel the washboard undersurface of the transverse carpal ligament and the hamate on the ulnar side.  Great care was taken with placement.  A good plane was positively identified.  I then placed the endoscope in and definitely saw the transverse striations of the deep surface of the transverse carpal ligament.,Again, I felt the hook of the hamate ulnar to me.  I had my thumb on the distal aspect of the transverse carpal ligament.  I then partially deployed the blade, and starting 1 mm from the distal edge, the transverse carpal ligament was positively identified.  I pulled back and cut and partially tightened the transverse carpal ligament.  I then feathered through the distal ligament and performed a full-thickness incision through the distal half of the ligament.  I then checked to make sure this was properly performed and then cut the proximal aspect.  I then entered the carpal tunnel again and saw that the release was complete, meaning that the cut surfaces of the transverse carpal ligament were separated; and with the scope rotated, I could see only one in the field at a time.  Great care was taken and at no point was there any longitudinal structure cut.  Under direct vision through the incision, I made sure that the distal antebrachial fascia was cut.  Following this, I irrigated and closed the skin.  The patient was dressed and sent to the recovery room in good condition.",2.0

235,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Blocked ventriculoperitoneal shunt.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Blocked ventriculoperitoneal shunt.,PROCEDURE: , Ventriculoperitoneal shunt revision with replacement of ventricular catheter and flushing of the distal end.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,HISTORY: , The patient is nonverbal.  He is almost 3 years old.  He presented with 2 months of irritability, vomiting, and increasing seizures.  CT scan was not conclusive, but shuntogram shows no flow through the shunt.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , After induction of general anesthesia, the patient was placed supine on the operating room table with his head turned to the left.  Scalp was clipped.  He was prepped on the head, neck, chest and abdomen with ChloraPrep.  Incisions were infiltrated with 0.5% Xylocaine with epinephrine 1:200,000.  He received oxacillin.,He was then reprepped and draped in a sterile manner.,The frontal incision was reopened and extended along the valve.  Subcutaneous sharp dissection with Bovie cautery was done to expose the shunt parts.  I separated the ventricular catheter from the valve, and this was a medium pressure small contour Medtronic valve.  There was some flow from the ventricular catheter, but not as much as I would expect.  I removed the right-angled clip with a curette and then pulled out the ventricular catheter, and there was gushing of CSF under high pressure.  So, I do believe that the catheter was obstructed, although inspection of the old catheter holes did not show any specific obstructions.  A new Codman BACTISEAL catheter was placed through the same hole.  I replaced it several times because I wanted to be sure it was in the cavity.  It entered easily and there was still just intermittent flow of CSF.  The catheter irrigated very well and seemed to be patent.,I tested the distal system with an irrigation filled feeding tube, and there was excellent flow through the distal valve and catheter.  So I did not think it was necessary to replace those at this time.  The new catheter was trimmed to a total length of 8 cm and attached to the proximal end of the valve.  The valve connection was secured to the pericranium with a #2-0 Ethibond suture.  The wound was irrigated with bacitracin irrigation.  The shunt pumped and refilled well.  The wound was then closed with #4-0 Vicryl interrupted galeal suture and Steri-Strips on the skin.  It was uncertain whether this will correct the problem or not, but we will continue to evaluate.  If his abdominal pressure is too high, then he may need a different valve.  This will be determined over time, but at this time, the shunt seemed to empty and refill easily.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  No complications.  Sponge and needle counts were correct.  Blood loss was minimal.  None replaced.",2.0

The patient was given sedation and monitored.  Local anesthetic was used to insufflate the skin and paraspinal tissues and the L5 disk level on the right was noted to be completely collapsed with no way whatsoever to get a needle to the neural foramen of the L5 root.  The left side was quite open; however, that was not the side of her problem.  At this point using a oblique fluoroscopic projection and gun-barrel technique, a 22-gauge 3.5 inch spinal needle was placed at the superior articular process of L5 on the right, stepped off laterally and redirected medially into the intervertebral foramen to the L4 nerve root.  A second needle was taken and placed at the S1 nerve foramen using AP and lateral fluoroscopic views to confirm location.  After negative aspiration, 2 cc of Omnipaque 240 dye was injected through each needle.,There was a defect flowing in the medial epidural space at both sides.  There were no complications.",2.0
2197,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , This is a 76-year-old female that was admitted with fever, chills, and left pelvic pain.  The patient was well visiting in ABC, with her daughter that evening.  She had pain in her left posterior pelvic and low back region.  They came back to XYZ the following day.  By the time they got here, she was in severe pain and had fever.  They came straight to the emergency room.  She was admitted.  She had temperature of 104 degrees F.  It has been spiking ever since and she has had left sacroiliac type hip pain.  Multiple blood studies have been done including cultures, febrile agglutinins, etc.  She has had run a higher blood glucose to the normal and she has been on sliding scale insulin.  She was not known previously to be a diabetic.  All x-rays have not been helpful as far as to determine the etiology of her discomfort.  MRIs of the lumbar spine and the pelvis and both thighs have been unremarkable for any inflammatory process.  She does have degenerative disk disease of her lumbar spine but no hip pathology.  She has swollen inguinal nodes bilaterally.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY AND REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , She was not known to be a diabetic until this admission.  She had been hypertensive.  She has been on medications and has been controlled.  She has not had hyperlipidemia.  She has had no thyroid problems.  There has been no asthma, bronchitis, TB, emphysema or pneumonia.  No tuberculosis.  She has had no breast tumors.  She has had no chest pain or cardiac problems.  She has had gallbladder surgery.  She has not had any gastritis or ulcers.  She has had no kidney disease.  She has had a hysterectomy.  She has had 9 pregnancies and 8 living children.  She had A&P repair.  She had a sacral abscess after a spinal.  It sounds to me like she had a pilonidal cyst, which took about 3 operations to heal.  There have been fractures and no significant arthritis.  She has been quite active at her ranch in Mexico.  She raises goats and cattle.  She drives a tractor and in short, has been very active.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,  She is a short female, alert.  She is shivering.  She has ice in her axilla and behind her neck.  She is febrile to 101 degrees F. She is alert.  Her complaint is that of hip pain in the posterior sacroiliac joint area.  She moves both her upper extremities well.  She can move her right leg well.  She actually can move her left hip and knee without much discomfort but the pain radiates from her sacroiliac joint.  She cannot stand, sit or turn without severe pain.  She has normal knee reflexes.  No ankle reflexes.  She has bounding tibial pulses.  No sensory deficit.  She says she knows when she has to void.  She has a healed scar in the upper sacral region.  There is some bruising around the buttocks but the daughter says that is from her being in bed lying on her back.,PLAN: , My plan is to do a triple-phase bone scan.  I am suspecting an infection possibly in the left sacroiliac joint.  It is probably some type of bacterium, the etiology of which is undetermined.  She has had a normal white count despite her fever.  There has been a history of brucellosis in the past, but her titers at this time are negative.  Continue medication which included antibiotics and also the Motrin and Darvocet.,",1.0

Right ureterorenoscopy, diagnostic.,ANESTHESIA: , Spinal.,SPECIMEN TO PATHOLOGY: , Urine and saline wash barbotage from right ureter through the ureteral catheter.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  ,Minimal.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , This is a 70-year-old female who reports progressive intermittent right flank pain associated with significant discomfort and disability.  She presented to the emergency room where she was found to have significant hydronephrosis on the right without evidence of a stone.  She has some ureteral thickening in her distal right ureter.  She has persistent microscopic hematuria and her urine cytology and cytomolecular diagnosis significant for urothelial dysplasia with neoplasia-associated karyotypic profile.  She was brought to the operating room for further evaluation and treatment.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: , After preoperative counseling, the patient was taken to the operating room and administered a spinal anesthesia.  She was placed in the lithotomy position, prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The 21-French cystoscope was inserted per urethra into the bladder.  The bladder was inspected and found to be without evidence of intravesical tumors, stones or mucosal abnormalities.  The right ureteral orifice was visualized and cannulated with an open-ended ureteral catheter.  This was gently advanced to the mid ureter.  Urine was collected for cytology.  Retrograde injection of saline through the ureteral catheter was then also used to enhance collection of the specimen.  This too was collected and sent for a pooled urine cytology as specimen from the right renal pelvis and ureter.  An 0.038 guidewire was then passed up through the open-ended ureteral catheter.  The open-ended ureteral catheter and cystoscope were removed, and over the guidewire the flexible ureteroscope was passed up to the level of the renal pelvis.  Using direct vision and fluoroscopy to confirm location, the entire renal pelvis and calyces were inspected.  The renal pelvis demonstrated an extrarenal pelvis, but no evidence of obstruction at the renal UPJ level.  There were no intrapelvic or calyceal stones.  The ureter demonstrated no significant mucosal abnormalities, no visible tumors, and no areas of apparent constriction on multiple passes of the ureteroscope through the ureter to evaluate.  The ureteroscope was then removed.  The cystoscope was reinserted.  Once again, retrograde injection of contrast through an open-ended ureteral catheter was undertaken in the right ureter and collecting system.  No evidence of extravasation or significant change in anatomy was visualized.  The left ureteral orifice was then visualized and cannulated with an open-ended ureteral catheter, and retrograde injection of contrast demonstrated a normal left ureter and collecting system.  The cystoscope was removed.  Foley catheter was inserted.  The patient was placed in the supine position and transferred to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.",2.0
937,"ASH SPLIT VENOUS PORT,PROCEDURE DETAILS:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in supine position and monitored anesthesia care provided by the anesthetist.  The right anterior chest and supraclavicular fossa area, neck, and left side of chest were prepped with Betadine and draped in a sterile fashion.  Xylocaine 1% was infiltrated in the supraclavicular area and anterior chest along the planned course of the catheter.  The patient was placed into Trendelenburg position.,The right internal jugular vein was accessed by a supraclavicular 19-gauge, thin-walled needle as demonstrated by easy withdrawal of venous blood on the first pass of the needle.  Under fluoroscopic control, a J-wire was advanced into the right atrium.  The needle was removed and the skin puncture site enlarged to about 8 mm with the scalpel.  A second incision was made 5 cm inferior to the right midclavicular line, through which an Ash split catheter was advanced, using the tunneling rod, in a gently curving pass to exit the skin of the neck incision.  The tunneling needle was removed and the catheter split up to the marker as indicated in the recommended use of the catheter.,Sequential dilators were advanced over the J-wire under fluoroscopic control to dilate the subcutaneous tunnel followed by advancement of a dilator and sheath into the right superior vena cava under fluoroscopic control.  The dilator and wire were removed, leaving the sheath in position, through which a double-lumen catheter was advanced into the central venous system.  The sheath was peeled away, leaving the catheter into position.  Each port of the catheter was flushed with dilute heparinized saline.,The patient was returned to the flat position.  The catheter was secured to the skin of the anterior chest using 2-0 Ethilon suture placed through the suture ""wings."",The neck incision was closed with 3-0 Vicryl subcuticular closure and pressure dressing applied.

The opportunity for questions was provided, and informed consent was obtained.  Once the consent was obtained, the patient was sedated with IV medications and intubated by Dr. Fernandez and placed in the supine position.  Then, the tip of the XP-160 videoscope was introduced into the oropharynx, and under direct visualization, we could advance the endoscope into the upper, mid, and lower esophagus.  We did not find any strictures in the upper esophagus, but the patient had the lower esophageal sphincter totally loose.  Then the tip of the endoscope was advanced down into the stomach and guided into the pylorus, and then into the first portion of the duodenum.  We noticed that the patient had several ulcers in the first portion of the duodenum.  Then the tip of the endoscope was advanced down into the second portion of the duodenum, one biopsy was taken there, and then, the tip of the endoscope was brought back to the first portion, and two biopsies were taken there.  Then, the tip of the endoscope was brought back to the antrum, where two biopsies were taken, and one biopsy for CLOtest.  By retroflexed view, at the level of the body of the stomach, I could see that the patient had the lower esophageal sphincter loose.  Finally, the endoscope was unflexed and was brought back to the lower esophagus, where two biopsies were taken.  At the end, air was suctioned from the stomach, and the endoscope was removed out of the patient's mouth.  The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications.,FINAL IMPRESSION:  ,1.

The patient has been NPO since mid night.  Consent is signed and in the chart.  No known drug allergies.,Details Of Procedure:  An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area.  The patient was transported to the operating room and placed on the operating table in supine position with a safety belt across the stomach.  Copious amounts of Webril were placed on the left ankle followed by blood pressure cuff.  After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 10 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected into the surgical site both medially and laterally across the plantar fascia.  The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.  An Esmarch bandage was applied for exsanguination and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was then reflected on the operating, stockinet reflected, and the foot cleansed with a wet and dry sponge.  Attention was then directed to the plantar medial aspect of the left heel.  An approximately 0.75 cm incision was then created in the plantar fat pad over the area of maximal tenderness.,The incision was then deepened with a combination of sharp and blunt dissection until the plantar fascia was palpated.  A #15 blade was then used to transect the medial and central bands of the plantar fascia.  Care was taken to preserve the lateral fibroids.  The foot was dorsiflexed against resistance as the fibers were released and there was noted to be increased laxity after release of the fibers on the plantar aspect of the foot indicating that plantar fascia has in fact been transacted.  The air was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  The skin incision was then closed with #3-0 nylon in simple interrupted fashion.  Dressings consisted of #0-1 silk, 4 x 4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted throughout all digits of the left foot.  The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications.  The patient was transported to the PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the left foot.  Intraoperatively, an additional 80 cc of 1% lidocaine was injected for additional anesthesia in the case.  The patient is to be nonweightbearing on the left lower extremity with crutches.

He is status post small bowel resection.  We plan to go back to operating room tomorrow for further debridement and possible closure.  Neurologically, the patient initially had question of encephalopathy while in the hospital secondary to slow awakening after previous intubation; however, he did clear eventually, and was able to follow commands.  I did not suspect any sort of pathologic abnormality of his neurologic status as he has further CT scan of his brain, which was normal.  Currently, we will keep him sedated and on fentanyl drip to ease pain and facilitate ventilation on the respirator.  We will form daily sedation holidays to assess his neurologic status and avoid over sedating with Ativan.,1.  Cardiovascular.  The patient currently is in septic shock requiring vasopressors maintained on MAP greater than 70.  We will continue to try to wean the vasopressin after continued volume loading, also place SvO2 catheter to assess his oxygen delivery and consumption given his state of shock.  Currently, his rhythm is of sinus tachycardia, I do not suspect AFib or any other arrhythmia at this time.  If he does not improve as expected with volume resuscitation and with resolution of his sepsis, we will obtain an echocardiogram to assess his cardiac function.  Once he is off the vasopressors, we will try low-dose beta blockade as tolerated to reduce his rate.,2.  Pulmonology.  Currently, the patient is on full vent support with a rate of 20, tidal volume of 550, pressure support of 10, PEEP of 6, and FiO2 of 60.  We will wean his FiO2 as tolerated to keep his saturation greater than 90% and wean his PEEP as tolerated to reduce preload compromise.  We will keep the head of bed elevated and start chlorhexidine as swish and swallow for VAP prevention.,3.  Gastrointestinal.  The patient has known mesenteric venous occlusion secondary to the thrombus formation at the portal vein as well as the SMV.  He is status post immediate resection of jejunum leaving a blind proximal jejunum and blind distal jejunum.  We will maintain NG tube as he has a blind stump there, and we will preclude any further administration of any meds through this NG tube.  I will keep him on GI prophylaxis as he is intubated.  We will currently hold his TPN as he is undergoing a large amount of volume changes as well as he is undergoing electrolyte changes.  He will have a long-term TPN after this acute episode.  His LFTs are all normal currently.  Once he is postop tomorrow, we will restart the Angiomax for his venous occlusion.,4.  Renal.  The patient currently is in the acute renal insufficiency with anuria and an increase in his creatinine as well as his potassium.  His critical hyperkalemia which is requiring dosing of dextrose insulin, bicarb, and calcium; we will recheck his potassium levels after this cocktail.  He currently is started to make more urine since being volume resuscitated with Hespan as well as bicarb drip.  Hopefully given his increased urine output, he will start to eliminate some potassium and will not need dialysis.  We will re-consult Nephrology at this time.,5.  Endocrine.  The patient has adrenal insufficiency based on lack of stem to cosyntropin.  We will start hydrocortisone 50 q.6h.,6.  Infectious Disease.  Currently, the patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis imperially.  Given his bowel ischemia, we will continue these, and appreciate ID service's input.,7.  Hematology.  Hematologically, the patient has a hypercoagulable syndrome, also had HIT secondary to his heparin administration.  We will restart the Angiomax once he is back from the OR tomorrow.  Currently, his INR is 2.2.  Therefore, he should be covered at the moment.

The patient was given Ancef preop antibiotic.  Ancef irrigation was used throughout the procedure.,BRIEF HISTORY: , The patient is a 63-year-old female who presented to us with urgency and frequency on physical exam.  There was no evidence of cystocele or rectocele.  On urodyanamcis, the patient has significant overactivity of the bladder.  The patient was tried on over three to four different anticholinergic agents such as Detrol, Ditropan, Sanctura, and VESIcare for at least one month each.  The patient had pretty much failure from each of the procedure.  The patient had less than 20% improvement with anticholinergics.  Options such as continuously trying anticholinergics, continuation of the Kegel exercises, and trial of InterStim were discussed.  The patient was interested in the trial.  The patient had percutaneous InterStim trial in the office with over 70% to 80% improvement in her urgency, frequency, and urge incontinence.  The patient was significantly satisfied with the results and wanted to proceed with stage I and II neuromodulator.  Risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, and PE were discussed.  Risk of failure of the procedure in the future was discussed.,Risk of lead migration that the treatment may or may not work in the long-term basis and data on the long term were not clear were discussed with the patient.  The patient understood and wanted to proceed with stage I and II neuromodulator.  Consent was obtained.,DETAILS OF THE OPERATION: , The patient was brought to the OR.  The patient was placed in prone position.  A pillow was placed underneath her pelvis area to slightly lift the pelvis up.  The patient was awake, was given some MAC anesthesia through the IV, but the patient was talking and understanding and was able to verbalize issues.  The patient's back was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Lidocaine 1% was applied on the right side near the S3 foramen.  Under fluoroscopy, the needle placement was confirmed.  The patient felt stimulation in the vaginal area, which was tapping in nature.  The patient also had a pressure feeling in the vaginal area.  The patient had no back sensation or superficial sensation.  There was no sensation down the leg.  The patient did have __________, which turned in slide bellows response indicating the proper positioning of the needle.  A wire was placed.  The tract was dilated and lead was placed.  The patient felt tapping in the vaginal area, which is an indication that the lead is in its proper position.  Most of the leads had very low amplitude and stimulation.  Lead was tunneled under the skin and was brought out through an incision on the left upper buttocks.  Please note that the lidocaine was injected prior to the tunneling.  A pouch was created about 1 cm beneath the subcutaneous tissue over the muscle where the actual unit was connected to the lead.  Screws were turned and they were dropped.  Attention was made to ensure that the lead was all the way in into the InterStim.  Irrigation was performed after placing the main unit in the pouch.  Impedance was checked.  Irrigation was again performed with antibiotic irrigation solution.  The needle site was closed using 4-0 Monocryl.

Distal metaphyseal osteotomy and bunionectomy with internal screw fixation, right foot.,2.  Reposition osteotomy with internal screw fixation to correct angulation deformity of proximal phalanx, right foot.,ANESTHESIA:,Local infiltrate with IV sedation.,INDICATION FOR SURGERY: , The patient has had a longstanding history of foot problems.  The foot problem has been progressive in nature and has not been responsive to conservative treatment.  The preoperative discussion with the patient included the alternative treatment options.,The procedure was explained in detail and risk factors such as infection, swelling, scarred tissue; numbness, continued pain, recurrence, and postoperative management were explained in detail.  The patient has been advised, although no guaranty for success could be given, most patients have improved function and less pain.  All questions were thoroughly answered.  The patient requested surgical repair since the problem has reached a point that interferes with her normal daily activities.  The purpose of the surgery is to alleviate the pain and discomfort.,DETAILS OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in a supine position.  No tourniquet was utilized.  IV sedation was administered and during that time local anesthetic consisting of approximately 10 mL total in a 1:1 mixture of 0.25% Marcaine and 1% lidocaine with epinephrine was locally infiltrated proximal to the operative site.  The lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Balanced anesthesia was obtained.,PROCEDURE #1: , Distal metaphyseal osteotomy with internal screw fixation with bunionectomy, right foot.  A dorsal curvilinear incision medial to the extensor hallucis longus tendon was made, extending from the distal third of the shaft of the first metatarsal to a point midway on the shaft of the proximal phalanx.  Care was taken to identify and retract the vital structures and when necessary, vessels were ligated via electrocautery.  Sharp and blunt dissection was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue, superficial fascia, and then down to the capsular and periosteal layer, which was visualized.  A linear periosteal capsular incision was made in line with the skin incision.  The capsular tissue and periosteal layer were underscored, free from its underlying osseous attachments, and they refracted to expose the osseous surface.  Inspection revealed increased first intermetatarsal angle and hypertrophic changes to the first metatarsal head.  The head of the first metatarsal was dissected free from its attachment medially and dorsally, delivered dorsally and may be into the wound.,Inspection revealed the first metatarsophalangeal joint surface appeared to be in satisfactory condition.  The sesamoid was in satisfactory condition.  An oscillating saw was utilized to resect the hypertrophic portion of the first metatarsal head to remove the normal and functional configuration.  Care was taken to preserve the sagittal groove.  The rough edges were then smoothed with a rasp.,Attention was then focused on the medial mid portion of the first metatarsal head where a K-wire access guide was positioned to define the apex and direction of displacement for the capital fragment.  The access guide was noted to be in good position.  A horizontally placed, through-and-through osteotomy with the apex distal and the base proximal was completed.  The short plantar arm was from the access guide to proximal plantar and the long dorsal arm was from the access guide to proximal dorsal.  The capital fragment was distracted off the first metatarsal, moved laterally to decrease the intermetatarsal angle to create a more anatomical and functional position of the first metatarsal head.  The capital fragment was impacted upon the metatarsal.,Inspection revealed satisfactory reduction of the intermetatarsal angle and good alignment of the capital fragment.  It was then fixated with 1 screw.  A guide pin was directed from the dorsal aspect of the capital fragment to the plantar aspect of the shaft and first metatarsal in a distal dorsal to proximal plantar direction.  The length was measured, __________ mm cannulated cortical screw was placed over the guide pin and secured in position.  Compression and fixation were noted to be satisfactory.  Inspection revealed good fixation and alignment at the operative site.  Attention was then directed to the medial portion of the distal third of the shaft of the first metatarsal where an oscillating saw was used to resect the small portion of the bone that was created by shifting the capital fragment laterally.  All rough edges were rasped smooth.  Examination revealed there was still lateral deviation of the hallux.  A second procedure, the reposition osteotomy of the proximal phalanx with internal screw fixation to correct angulation deformity was indicated., ,PROCEDURE #2:,  Reposition osteotomy with internal screw fixation to correct angulation deformity, proximal phalanx, right hallux.  The original skin incision was extended from the point just distal to the interphalangeal joint.  All vital structures were identified and retracted.  Sharp and blunt dissection was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue, superficial fascia, and down to the periosteal layer, which was underscored, free from its underlying osseous attachments and reflected to expose the osseous surface.  The focus of the deformity was noted to be more distal on the hallux.  Utilizing an oscillating saw, a more distal, wedge-shaped transverse oblique osteotomy was made with the apex being proximal and lateral and the base medial distal was affected.  The proximal phalanx was then placed in appropriate alignment and stabilized with a guide pin, which was then measured, __________ 14 mm cannulated cortical screw was placed over the guide pin and secured into position.,Inspection revealed good fixation and alignment at the osteotomy site.  The alignment and contour of the first way was now satisfactorily improved.  The entire surgical wound was flushed with copious amounts of sterile normal saline irrigation.  The periosteal and capsular layer was closed with running sutures of #3-0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissue was closed with #4-0 Vicryl and the skin edges coapted well with #4-0 nylon with running simples, reinforced with Steri-Strips.,Approximately 6 mL total in a 1:1 mixture of 0.25% Marcaine and 1% lidocaine plain was locally infiltrated proximal to the operative site for postoperative anesthesia.  A dressing consisting of Adaptic and 4 x 4 was applied to the wound making sure the hallux was carefully splinted, followed by confirming bandages and an ACE wrap to provide mild compression.  The patient tolerated the procedure and anesthesia well and left the operating room to recovery room in good postoperative condition with vital signs stable and arterial perfusion intact as evident by the normal capillary fill time.,A walker boot was dispensed and applied.  The patient should wear it when walking or standing., ,The next office visit will be in 4 days.  The patient was given prescriptions for Percocet 5 mg #40 one p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n. pain, along with written and oral home instructions.  The patient was discharged home with vital signs stable in no acute distress.",2.0
4238,"HISTORY: , The patient is a 78-year-old right-handed inpatient with longstanding history of cervical spinal stenosis status post decompression, opioid dependence, who has had longstanding low back pain radiating into the right leg.  She was undergoing a spinal epidural injection about a month ago and had worsening of right low back pain, which radiates down into her buttocks and down to posterior aspect of her thigh into her knee.  This has required large amounts of opioid analgesics to control.  She has been basically bedridden because of this.  She was brought into hospital for further investigations.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , On examination, she has positive straight leg rising on the right with severe shooting, radicular type pain with right leg movement.  Difficult to assess individual muscles, but strength is largely intact.  Sensory examination is symmetric.  Deep tendon reflexes reveal hyporeflexia in both patellae, which probably represents a cervical myelopathy from prior cord compression.  She has slightly decreased right versus left ankle reflexes.  The Babinski's are positive.  On nerve conduction studies, motor and sensory distal latencies, evoked response amplitudes, conduction velocities, and F-waves are normal in lower extremities.,NEEDLE EMG: , Needle EMG was performed on the right leg and lumbosacral paraspinal muscles using a disposable concentric needle.  It reveals the spontaneous activity in right peroneus longus and gastrocnemius medialis muscles as well as the right lower lumbosacral paraspinal muscles.  There is evidence of denervation in right gastrocnemius medialis muscle.,IMPRESSION: , This electrical study is abnormal.  It reveals the following:,1.  Inactive right S1 (L5) radiculopathy.,2.

The patient was admitted and splinted and had compartment checks.  The risks of surgery were discussed in detail including, but not limited to infection, bleeding, injuries to nerves, or vital structures, nonunion or malunion, need for reoperation, compartment syndrome, and the risk of anesthesia.  The patient understood these risks and wished to proceed.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS: , Left tibial shaft fracture status post gunshot wound (CPT code 27759).,POSTOP DIAGNOSIS: , Left tibial shaft fracture status post gunshot wound (CPT code 27759).,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,INTRAVENOUS FLUID:,  900.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  ,100.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,DISPOSITION: , Stable to PACU.,PROCEDURE DETAIL:  ,The patient was met in the preoperative holding area and operative site was marked.  The patient was brought to the operating room and given preoperative antibiotics.  Left leg was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A midline incision was made in the center of the knee and was carried down sharply to the retinacular tissue.  The starting guidewire was used to localize the correct starting point, which is on the medial aspect of the lateral tibial eminence.  This was advanced and confirmed on the AP and lateral fluoroscopic images.  The opening reamer was then used and the ball-tip guidewire was passed.  The reduction was obtained over a large radiolucent triangle.  After passing the guidewire and achieving appropriate reduction, the flexible reamers were then sequentially passed, starting at 9 mm up to 11.5 mm reamer.  At this point, a 10 x 390 mm was passed without difficulty.  The guide was used to the proximal locking screw and the appropriate circle technique was used to the distal locking screws.  The final images were taken with fluoroscopy and a 15-mm end-cap was placed.  The wounds were then irrigated and closed with 2-0 Vicryl followed by staples to the distal screws and 0 Vicryl followed 2-0 Vicryl and staples to the proximal incision.

Cervical facial rhytidectomy with purse-string SMAS elevation with submental lipectomy.,ASSISTANT:  ,None.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal anesthesia.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was placed in a supine position and prepped with general endotracheal anesthesia.  Local infiltration anesthesia with 1% Xylocaine and 1:100,000 epinephrine was infiltrated in upper and lower eyelids.,Markings were made and fusiform ellipse of skin was resected from the upper eyelid.  The lower limb of the fusiform ellipse was at the superior palpebral fold.  A 9 mm of upper eyelid skin was resected at the widest portion of the lips, which extended from medial canthal area to the lateral orbital rim.  This was performed bilaterally and symmetrically and the skin was removed.  Incision was made through the pretarsal orbicularis with small amount of fat being removed from the medial and middle fat pocket.  An incision was made over the superior orbital rim.  Subperiosteal dissection was performed over the forehead.  The dissection proceeded medially.  The corrugator and procerus muscles were carefully dissected from the supratrochlear nerves on both right and left side and cauterized.,Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery in this fashion.  A 4-cm incision was made, and the forehead at the hairline, subcutaneous dissection was performed and extended over the frontalis muscle for approximately 4 cm.  A subperiosteal dissection was performed after the fibers of the frontalis muscle were separated and subperiosteal dissection from the forehead lead the subperiosteal dissection from the upper eyelid.  The incision was made in the lower lid just beneath the lashline.  Subcutaneous dissection was performed over the pretarsal and preseptal muscle.  Dissection was then proceeded down to the inferior orbital rim.  The arcus marginalis was released and the lower eyelid fat was teased over the inferior orbital rim and sutured to the suborbicularis oculi fat and periosteum, which was separated from the inferior orbital rim.  The orbital fat was sutured to the suborbicularis oculi fat with multiple preplaced sutures of 5-0 Vicryl on a P2 needle.  The upper eyelid incision was closed with a running subcuticular 6-0 Prolene suture bilaterally.  The forehead was then elevated, and the nonhairbearing forehead skin was resected 1.5 cm wide raising the tail of the eyebrow.  The head of the eyebrow was felt to be elevated by the antagonistic frontalis muscle now that the accessory muscles specifically the corrugator and procerus and depressor supercilii were released and divided.,A lateral canthopexy was performed with 5-0 Prolene suture on a C1 double-arm tapered needle being passed from the lateral commissure of the eyelid to the small stab incision being passed to the medial superior orbital rim and sutured to tighten the lower lid.  The distal lateral resection of excessive lower eyelid skin was reduced at risk of eyelid malposition.  The lower lid incision was closed after the redundancy of skin measuring approximately 3 mm was resected on both sides.  Closure was performed with interrupted 6-0 silk suture for the lower lid.  The eyebrow hairline brow lift was closed with interrupted 4-0 PDS suture, deep subcutaneous tissue, and dermis, and the skin closed with a running 5-0 Prolene suture.,Attention then was directed to the cervical facial rhytidectomy and purse-string SMAS elevation with submental lipectomy.  Incisions were made in preauricular area, postauricular area, mastoid and occipital area.  Subcutaneous dissection was performed to the nasolabial fold and cheek and extending across the neck in the midline.  Submental lipectomy was performed through the incision in the submental crease.  Fat was directly removed from the fascia.,Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery.  A SMAS elevation was performed with a purse-string suture of 2-0 PDS suture from temporalis fascia in front of the ear extending beneath the mandible and then brought back up to be sutured to the temporalis fascia.  This was performed bilaterally and symmetrically.  Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery.  The cheek flap was brought back posteriorly and the cervical flap posteriorly and superiorly with redundant skin on the right massaged and closed.  The skin of the cheek and neck were resected which was redundant after the ***** posteriorly and superiorly in the neck and transversely in the cheek.,Closure was performed with interrupted 3-0 and 4-0 PDS suture of deep subcutaneous tissue and dermis of the skin was closed with a running 5-0 Prolene suture.  Drains were placed prior to final closure.  A 7-mm flat Jackson-Pratt was then secured with 3-0 silk suture.  Dressing consisting of fluffs and Kerlix and a 4-inch Ace were applied to support mildly compressive dressing.  Scleral eye protectors were removed.  Maxitrol eye ointment was placed followed by Swiss therapy eye pads.

2950,"DATE OF INJURY : October 4, 2000,DATE OF EXAMINATION : September 5, 2003,EXAMINING PHYSICIAN : X Y, MD,Prior to the beginning of the examination, it is explained to the examinee that this examination is intended for evaluative purposes only, and that it is not intended to constitute a general medical examination. It is explained to the examinee that the traditional doctor-patient relationship does not apply to this examination, and that a written report will be provided to the agency requesting this examination. It has also been emphasized to the examinee that he should not attempt any physical activity beyond his tolerance, in order to avoid injury.,CHIEF COMPLAINT:  ,Aching and mid back pain.,HISTORY OF PRESENT INJURY: , Based upon the examinee's perspective: ,Mr. Abc is a 52-year-old self-employed, independent consultant for DEMILEE-USA. He is also a mechanical engineer. He reports that he was injured in a motor vehicle accident that occurred in October 4, 2000. At that time, he was employed as a purchasing agent for IBIKEN-USA. On the date of the motor vehicle accident, he was sitting in the right front passenger's seat, wearing seat and shoulder belt safety harnesses, in his 1996 or 1997 Volvo 850 Wagon automobile driven by his son. The vehicle was completely stopped and was ""slammed from behind"" by a van. The police officer, who responded to the accident, told Mr. Abc that the van was probably traveling at approximately 30 miles per hour at the time of impact.,During the impact, Mr. Abc was restrained in the seat and did not contact the interior surface of the vehicle. He experienced immediate mid back pain. He states that the Volvo automobile sustained approximately $4600 in damage.,He was transported by an ambulance, secured by a cervical collar and backboard to the emergency department. An x-ray of the whole spine was obtained, and he was evaluated by a physician's assistant. He was told that it would be ""okay to walk."" He was prescribed pain pills and told to return for reevaluation if he experienced increasing pain.,He returned to the Kaiser facility a few days later, and physical therapy was prescribed. Mr. Abc states that he was told that ""these things can take a long time."" He indicates that after one year he was no better. He then states that after two years he was no better and worried if the condition would never get better.,He indicates he saw an independent physician, a general practitioner, and an MRI was ordered. The MRI study was completed at ABCD Hospital. Subsequently, Mr. Abc returned and was evaluated by a physiatrist. The physiatrist reexamined the original thoracic spine x-rays that were taken on October 4, 2000, and stated that he did not know why the radiologist did not originally observe vertebral compression fractures. Mr. Abc believes that he was told by the physiatrist that it involved either T6-T7 or T7-T8.,Mr. Abc reports that the physiatrist told him that little could be done besides participation in core strengthening. Mr. Abc describes his current exercise regimen, consisting of cycling, and it was deemed to be adequate. He was told, however, by the physiatrist that he could also try a Pilates type of core exercise program.,The physiatrist ordered a bone scan, and Mr. Abc is unsure of the results. He does not have a formal follow up scheduled with Kaiser, and is awaiting re-contact by the physiatrist.,He denies any previous history of symptomatology or injuries involving his back.,CURRENT SYMPTOMS:  ,He reports that he has the same mid back pain that has been present since the original injury. It is located in the same area, the mid thoracic spine area. It is described as a pain and an ache and ranges from 3/10 to 6/10 in intensity, and the intensity varies, seeming to go in cycles. The pain has been staying constant.,When I asked whether or not the pain have improved, he stated that he was unable to determine whether or not he had experienced improvement. He indicates that there may be less pain, or conversely, that he may have developed more of a tolerance for the pain. He further states that ""I can power through it."" ""I have learned how to manage the pain, using exercise, stretching, and diversion techniques."" It is primary limitation with regards to the back pain involves prolonged sitting. After approximately two hours of sitting, he has required to get up and move around, which results in diminishment of the pain. He indicates that prior to the motor vehicle accident, he could sit for significantly longer periods of time, 10 to 12 hours on a regular basis, and up to 20 hours, continuously, on an occasional basis.,He has never experienced radiation of the pain from the mid thoracic spine, and he has never experienced radicular symptoms of radiation of pain into the extremities, numbness, tingling, or weakness.,Again, aggravating activities include prolonged sitting, greater than approximately two hours.,Alleviating activities include moving around, stretching, and exercising. Also, if he takes ibuprofen, it does seem to help with the back pain.,He is not currently taking medications regularly, but list that he takes occasional ibuprofen when the pain is too persistent.,He indicates that he received several physical therapy sessions for treatment, and was instructed in stretching and exercises. He has subsequently performed the prescribed stretching and exercises daily, for nearly three years.,With regards to recreational activities, he states that he has not limited his activities due to his back pain.,He denies bowel or bladder dysfunction.,FILES REVIEW:  ,October 4, 2000: An ambulance was dispatched to the scene of a motor vehicle accident on South and Partlow Road. The EMS crew arrived to find a 49-year-old male sitting in the front passenger seat of a vehicle that was damaged in a rear-end collision and appeared to have minimal damage. He was wearing a seatbelt and he denied loss of consciousness. He also denied a pertinent past medical history. They noted pain in the lower cervical area, mid thoracic and lumbar area. They placed him on a backboard and transported him to Medical Center.,October 4, 2000: He was seen in the emergency department of Medical Center. The provider is described as ""unknown."" The history from the patient was that he was the passenger in the front seat of a car that was stopped and rear-ended. He stated that he did not exit the car because of pain in his upper back. He reported he had been wearing the seatbelt and harness at that time. He denied a history of back or neck injuries. He was examined on a board and had a cervical collar in place. He was complaining of mid back pain. He denied extremity weakness. Sensory examination was intact. There was no tenderness with palpation or flexion in the neck. The back was a little tender in the upper thoracic spine area without visible deformity. There were no marks on the back. His x-ray was described as ""no acute bony process."" Listed visit diagnosis was a sprain-thoracic, and he was prescribed hydrocodone/acetaminophen tablets and Motrin 800 mg tablets.,October 4, 2000: During the visit, a Clinician's Report of Disability document was signed by Dr. M, authorizing time loss from October 4, 2000, through October 8, 2000. The document also advised no heavy lifting, pushing, pulling, or overhead work for two weeks. During this visit, a thoracic spine x-ray series, two views, was obtained and read by Dr. JR. The findings demonstrate no evidence of acute injury. No notable arthritic findings. The pedicles and paravertebral soft tissues appear unremarkable.,November 21, 2000: An outpatient progress note was completed at Kaiser, and the clinician of record was Dr. H. The history obtained documents that Mr. Abc continued to experience the same pain that he first noted after the accident, described as a discomfort in the mid thoracic spine area. It was non-radiating and described as a tightness. He also reported that he was hearing clicking noises that he had not previously heard. He denied loss of strength in the arms. The physical examination revealed good strength and normal deep tendon reflexes in the arms. There was minimal tenderness over T4 through T8, in an approximate area. The visit diagnosis listed was back pain. Also described in the assessment was residual pain from MVA, suspected bruised muscles. He was prescribed Motrin 800 mg tablets and an order was sent to physical therapy. Dr. N also documents that if the prescribed treatment measures were not effective, then he would suggest a referral to a physiatrist. Also, the doctor wanted him to discuss with physical therapy whether or not they thought that a chiropractor would be beneficial.,December 4, 2000: He was seen at Kaiser for a physical therapy visit by Philippe Justel, physical therapist. The history obtained from Mr. Abc is that he was not improving. Symptoms described were located in the mid back, centrally. The examination revealed mild tenderness, centrally at T3-T8, with very poor segmental mobility. The posture was described as rigid T/S in flexion. Range of motion was described as within normal limits, without pain at the cervical spine and thoracic spine. The plan listed included two visits per week for two weeks, for mobilization. It is also noted that the physical therapist would contact the MD regarding a referral to a chiropractor.,December 8, 2000: He was seen at Kaiser for a physical therapy visit by Mr. Justel. It was noted that the subjective category of the document revealed that there was no real change. It was noted that Mr. Abc tolerated the treatment well and that he was to see a chiropractor on Monday.,December 11, 2000: He presented to the Chiropractic Wellness Center. There is a form titled 'Chiropractic Case History,' and it documents that Mr. Abc was involved in a motor vehicle accident, in which he was rear-ended in October. He has had mid back pain since that time. The pain is worsened with sitting, especially at a computer. The pain decreases when he changes positions, and sometimes when he walks. Mr. Abc reports that he occasionally takes 800 mg doses of ibuprofen. He reported he went to physical therapy treatment on two occasions, which helped for a few hours only. He did report that he had a previous history of transitory low back pain.,During the visit, he completed a modified Oswestry Disability Questionnaire, and a WC/PI Subjective Complaint Form. He listed complaints of mid and low back pain of a sore and aching character. He rated the pain at grade 3-5/10, in intensity. He reported difficulty with sitting at a table, bending forward, or stooping. He reported that the pain was moderate and comes and goes.,During the visit at the Chiropractic Wellness Center, a spinal examination form was completed. It documents palpation tenderness in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine area and also palpation tenderness present in the suboccipital area, scalenes, and trapezia. Active cervical range of motion measured with goniometry reveals pain and restriction in all planes. Active thoracic range of motion measured with inclinometry revealed pain and restriction in rotation bilaterally. Active lumbosacral range of motion measured with inclinometry reveals pain with lumbar extension, right lateral flexion, and left lateral flexion.,December 11, 2000: He received chiropractic manipulation treatment, and he was advised to return for further treatment at a frequency of twice a week.,December 13, 2000: He returned to the Chiropractic Wellness Center to see Joe Smith, DC, and it is documented that his middle back was better.,December 13, 2000: A personal injury patient history form is completed at the Chiropractic Wellness Center. Mr. Abc reported that on October 4, 2000, he was driving his 1996 Volvo 850 vehicle, wearing seat and shoulder belt safety harnesses, and completely stopped. He was rear-ended by a vehicle traveling at approximately 30 miles per hour. The impact threw him back into his seat, and he felt back pain and determined that it was not wise to move about. He reported approximate damage to his vehicle of $4800. He reported continuing mid and low back pain, of a dull and semi-intense nature. He reported that he was an export company manager for IBIKEN-USA, and that he missed two full days of work, and missed 10-plus partial days of work. He stated that he was treated initially after the motor vehicle accident at Kaiser and received painkillers and ibuprofen, which relieved the pain temporarily. He specifically denied ever experiencing similar symptoms.,December 26, 2000: A no-show was documented at the Chiropractic Wellness Center.,April 5, 2001: He received treatment at the Chiropractic Wellness Center. He reported that two weeks previously, his mid back pain had worsened.,April 12, 2001: He received chiropractic treatment at the Chiropractic Wellness Center.,April 16, 2001: He did not show up for his chiropractic treatment.,April 19, 2001: He did not show up for his chiropractic treatment.,April 26, 2001: He received chiropractic manipulation treatment at the Chiropractic Wellness Center. He reported that his mid back pain increased with sitting at the computer. At the conclusion of this visit, he was advised to return to the clinic as needed.,September 6, 2002: An MRI of the thoracic spine was completed at ABCD Hospital and read by Dr. RL, radiologist. Dr. D noted the presence of minor anterior compression of some mid thoracic vertebrae of indeterminate age, resulting in some increased kyphosis. Some of the mid thoracic discs demonstrate findings consistent with degenerative disc disease, without a significant posterior disc bulging or disc herniation. There are some vertebral end-plate abnormalities, consistent with small Schmorl's nodes, one on the superior aspect of T7, which is compressed anteriorly, and on the inferior aspect of T6.,May 12, 2003: He was seen at the Outpatient Clinic by Dr. L, internal medicine specialist. He was there for a health screening examination, and listed that his only complaints are for psoriasis and chronic mid back pain, which have been present since a 2000 motor vehicle accident. Mr. Abc reported that an outside MRI showed compression fractures in the thoracic spine. The history further documents that Mr. Abc is an avid skier and volunteers on the ski patrol. The physical examination revealed that he was a middle-aged Caucasian male in no acute distress. The diagnosis listed from this visit is back pain and psoriasis. Dr. L documented that he spent one hour in the examination room with the patient discussing what was realistic and reasonable with regard to screening testing. Dr. L also stated that since Mr. Abc was experiencing chronic back pain, he advised him to see a physiatrist for evaluation. He was instructed to bring the MRI to the visit with that practitioner.,June 10, 2003: He was seen at the Physiatry Clinic by Dr. R, physiatrist. The complaint listed is mid back pain. In the subjective portion of the chart note, Dr. R notes that Mr. Abc is involved in the import/export business, and that he is physically active in cycling, skiing, and gardening. He is referred by Dr. L because of persistent lower thoracic pain, following a motor vehicle accident, on October 4, 2000. Mr. Abc told Dr. R that he was the restrained passenger of a vehicle that was rear-ended at a moderate speed. He stated that he experienced immediate discomfort in his thoracic spine area without radiation. He further stated that thoracic spine x-rays were obtained at the Sunnyside Emergency Room and read as normal. It is noted that Mr. Abc was treated conservatively and then referred to physical therapy where he had a number of visits in late of 2002 and early 2003. No further chart entries were documented about the back problem until Mr. Abc complained to Dr. L that he still had ongoing thoracic spine pain during a visit the previous month. He obtained an MRI, out of pocket, at ABCD Hospital and stated that he paid $1100 for it. Dr. R asked to see the MRI and was told by Mr. Abc that he would have to reimburse or pay him $1100 first. He then told the doctor that the interpretation was that he had a T7 and T8 compression fracture. Mr. Abc reported his improvement at about 20%, compared to how he felt immediately after the accident. He described that his only symptoms are an aching pain that occurs after sitting for four to five hours. If he takes a break from sitting and walks around, his symptoms resolve. He is noted to be able to bike, ski, and be active in his garden without any symptoms at all. He denied upper extremity radicular symptoms. He denied lower extremity weakness or discoordination. He also denied bowel or bladder control or sensation issues. Dr. R noted that Mr. Abc was hostile about the Kaiser health plan and was quite uncommunicative, only reluctantly revealing his history. The physical examination revealed that he moved about the examination room without difficulty and exhibited normal lumbosacral range of motion. There was normal thoracic spine motion with good chest expansion. Neurovascular examination of the upper extremities was recorded as normal. There was no spasticity in the lower extremities. There was no tenderness to palpation or percussion up and down the thoracic spine. Dr. R reviewed the thoracic spine films and noted the presence of ""a little compression of what appears to be T7 and T8 on the lateral view."" Dr. R observed that this was not noted on the original x-ray interpretation. He further stated that the MRI, as noted above, was not available for review. Dr. R assessed that Mr. Abc was experiencing minimal thoracic spine complaints that probably related to the motor vehicle accident three years previously. The doctor further stated that ""the patient's symptoms are so mild as to almost not warrant intervention."" He discussed the need to make sure that Mr. Abc's workstation was ergonomic and that Mr. Abc could pursue core strengthening. He further recommended that Mr. Abc look into participation in a Pilates class. Mr. Abc was insistent, so Dr. R made plans to order a bone scan to further discriminate the etiology of his symptoms. He advised Mr. Abc that the bone scan results would probably not change treatment. As a result of this visit, Dr. R diagnosed thoracic spine pain (724.1) and ordered a bone scan study.",1.0

He was seen for consideration of a MUD transplant, but was deemed not to be a candidate because of the social support as well as his reasonably good health.,At our institution, the patient received a trial of lenalidomide and prednisone for a short period.  He did well with the combination.  Subsequently, he developed intolerance to lenalidomide.  He complained of severe fatigue and diarrhea.  This was subsequently stopped.,The patient reports some injury to his left leg last week.  His left leg apparently was swollen.  He took steroids for about 3 days and stopped.  Left leg swelling has disappeared.  The patient denies any other complaints at this point in time.  He admits to smoking marijuana.  He says this gives him a great appetite and he has actually gained some weight.  Performance status in the ECOG scale is 1.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS:  He is afebrile.  Blood pressure 144/85, pulse 86, weight 61.8 kg, and respiratory rate 18 per minute.  GENERAL:  He is in no acute distress.  HEENT:  There is no pallor, icterus or cervical adenopathy that is noted.  Oral cavity is normal to exam.  CHEST:  Clear to auscultation.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  S1 and S2 normal with regular rate and rhythm.  ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender with no hepatomegaly.  Spleen is palpable 4 fingerbreadths below the left costal margin.  There is no guarding, tenderness, rebound or rigidity noted.  Bowel sounds are present.  EXTREMITIES:  Reveal no edema.  Palpation of the left tibia revealed some mild tenderness.  However, I do not palpate any bony abnormalities.  There is no history of deep venous thrombosis.,LABORATORY DATA: , CBC from today is significant for a white count of 41,900 with an absolute neutrophil count of 34,400, hemoglobin 14.8 with an MCV of 56.7, and platelet count 235,000.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:,1.  JAK-2 positive myeloproliferative disorder.  The patient has failed pretty much all available options.  He is not a candidate for chlorambucil or radioactive phosphorus because of his young age and the concern for secondary malignancy.  I have e-mailed Dr. X to see whether he will be a candidate for the LBH trial.  Hopefully, we can get a JAK-2 inhibitor trial quickly on board.,2.  I am concerned about the risk of thrombosis with his elevated white count.  He is on aspirin prophylaxis.  The patient has been told to call me with any complaints.,3.  Left shin pain.  I have ordered x-rays of the left tibia and knee today.  The patient will return to the clinic in 3 weeks.  He is to call me in the interim for any problems.",1.0

The patient received 1 gm of IV Ancef intravenously piggyback.  The abdomen was prepared and draped in routine sterile fashion.,A 1-cm incision was made at the umbilicus and a Veress needle was inserted.  Saline test was performed.  Satisfactory pneumoperitoneum was achieved by insufflation of CO2 to a pressure of 14 mmHg.  The Veress needle was removed.  A 10- to 11-mm cannula was inserted.  Inspection of the peritoneal cavity revealed a gallbladder that was soft and without adhesions to it.  It was largely mobile.  The liver had a normal appearance as did the peritoneal cavity.  A 5-mm cannula was inserted in the right upper quadrant anterior axillary line.  A second 5-mm cannula was inserted in the subcostal space.  A 10- to 11-mm cannula was inserted into the upper midline.,The gallbladder was reflected in a cephalad direction.  The gallbladder was punctured with the aspirating needle, and under C-arm fluoroscopy was filled with contrast, filling the intra- and extrahepatic biliary trees, which appeared normal.  Extra contrast was aspirated and the aspirating needle was removed.  The ampulla was grasped with a second grasper, opening the triangle of Calot.  The cystic duct was dissected and exposed at its junction with the ampulla, was controlled with a hemoclip, digitally controlled with two clips and divided.  This was done while the common duct was in full visualization.  The cystic artery was similarly controlled and divided.  The gallbladder was dissected from its bed and separated from the liver, brought to the outside through the upper midline cannula and removed.,The subhepatic and subphrenic spaces were irrigated thoroughly with saline solution.  There was oozing and bleeding from the lateral 5-mm cannula site, but this stopped spontaneously with removal of the cannula.

The large and small bowels were completely enveloping a large right ovarian cystic mass.  Normal anatomy was difficult to see due to adhesions.  Cyst was ruptured incidentally intraoperatively with approximately 150 mL to 200 mL of turbid fluid.  Cyst wall, tube, and ovary were stripped away from the bowel.  Posterior peritoneum was also removed in order to completely remove the cyst wall ovary and tube.  There was excellent postoperative hemostasis.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room, where general anesthesia was achieved without difficulty.  She was then placed in a dorsal supine position and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A vertical midline incision was made from the umbilicus and extended to the symphysis pubis along the line of the patient's prior incision.  Incision was carried down carefully until the peritoneal cavity was reached.  Care was taken upon entry of the peritoneum to avoid injury of underlying structures.  At this point, the extensive adhesive disease was noted, again requiring greater than 45 minutes of dissection in order to visualize the intended anatomy for surgery.  The omentum was carefully stripped away from the patient's right side developing a window.  This was extended down along the inferior portion of the incision removing the omentum from its adhesions to the anterior peritoneum and what appears to be the vesicouterine peritoneum.  A large mass of bowel was noted to be adherent to itself causing a quite tortuous course.  Adhesiolysis was performed in order to free up the bowel in order to pack it out of the pelvis.  Excellent hemostasis was noted.  The bowel was then packed over of the pelvis allowing visualization of a matted mass of large and small bowel surrounding a large ovarian cyst.  Careful adhesive lysis and dissection enabled the colon to be separated from the posterior wall of the cyst.  Small bowel and portion of the colon were adherent anteriorly on the cyst and during the dissection of these to remove them from their attachment, the cyst was ruptured.  Large amount of turbid fluid was noted and was evacuated.  The cyst wall was then carefully placed under tension and stripped away from the patient's small and large bowel.  Once the bowel was freed, the remnants of round ligament was identified, elevated, and the peritoneum was incised opening the retroperitoneal space.,The retroperitoneal space was opened following the line of the ovarian vessels, which were identified and elevated and a window made inferior to the ovarian vessels, but superior to the course of the ureter.  This pedicle was doubly clamped, transected, and tied with a free tie of #2-0 Vicryl.  A suture ligature of #0 Vicryl was used to obtain hemostasis.  Excellent hemostasis was noted at this pedicle.  The posterior peritoneum and portion of the remaining broad ligament were carefully dissected and shelled out to remove the tube and ovary, which was still densely adherent to the peritoneum.  Care was taken at the side of the remnant of the uterine vessels.  However, a laceration of the uterine vessels did occur, which was clamped with a right-angle clamp, and carefully sutured ligated with excellent hemostasis noted.  Remainder of the specimen was then shelled out including portions of the posterior and sidewall peritoneum and removed.,The opposite tube and ovary were identified, were also matted behind a large amount of large bowel and completely enveloped and wrapped in the fallopian tube.  Minimal dissection was performed in order to ascertain and ensure that the ovary appeared completely normal.  It was then left in situ.  Hemostasis was achieved in the pelvis with the use of electrocautery.  The abdomen and pelvis were copiously irrigated with warm saline solution.  The peritoneal edges were inspected and found to have good hemostasis after the side of the uterine artery pedicle, and the ovarian vessel pedicle.  The areas of the bowel had previously been dissected and due to adhesive disease, it was carefully inspected and excellent hemostasis was noted.,All instruments and packs removed from the patient's abdomen.  The abdomen was closed with a running mattress closure of #0 PDS, beginning at the superior aspect of the incision, and extending inferiorly.  Excellent closure of the incision was noted.  The subcutaneous tissues were then copiously irrigated.  Hemostasis was achieved with the use of cautery.  Subcutaneous tissues were reapproximated to close the edge space with a several interrupted sutures of #0 plain gut suture.  The skin was closed with staples.,Incision was sterilely clean and dressed.  The patient was awakened from general anesthesia and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.

There might have been a small CSF leak with Valsalva, so the recommendation was for a reconstruction, Dr. X will dictate.  The fat graft was harvested from the left lower quadrant and closed primarily, this was soaked in fat and used to close the closure.  All sponge and needle counts were correct.  The patient was extubated and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.  Blood loss was minimal.",1.0

Transthoracic echocardiogram showed mild mitral regurgitation, mild tricuspid regurgitation and a left to right shunt. There was no evidence of blood clot.,Hospital course: 5 days after admission the patient began to complain of proximal LLE and left flank pain. On exam, she had weakness of the quadriceps and hip flexors of the LLE. Her pain increased with left hip flexion. In addition, she complained of paresthesias about the lateral aspect of the medial anterior left thigh; and upon on sensory testing, she had decreased PP/TEMP sensation in a left femoral nerve distribution. She denied any back/neck pain and the rest of her neurologic exam remained unchanged from admission.,Abdominal CT Scan, 2/4/96, revealed a large left retroperitoneal iliopsoas hematoma.,Hgb 8.9g/dl.

She was discharged home on ASA.,At follow-up, on 2/23/96, she complained of left sided paresthesias (worse in the LLE than in the LUE) and feeling of ""swollen left foot."" These symptoms had developed approximately 1 month after her stroke. Her foot looked normal and her UE strength was 5/4+ proximally and distally, and LE strength 5/4+ proximally and 5/5- distally. She was ambulatory. There was no evidence of LUE upward drift. A somatosensory evoked potential study revealed an absent N20 and normal P14 potentials. This was suggestive of a lesion involving the right thalamus which might explain her paresthesia/dysesthesia as part of a Dejerine-Roussy syndrome.",1.0

A curvilinear incision was made below the umbilicus.  Through this incision, the camera port was able to be placed into the peritoneal cavity under direct visualization.  Once this complete, insufflation was begun.  Once insufflation was adequate, additional ports were placed in the epigastrium as well as right upper quadrant.  Once all four ports were placed, the right upper quadrant was then explored.  The patient had significant adhesions of omentum and colon to the liver, the gallbladder constituting definitely an acute cholecystitis.  This was taken down using Bovie cautery to free up visualization of the gallbladder.  The gallbladder was very thick and edematous and had frank necrosis of most of the anterior gallbladder wall.  Adhesions were further taken down between the omentum, the colon, and the gallbladder slowly starting superiorly and working inferiorly towards the cystic duct area.  Once the adhesions were fully removed, the cholangiogram was done which did not show any evidence of any common bile duct dilatation or obstruction.  At this point, due to the patient's gallbladder being very necrotic, it was deemed that the patient should have a drain placed.  The cystic duct and cystic artery were serially clipped and transected.  The gallbladder was removed from the gallbladder fossa removing the entire gallbladder.  Adequate hemostasis with Bovie cautery was achieved.  The gallbladder was then placed into a bag and removed from the peritoneal cavity through the camera port.  A JP drain was then run through the anterior port and out of one of the trochar sites and secured to the skin using 3-0 nylon suture.  Next, the right upper quadrant was copiously irrigated out using the suction irrigator.  Once this was complete, the additional ports were able to be removed.  The fascial opening at the umbilicus was reinforced by closing it using a 0 Vicryl suture in a figure-of-8 fashion.  All skin incisions were injected using Marcaine 1/4 percent plain.  The skin was reapproximated further using 4-0 Monocryl sutures in a subcuticular technique.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was able to be transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.",2.0

She noticed a lump in the breast in November of 2007.  A mammogram was obtained dated 01/28/08, which showed a mass in the right breast.  On 02/10/08, she underwent an ultrasound-guided biopsy.  The pathology showed an infiltrating ductal carcinoma Nottingham grade II.  The tumor was ER positive, PR positive and HER-2/neu negative.  On 02/22/08, she underwent a lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy.  The pathology showed a 3.3 cm infiltrating ductal carcinoma grade I, one sentinel lymph node was negative.  Therefore it was a T2, N0, M0 stage IIA breast cancer.  Of note, at that time she was taking hormone replacement therapy and that was stopped.  She underwent radiation treatment ending in May 2008.  She then started on Arimidex, but unfortunately she did not tolerate the Arimidex and I changed her to Femara.  She also did not tolerate the Femara and I changed it to tamoxifen.  She did not tolerate the tamoxifen and therefore when I saw her on 11/23/09, she decided that she would take no further antiestrogen therapy.

Sponge, needle, and instrument counts were correct per OR staff.,HISTORY:,  This is a 57-year-old female who was found to have a large left adrenal mass, approximately 5.5 cm in size.  She had undergone workup previously with my associate, Dr. X as well as by Endocrinology, and showed this to be a nonfunctioning mass.  Due to the size, the patient was advised to undergo an adrenalectomy and she chose the laparoscopic approach due to her multiple pulmonary comorbidities.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , Showed multiple intraabdominal adhesions in the anterior abdominal wall.  The spleen and liver were unremarkable.  The gallbladder was surgically absent.,There was large amount of omentum and bowel in the pelvis, therefore the gynecological organs were not visualized.  There was no evidence of peritoneal studding or masses.  The stomach was well decompressed as well as the bladder.,PROCEDURE DETAILS: , After informed consent was obtained from the patient, she was taken to the operating room and given general anesthesia.  She was placed on a bean bag and secured to the table.  The table was rotated to the right to allow gravity to aid in our retraction of the bowel.,Prep was performed.  Sterile drapes were applied.  Using the Hassan technique, we placed a primary laparoscopy port approximately 3 cm lateral to the umbilicus on the left.  Laparoscopy was performed with ___________.  At this point, we had a second trocar, which was 10 mm to 11 mm port.  Using the non-cutting trocar in the anterior axillary line and using Harmonic scalpel, we did massive lysis of adhesions from the anterior abdominal wall from the length of the prior abdominal incision, the entire length of the abdominal incision from the xiphoid process to the umbilicus.  The adhesions were taken down off the entire anterior abdominal wall.,At this point, secondary and tertiary ports were placed.  We had one near the midline in the subcostal region and to the left midline and one at the midclavicular line, which were also 10 and 11 ports using a non-cutting blade.,At this point, using the Harmonic scalpel, we opened the white line of Toldt on the left and reflected the colon medially, off the anterior aspect of the Gerota's fascia.  Blunt and sharp dissection was used to isolate the upper pole of the kidney, taking down some adhesions from the spleen.  The colon was further mobilized medially again using gravity to aid in our retraction.  After isolating the upper pole of the kidney using blunt and sharp dissection as well as the Harmonic scalpel, we were able to dissect the plane between the upper pole of the kidney and lower aspect of the adrenal gland.  We were able to isolate the adrenal vein, dumping into the renal vein, this was doubly clipped and transected.  There was also noted to be vascular structure of the upper pole, which was also doubly clipped and transected.  Using the Harmonic scalpel, we were able to continue free the remainder of the adrenal glands from its attachments medially, posteriorly, cephalad, and laterally.,At this point, using the EndoCatch bag, we removed the adrenal gland through the primary port in the periumbilical region and sent the flap for analysis.  Repeat laparoscopy showed no additional findings.  The bowel was unremarkable, no evidence of bowel injury, no evidence of any bleeding from the operative site.,The operative site was irrigated copiously with saline and reinspected and again there was no evidence of bleeding.  The abdominal cavity was desufflated and was reinspected.  There was no evidence of bleeding.,At this point, the camera was switched to one of the subcostal ports and the primary port in the periumbilical region was closed under direct vision using #0 Vicryl suture.  At this point, each of the other ports were removed and then with palpation of each of these ports, this indicated that the non-cutting ports did close and there was no evidence of fascial defects.,At this point, the procedure was terminated.  The abdominal cavity was desufflated as stated.  The patient was sent to Recovery in stable condition.  Postoperative orders were written.  The procedure was discussed with the patient's family at length.",2.0

The Veress needle was withdrawn.  A trocar sleeve was placed through the incision into the abdominal cavity.  The trocar was withdrawn and replaced with the laparoscope.  A 1 cm suprapubic skin incision was made.  Through this a second trocar sleeve was placed into the abdominal cavity using direct observation with the laparoscope.  The trocar was withdrawn and replaced with a probe.,The patient was placed in Trendelenburg position, and the bowel was pushed out of the pelvis.  Upon visualization of the pelvis organs, the uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries were all normal.  The probe was withdrawn and replaced with the bipolar cautery instrument.  The right fallopian tube was grasped approximately 1 cm distal to the cornual region of the uterus.  Electrical current was applied to the tube at this point and fulgurated.  The tube was then regrasped just distal to this and refulgurated.  It was then regrasped just distal to the lateral point and refulgurated again.  The same procedure was then carried out on the opposite tube.  The bipolar cautery instrument was withdrawn and replaced with the probe.  The fallopian tubes were again traced to their fimbriated ends to confirm the burn points on the tubes.  The upper abdomen was visualized, and the liver surface was normal.  The gas was allowed to escape from the abdomen, and the instruments were removed.  The skin incisions were repaired.  The instruments were removed from the vagina.,There were no complications to the procedure.  Blood loss was minimal.  The patient went to the postanesthesia recovery room in stable condition.",2.0

1978,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION:,  Renal failure evaluation for possible dialysis therapy.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  This is a 47-year-old gentleman, who works offshore as a cook, who about 4 days ago noted that he was having some swelling in his ankles and it progressively got worse over the past 3 to 4 days, until he was swelling all the way up to his mid thigh bilaterally.  He also felt like he could not make much urine, and his wife, who is a nurse instructed him to force fluids.  While he was there, he was drinking cranberry juice, some Powerade, but he also has a history of weightlifting and had been taking on a creatine protein drink on a daily basis for some time now.  He presented here with very decreased urine output until a Foley catheter was placed and about 500 mL was noted in his bladder.  He did have a CPK level of about 234 while his BUN and creatinine on admission were 109 and 6.9.  Despite IV hydration fluids, his potassium has gone up from 5.4 to 6.1.  He did not put out any significant urine and his weight was documented at 103 kg.  He was given a dose of Kayexalate.  His potassium came down to like about 5.9 and urine studies were ordered.  His urinalysis did show that he had microscopic hematuria and proteinuria and his protein-creatinine ratio was about 9 gm of protein consistent with nephrotic range proteinuria.  He did have a low albumin of 1.9.  He denied any nonsteroidal usage, any recreational drug abuse, and his urine drug screen was unremarkable, and he denied any history of hypertension or any other medical problems.  He has not had any blood work except for drug screens that are required by work and no work up by any primary care physician because he has not seen one for primary care.  He is very concerned because his mother and father were both on dialysis, which he thinks were due to diabetes and both parents have expired.  He denied any hemoptysis, gross hematuria, melena, hematochezia, hemoptysis, hematemesis, no seizures, no palpitations, no pruritus, no chest pain.  He did have a decrease in his appetite, which all started about Thursday.  We were asked to see this patient in consultation by Dr. X because of his renal failure and the need for possible dialysis therapy.  He was significantly hypertensive on admission with a blood pressure of 162/80.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Unremarkable.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: , Unremarkable.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Both mother and father were on dialysis of end-stage renal disease.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , He is married.  He does smoke despite understanding the risks associated with smoking a pack every 6 days.  Does not drink alcohol or use any recreational drug use.  He was on no prescribed medications.  He did have a fairly normal PSA of about 119 and I had ordered a renal ultrasound which showed fairly normal-sized kidneys and no evidence of hydronephrosis or mass, but it was consistent with increased echogenicity in the cortex, findings representative of medical renal disease.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,Vital signs:  Blood pressure is 153/77, pulse 66, respiration 18, temperature 98.5.,General:  He was alert and oriented x 3, in no apparent distress, well-developed male.,HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  Extraocular muscles intact.,Neck:  Supple.  No JVD, adenopathy, or bruit.,Chest:  Clear to auscultation.,Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm without a rub.,Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.,Extremities:  Showed no clubbing, cyanosis.  He did have 2+ pretibial edema in both lower extremities.,Neurologic:  No gross focal findings.,Skin:  Showed no active skin lesions.,LABORATORY DATA: , Sodium 138, potassium 6.1, chloride 108, CO2 22, glucose 116, BUN 111, creatinine 7.29, estimated GFR 10 mL/minute.  Calcium 7.4 with an albumin of 1.9.  Mag normal at 2.2.  Urine culture negative at 12 hours.  His Random urine sodium was low at 12.  Random urine protein was 4756, and creatinine in the urine was 538.  Urine drug screen was unremarkable.  Troponin was within normal limits.  Phosphorus slightly elevated at 5.7.  CPK level was 234, white blood cells 6.5, hemoglobin 12.2, platelet count 188,000 with 75% segs.  PT 10.0, INR 1.0, PTT at 27.3.  B-natriuretic peptide 718.  Urinalysis showed 3+ protein, 4+ blood, negative nitrites, and trace leukocytes, 5 to 10 wbc's, greater than 100 rbc's, occasional fine granular casts, and moderate transitional cells.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Acute kidney injury of which etiology is unknown at this time, with progressive azotemia unresponsive to IV fluids.,2.  Hyperkalemia due to renal failure, slowly improving with Kayexalate.,3.  Microscopic hematuria with nephrotic range proteinuria, more consistent with a glomerulonephropathy nephritis.,4.  Hypertension.,PLAN: , I will give him Kayexalate 15 gm p.o. q.6h. x 2 more doses since he is responding and his potassium is already down to 5.2.  I will also recheck a urinalysis, consult the surgeon in the morning for temporary hemodialysis catheter placement, and consult case managers to start work on a transfer to ABCD Center per the patient and his wife's request, which will occur after his second dialysis treatment if he remains stable.  We will get a BMP, phosphorus, mag, CBC in the morning since he was given 80 mg of Lasix for fluid retention.  We will also give him 10 mg of Zaroxolyn p.o.  Discontinue all IV fluids.  Check an ANCA hepatitis profile, C3 and C4 complement levels along with CH 50 level.  I did discuss with the patient and his wife the need for kidney biopsy and they would like the kidney biopsy to be performed closer to home at Ochsner where his family is, since he only showed up here because of the nearest hospital located to his offshore job.  I do agree with getting him transferred once he is stable from his hyperkalemia and he starts his dialysis.,I appreciate consult.  I did discuss with him the importance of the kidney biopsies to direct treatment, finding the underlying etiology of his acute renal failure and to also give him prognostic factors of renal recovery.",1.0
551,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Bilateral hydroceles.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Bilateral hydroceles.,PROCEDURE: , Bilateral scrotal hydrocelectomies, large for both, and 0.5% Marcaine wound instillation, 30 mL given.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Less than 10 mL.,FLUIDS RECEIVED: , 800 mL.,TUBES AND DRAINS: , A 0.25-inch Penrose drains x4.,INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION:  ,The patient is a 17-year-old boy, who has had fairly large hydroceles noted for some time.  Finally, he has decided to have them get repaired.  Plan is for surgical repair.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified.  Once he was anesthetized, he was then shaved, prepped, and then sterilely prepped and draped.  IV antibiotics were given.  Ancef 1 g given.  A scrotal incision was then made in the right hemiscrotum with a 15-blade knife and further extended with electrocautery.  Electrocautery was used for hemostasis.  Once we got to the hydrocele sac itself, we then opened and delivered the testis, drained clear fluid.  There was moderate amount of scarring on the testis itself from the tunica vaginalis.  It was then wrapped around the back and sutured in place with a running suture of 4-0 chromic in a Lord maneuver.  Once this was done, a drain was placed in the base of the scrotum and then the testis was placed back into the scrotum in the proper orientation.  A similar procedure was performed on the left, which has also had a hydrocele of the cord, which were both addressed and closed with Lord maneuver similarly.  This testis also was normal but had moderate amount of scarring on the tunic vaginalis from this.  A similar drain was placed.  The testes were then placed back into the scrotum in a proper orientation, and the local wound instillation and wound block was then placed using 30 mL of 0.5% Marcaine without epinephrine.  IV Toradol was given at the end of the procedure.  The skin was then sutured with a running interlocking suture of 3-0 Vicryl and the drains were sutured to place with 3-0 Vicryl.  Bacitracin dressing, ABD dressing, and jock strap were placed.  The patient was in stable condition upon transfer to the recovery room.",2.0
3481,"CONSULT REQUEST FOR:, Medical management.,The patient has been in special procedures now for over 2 hours and I am unable to examine.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:, Obtained from Dr. A on an 81-year-old white female, who is right handed, who by history, had a large stroke to the right brain, causing left body findings, last night. She was unfortunately outside of the window for emergent treatment and had a negative CT scan of the head. Was started on protocol medication and that is similar to TPA, which is an investigational study.,During the evaluation she was found to be in atrial fibrillation on admission with hypertension that was treated with labetalol en route. Her heart rate was 130. She was brought down with Cardizem. She received the study drug in the night and about an hour later thought to have another large stroke effecting the opposite side of the brain, that the doctors and company think is probably cardioembolic and not related to the study drug, as TPA has no obvious known association with this.,At that time the patient became comatose and required emergent intubation and paralyzation. Her diastolic at that time rose up to 190, likely the result of the acute second stroke. She is currently in arteriogram and a clot has been extracted from the proximal left carotid, but there is still distal clot that they are working on. Dr. A has updated the family to her extremely guarded and critical prognosis.,At present, it is not known yet, we do not have the STAT echocardiogram, if she has a large clot in the heart or if she could have a patent foramen ovale clot in the legs that has been passed to the heart. Echo that is pending, and cannot be done till the patient is out of arteriogram, which is her lifesaving procedure right now.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:, Complete review of systems is unobtainable at present. From what I can tell, is that she is scheduled for an upcoming bladder distension surgery and I do not know if this is why she is off Coumadin for chronic AFib or what, at this point. Tremor for 3-4 years, diagnosed as early Parkinson's.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:, GERD, hypertension times 20 years, arthritis, Parkinson's, TIA, chronic atrial fibrillation, on Coumadin three years.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:, Cholecystectomy, TAH 33, gallstones, back surgery 1998, thoracotomy for unknown reason at present.,ALLERGIES:, MORPHINE, SULFAS (RASH), PROZAC.,MEDICATIONS AT HOME: Lanoxin 0.25 daily; Inderal LA 80 daily; MOBIC 7.5 daily; Robaxin 750 q.8; aspirin 80 one daily; acyclovir dose unknown daily; potassium, dose unknown; oxazepam 15 mg daily; aspirin 80 one daily; ibuprofen PRN; Darvocet-N 100 PRN.,SOCIAL HISTORY:, She does not drink or smoke. Lives in Fayetteville, Tennessee.,FAMILY HISTORY:, Mother died of cancer, unknown type. Dad died of an MI.,VACCINATION STATUS: Unknown.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS: On arrival were temperature 97.1, blood pressure 174/100, heart rate 100, 97%, respirations 15.,GENERAL: She was apparently alert and able to give history on arrival. Currently do not have any available vital signs or physical exam, as I cannot get to the patient.,LABORATORY: ,Reviewed and are remarkable for white count of 13 with 76 neutrophils. BMP is normal, except for a blood sugar of 157, hemoglobin A1c is pending. TSH 2.1, cholesterol 165, Digoxin 1.24, CPK 57. ABG 7.47/32/459 on 100%. Magnesium 1.5. ESR 9, coags normal.,EKG is pending my review.,Chest x-ray is read as mild cardiomegaly and atherosclerotic aorta.,Chest x-ray, shoulder films and CT scan of the head: I have reviewed. Chest x-ray has good ET tube placement. She has mild cardiomegaly. Some mild interstitial opacities consistent with OGD and minimal amount of atherosclerosis of the aorta.,CT scan of the head: I do not see any active bleeding.,X-rays of the shoulders appear intact to me and we are awaiting radiologies final approval on those.,ASSESSMENT/PLAN/PROBLEMS:,1. Large cardioembolic stroke initially to the right brain, with devastating effects, and now stroke into the left brain as well, with fluctuating mental status. Obviously she is in critical condition and stable with multiple strokes. One must also wonder if she could have a large clot burden below the heart and patent foramen ovale, etc. We need STAT records from her prior cardiologist and prior echocardiogram report to see exactly what are the details. I have ordered a STAT echo and to have the group that sees her read it, that if he has a large clot burdened in the heart or has distal clot with a PFO we may be able to better prognosticate at this point. Obviously, she cannot have any anticoagulants, except for the study drug, at present, which is her only chance and hopefully they will be able to retrieve most of the clot with emergency retrieval device as activated heroically, by Dr. A and interventional radiology.,2. Hypertension/atrial fibrillation: This will be a difficult management and the fact that she has been on a beta-blocker for Parkinson's, she may have withdrawal to the beta-blockers as we remove this. Given her atrial fibrillation, I do agree the safest agent right now is to use a Cardizem drip as needed and would use it for systolic greater than 160 to 180, or diastolics greater than 90 to 100. Also, would use it to control the atrial fibrillation. We would, however, be very cautious not to put her in heart block with the Digoxin and the beta-blocker on board. Weighing all risks and benefits, I think that given the fact that she has a beta-blocker on board and Digoxin, we would like to avoid the beta-blocker for vasospasm protection and will favor using calcium channel blocker for now. If, however, we run into trouble with this, I would prefer to switch her to Brevibloc or an Esmolol drip and see how she does, as she may withdraw from the beta-blocker. I will be watching this closely and managing the hypertension as I see fit at the moment, based on all factors. Will also ask cardiology if she has one that sees her here, to help guide this. Her Digoxin level is appropriate, as well as a TSH. I do not feel that we need to work this up further, other than the STAT echo and ultrasound of the leg.,3. Respiratory failure requiring ventilator: I have discussed this with Dr. Devlin, we do not feel the need to hyperventilate her at present. We will keep her comfortable on the breathing machine and try to keep her pH in a normal range, around 7.4, and her CO2 in the 30 to 40 range. If she has brain swelling, we will need to hyperventilate her to a pCO2 of 30 and a pH of 7.5, to optimize the cardiac arrhythmia potential of alkalosis weighed with the control of brain swelling.,4. Optimize electrolytes as you can.,5. Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis for now, with thigh-high TED hose, possibly SCDs, although I do not have experience with the vampire/venom to know if we need to worry about DIC which the SCDs may worsen. Will follow daily CBCs for that.,6. Nutrition: Will go ahead and start a low dose of tube feeds and hope that she does survive.,I will defer all updates to the family for the next 24 to 48 hours to Dr. Devlin's expertise, given her unknown and fluctuating neurologic prognosis.,Thank you so much for allowing us to participate in her care. We will be happy to do all medication treatment until the point that I feel that I would need any help from critical care. I believe that we will be able to manage her fully at this point, for simplicity sake.",1.0

After induction of IV sedation the left hand was anesthetized suitable for carpal tunnel release; 10 cc of a mixture of 1% Xylocaine and 0.5% Marcaine was injected in the distal forearm and proximal palm suitable for carpal tunnel surgery.  Routine prep and drape was employed.  Arm was exsanguinated by means of elevation of Esmarch elastic tourniquet and tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg pressure.  Hand was positioned palm up in the lead hand-holder.  A short curvilinear incision about the base of the thenar eminence was made.  Skin was sharply incised.  Sharp dissection was carried down to the transverse carpal ligament and this was carefully incised longitudinally along its ulnar margin.  Care was taken to divide the entire length of the transverse retinaculum including its distal insertion into deep palmar fascia in the midpalm.  Proximally the antebrachial fascia was released for a distance of 2-3 cm proximal to the wrist crease to insure complete decompression of the median nerve.  Retinacular flap was retracted radially to expose the contents of the carpal canal.  Median nerve was identified, seen to be locally compressed with moderate erythema and mild narrowing.  Locally adherent tenosynovium was present and this was carefully dissected free.  Additional tenosynovium was dissected from the flexor tendons, individually stripping and peeling each tendon in sequential order so as to debulk the contents of the carpal canal.  Epineurotomy and partial epineurectomy were carried out on the nerve in the area of mild constriction to relieve local external scarring of the epineurium.  When this was complete retinacular flap was laid loosely in place over the contents of the carpal canal and skin only was closed with interrupted 5-0 nylon horizontal mattress sutures.  A syringe with 3 cc of Kenalog-10 and 3 cc of 1% Xylocaine using a 25 gauge short needle was then selected; 1 cc of this mixture was injected into the third finger A1 and A2 pulley tendon sheaths using standard trigger finger injection technique; 1 cc was injected into the fourth finger A1/A2 pulley tendon sheath using standard tendon sheath injection technique; 1 cc was injected into the Dupuytren's nodule in the midpalm to relieve local discomfort.  Routine postoperative hand dressing with well-padded, well-molded volar plaster splint and lightly compressive Ace wrap was applied.  Tourniquet was deflated.  Good vascular color and capillary refill were seen to return to the tips of all digits.  Patient discharged to the ambulatory recovery area and from there discharged home.  Discharge medication is Darvocet-N 100, 30 tablets, one to two PO q.4h. p.r.n.  Patient asked to begin gentle active flexion, extension and passive nerve glide exercises beginning 24-48 hours after surgery.  She was asked to keep the dressings clean, dry and intact and follow up in my office.",2.0

Of note, there are no other enhancing solid masses seen on this MRI.  After discussion of multiple management strategies with the patient including:,1.  Left partial nephrectomy.,2.  Left radical nephrectomy.,3.  Left renal cyst decortication.  The patient is likely to undergo the latter procedure.,HOSPITAL COURSE:  ,The patient was admitted to undergo left renal cyst decortication as well as a cystoscopy.  Intraoperatively, approximately four enlarged renal cysts and six smaller renal cysts were initially removed.  The contents were aspirated and careful dissection of the cyst wall was performed.  Multiple specimens of the cyst wall were sent for pathology.  Approximately one liter of cystic fluid was drained during the procedure.  The renal bed was inspected for hemostasis, which appear to be adequate.  There were no complications with the procedure.  Single JP drain was left in place.  Additionally, the patient underwent flexible cystoscopy, which revealed no gross strictures or any other abnormalities in the penile nor prostatic urethra.  Furthermore, no gross lesions were encountered in the bladder.

His memory was intact for immediate, recent, and remote events.,He presented with poor appetite, easily fatigued, and decreased libidinal drive, as well as excessive somnolence.  There was a moderate preoccupation with his physical health pertaining to his headaches.  His judgment was poor for finances, family relations, social relations, employment, and, at this time, he had no future plans.  Mr. T's insight is somewhat moderate as he is aware of his contribution to the problem.  His motivation for getting well is good as he accepts offered treatment, complies with recommended treatment, and seeks effective treatments.  He has a well-developed empathy for others and capacity for affection.,There was no evidence of entitlement, egocentricity, controllingness, intimidation, or manipulation.  His credibility seemed good.  There was no evidence for potential self-injury, suicide, or violence.  The reliability and completeness of information was very good, and there were no barriers to communication.  The information gathered was based on the patient's self-report and objective testing and observation.  His attitude toward the examiner was neutral and his attitude toward the examination process was neutral.  There was no evidence for indices of malingering as there was no marked discrepancy between claimed impairment and objective findings, and there was no lack of cooperation with the evaluation or poor compliance with treatment, and no evidence of antisocial personality disorder.,IMPRESSIONS: , Major Depressive Disorder, single episode,RECOMMENDATIONS AND PLAN: , I recommend Mr. T continue with psychopharmacologic care as well as psychotherapy.  At this time, the excessive amount of psychiatric symptoms would impede Mr. T from seeking employment.  Furthermore, it appears that the primary precipitating event had occurred on March 25, 2003, when Mr. T was fired from his job after being harassed for over a year.  As Mr. T placed his entire identity and sense of survival on his work, this was a deafening blow to his psychological functioning.  Furthermore, it only appears logical that this would precipitate a major depressive episode.",2.0

She was noticed to be in atrial fibrillation, which is a chronic problem for her.  She did not want to have Coumadin started because she said that she has had it before and the INR has had been very difficult to regulate to the point that it was dangerous, but I convinced her to restart the Coumadin again.  I gave her the Coumadin as an outpatient and then the INR was found to be 12.  So, I told her to come to the emergency room to get vitamin K to reverse the anticoagulation.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,1.

Atrial fibrillation.,2.  Coagulopathy, induced by Coumadin.,PLAN: , Her INR at the office was 12.  I will repeat it, and if it is still elevated, I will give vitamin K 10 mg in 100 mL of D5W and then send her home and repeat the PT/INR next week.  I believe at this time that it is too risky to use Coumadin in her case because of her age and comorbidities, the multiple medications that she takes and it is very difficult to keep an adequate level of anticoagulation that is safe for her.  She is prone to a fall and this would be a big problem.  We will use one aspirin a day instead of the anticoagulation.  She is aware of the risk of stroke, but she is very scared of the anticoagulation with Coumadin and does not want to use the Coumadin at this time and I understand.  We will see her as an outpatient.",1.0
3477,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 63-year-old left-handed gentleman who presents for further evaluation of multiple neurological symptoms.  I asked him to discuss each symptom individually as he had a very hard time describing the nature of his problems.  He first mentioned that he has neck pain.  He states that he has had this for at least 15 years.  It is worse with movement.  It has progressed very slowly over the course of 15 years.  It is localized to the base of his neck and is sharp in quality.  He also endorses a history of gait instability.  This has been present for a few years and has been slightly progressively worsening.  He describes that he feels unsteady on his feet and ""walks like a duck.""  He has fallen about three or four times over the past year and a half.,He also describes that he has numbness in his feet.  When I asked him to describe this in more detail, the numbness is actually restricted to his toes.  Left is slightly more affected than the right.  He denies any tingling or paresthesias.  He also described that he is slowly losing control of his hands.  He thinks that he is dropping objects due to weakness or incoordination in his hands.  This has also been occurring for the past one to two years.  He has noticed that buttoning his clothes is more difficult for him.  He also does not have any numbness or tingling in the hands.  He does have a history of chronic low back pain.,At the end of the visit, when I asked him which symptom was most bothersome to him, he actually stated that his fatigue was most troublesome.  He did not even mention this on the initial part of my history taking.  When I asked him to describe this further, he states that he experiences a general exhaustion.  He basically lays in bed all day everyday.  I asked him if he was depressed, he states that he is treated for depression.  He is unsure if this is optimally treated.  As I just mentioned, he stays in bed almost all day long and does not engage in any social activities.  He does not think that he is necessarily sad.  His appetite is good.  He has never undergone any psychotherapy for depression.,When I took his history, I noticed that he is very slow in responding to my questions and also had a lot of difficulty recalling details of his history as well as names of physicians who he had seen in the past.  I asked if he had ever been evaluated for cognitive difficulties and he states that he did undergo testing at Johns Hopkins a couple of years ago.  He states that the results were normal and that specifically he did not have any dementia.,When I asked him when he was first evaluated for his current symptoms, he states that he saw Dr. X several years ago.  He believes that he was told that he had neuropathy but that it was unclear if it was due to his diabetes.  He told me that more recently he was evaluated by you after Dr. Y referred him for this evaluation.  He also saw Dr. Z for neurosurgical consultation a couple of weeks ago.  He reports that she did not think there was any surgical indication in his neck or back at this point in time.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , He has had diabetes for five years.  He also has had hypercholesterolemia.  He has had Crohn's disease for 25 or 30 years.  He has had a colostomy for four years.  He has arthritis, which is reportedly related to the Crohn's disease.  He has hypertension and coronary artery disease and is status post stent placement.  He has depression.  He had a kidney stone removed about 25 years ago.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , He takes Actos, Ambien, baby aspirin, Coreg, Entocort, folic acid, Flomax, iron, Lexapro 20 mg q.h.s., Lipitor, Pentasa, Plavix, Protonix, Toprol, Celebrex and Zetia.,ALLERGIES: , He states that Imuran caused him to develop tachycardia.,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  He previously worked with pipeline work, but has been on disability for five years.  He is unsure which symptoms led him to go on disability.  He has previously smoked about two packs of cigarettes daily for 20 years, but quit about 20 years ago.  He denies alcohol or illicit drug use.  He lives with his wife.  He does not really have any hobbies.,FAMILY HISTORY: , His father died of a cerebral hemorrhage at age 49.  His mother died in her 70s from complications of congestive heart failure.  He has one sister who died during a cardiac surgery two years ago.  He has another sister with diabetes.  He has one daughter with hypercholesterolemia.  He is unaware of any family members with neurological disorders.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , He has dyspnea on exertion.  He states that he was evaluated by a pulmonologist and had a normal evaluation.  He has occasional night sweats.  His hearing is poor.  He occasionally develops bloody stools, which he attributes to his Crohn's disease.  He also was diagnosed with sleep apnea.  He does not wear his CPAP machine on a regular basis.  He has a history of anemia.  Otherwise, a complete review of systems was obtained and was negative except for as mentioned above.  This is documented in the handwritten notes from today's visit.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,Vital Signs:  Blood pressure 160/86 HR 100 RR 16 Wt 211 pounds Pain 3/10,General Appearance:  He is well appearing in no acute distress.  He has somewhat of a flat affect.,Cardiovascular:  He has a regular rhythm without murmurs, gallops, or rubs.  There are no carotid bruits.,Chest:  The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.,Skin:  There are no rashes or lesions.,Musculoskeletal:  He has no joint deformities or scoliosis.,NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION:,Mental Status:  His speech is fluent without dysarthria or aphasia.  He is alert and oriented to name, place, and date.  Attention, concentration, and fund of knowledge are intact.  He has 3/3 object registration and 1/3 recall in 5 minutes.,Cranial Nerves:  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.  Visual fields are full.  Optic discs are normal.  Extraocular movements are intact without nystagmus.  Facial sensation is normal.  There is no facial, jaw, palate, or tongue weakness.  Hearing is grossly intact.  Shoulder shrug is full.,Motor:  He has normal muscle bulk and tone.  There is no atrophy.  He has few fasciculations in his calf muscles bilaterally.  Manual muscle testing reveals MRC grade 5/5 strength in all proximal and distal muscles of the upper and lower extremities.  There is no action or percussion myotonia or paramyotonia.,Sensory:  He has absent vibratory sensation at the left toe.  This is diminished at the right toe.  Joint position sense is intact.  There is diminished sensation to light touch and temperature at the feet to the knees bilaterally.  Pinprick is intact.  Romberg is absent.  There is no spinal sensory level.,Coordination:  This is intact by finger-nose-finger or heel-to-shin testing.  He does have a slight tremor of the head and outstretched arms.,Deep Tendon Reflexes:  They are 2+ at the biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, patellas, and ankles.  Plantar reflexes are flexor.  There is no ankle clonus, finger flexors, or Hoffman's signs.  He has crossed adductors bilaterally.,Gait and Stance:  He has a slightly wide-based gait.  He has some difficulty with toe walking, but he is able to walk on his heels and tandem walk.  He has difficulty with toe raises on the left.,RADIOLOGIC DATA: , MRI of the cervical spine, 09/30/08:  Chronic spondylosis at C5-C6 causing severe bilateral neuroforamining and borderline-to-mold cord compression with normal cord signal.  Spondylosis of C6-C7 causing mild bilateral neuroforamining and left paracentral disc herniation causing borderline cord compression.,Thoracic MRI spine without contrast:  Minor degenerative changes without stenosis.,I do not have the MRI of the lumbar spine available to review.,LABORATORY DATA: , 10/07/08:  Vitamin B1 210 (87-280), vitamin B6 6, ESR 6, AST 25, ALT 17, vitamin B12 905, CPK 226 (0-200), T4 0.85, TSH 3.94, magnesium 1.7, RPR nonreactive, CRP 4, Lyme antibody negative, SPEP abnormal (serum protein electrophoresis), but no paraprotein by manifestation, hemoglobin A1c 6.0, aldolase 3.9 and homocystine 9.0.,ASSESSMENT: , The patient is a 63-year-old gentleman with multiple neurologic and nonneurologic symptoms including numbness, gait instability, decreased dexterity of his arms and general fatigue.  His neurological examination is notable for sensory loss in a length-dependent fashion in his feet and legs with scant fasciculations in his calves.  He has fairly normal or very mild increased reflexes including notably the presence of normal ankle jerks.,I think that the etiology of his symptoms is multifactorial.  He probably does have a mild peripheral neuropathy, but the sparing of ankle jerks suggested either the neuropathy is mild or that there is a superimposed myelopathic process such as a cervical or lumbosacral myelopathy.  He really is most concerned about the fatigue and I think it is possible due to suboptimally treated depression and suboptimally treated sleep apnea.  Whether he has another underlying muscular disorder such as a primary myopathy remains to be seen.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,1.  I scheduled him for repeat EMG and nerve conduction studies to evaluate for evidence of neuropathy or myopathy.,2.  I will review his films at our spine conference tomorrow although I am confident in Dr. Z's opinion that there is no surgical indication.,3.  I gave him a prescription for physical therapy to help with gait imbalance training as well as treatment for his neck pain.,4.  I believe that he needs to undergo psychotherapy for his depression.  It may also be worthwhile to adjust his medications, but I will defer to his primary care physician for managing this or for referring him to a therapist.  The patient is very open about proceeding with this suggestion.,5.  He does need to have his sleep apnea better controlled.  He states that he is not compliant because the face mask that he uses does not fit him well.  This should also be addressed.",2.0

Radiofrequency cautery was used for hemostasis, and using a 5-0 undyed Vicryl skin was closed in the subcuticular plane and then skin was closed at the level of the skin with 4-0 nylon interrupted suture.,Next, attention was drawn to the mid back.  The skin was incised with a vertical elliptical incision with a 15-blade scalpel and then the mass was grasped with a Bishop forceps and excised with curved Iris scissors.  Afterwards, the skin was approximated using 4-0 nylon interrupted sutures.  Next, attention was drawn to the shoulder lesion.  It was previously marked and a 15-blade scalpel was used to make an elliptical incision into the skin.,Next, the skin was grasped with a small Bishop forceps and curved Iris scissors were used to dissect the skin ellipse and removed the skin.  The skin was undermined with the curved Iris scissors and then radio frequency treatment was used for hemostasis.,Next, subcuticular plain was closed with 5-0 undyed Vicryl interrupted suture.  Skin was closed with 4-0 nylon suture, interrupted.  Lastly, trichloroacetic acid chemical peel treatment to the left lateral nasal skin was performed.  Please refer to separate operative report for details.  The patient tolerated this procedure very well and we will follow up next week for postoperative re-evaluation or sooner if there are any problems.",2.0

1389,"Mr. XYZ forgot his hearing aids at home today and is severely hearing impaired and most of the interview had to be conducted with me yelling at him at the top of my voice.  For all these reasons, this was not really under the best circumstances and I had to curtail the amount of time I spent trying to get a history because of the physical effort required in extracting information from this patient.  The patient was seen late because he had not filled in the patient questionnaire.  To summarize the history here, Mr. XYZ who is not very clear on events from the past, sustained a work-related injury some time in 1998.  At that time, he was driving an 18-wheeler truck.  The patient indicated that he slipped off the rear of his truck while loading vehicles to his trailer.  He experienced severe low back pain and eventually a short while later, underwent a fusion of L4-L5 and L5-S1.  The patient had an uneventful hospital course from the surgery, which was done somewhere in Florida by a surgeon, who he does not remember.  He was able to return to his usual occupation, but then again had a second work-related injury in May of 2005.  At that time, he was required to boat trucks to his rig and also to use a chain-pulley system to raise and lower the vehicles.  Mr. XYZ felt a popping sound in his back and had excruciating low back pain and had to be transported to the nearest hospital.  He was MRI'ed at that time, which apparently showed a re-herniation of an L5-S1 disc and then, he somehow ended up in Houston, where he underwent fusion by Dr. W from L3 through S2.  This was done on 12/15/2005.  Initially, he did fairly well and was able to walk and move around, but then gradually the pain reappeared and he started getting severe left-sided leg pain going down the lateral aspect of the left leg into his foot.  He is still complaining of the severe pain right now with tingling in the medial two toes of the foot and significant weakness in his left leg.  The patient was referred to Dr. A, pain management specialist and Dr. A has maintained him on opioid medications consisting of Norco 10/325 mg for breakthrough pain and oxycodone 30 mg t.i.d. with Lunesta 3 mg q.h.s. for sleep, Carisoprodol 350 mg t.i.d., and Lyrica 100 mg q.daily.  The patient states that he is experiencing no side effects from medications and takes medications as required.  He has apparently been drug screened and his drug screening has been found to be normal.  The patient underwent an extensive behavioral evaluation on 05/22/06 by TIR Rehab Center.  At that time, it was felt that Mr. XYZ showed a degree of moderate level of depression.  There were no indications in the evaluation that Mr. XYZ showed any addictive or noncompliant type behaviors.  It was felt at that time that Mr. XYZ would benefit from a brief period of individual psychotherapy and a course of psychotropic medications.  Of concern to the therapist at that time was the patient's untreated and unmonitored hypertension and diabetes.  Mr. XYZ indicated at that time, they had not purchased any prescription medications or any of these health-related issues because of financial limitations.  He still apparently is not under really good treatment for either of these conditions and on today's evaluation, he actually denies that he had diabetes.  The impression was that the patient had axis IV diagnosis of chronic functional limitations, financial loss, and low losses with no axis III diagnosis.  This was done by Rhonda Ackerman, Ph.D., a psychologist.  It was also suggested at that time that the patient should quit smoking.  Despite these evaluations, Mr. XYZ really did not get involved in psychotherapy and there was poor attendance of these visits, there was no clearance given for any surgical interventions and it was felt that the patient has benefited from the use of SSRIs.  Of concern in June of 2006 was that the patient had still not stopped smoking despite warnings.  His hypertension and diabetes were still not under good control and the patient was assessed at significant risk for additional health complications including stroke, reduced mental clarity, and future falls.  It was felt that any surgical interventions should be put on hold at that time.  In September of 2006, the patient was evaluated at Baylor College of Medicine in the Occupational Health Program.  The evaluation was done by a physician at that time, whose report is clearly documented in the record.  Evaluation was done by Dr. B.  At present, Mr. XYZ continues on with his oxycodone and Norco.  These were prescribed by Dr. A two and a half weeks ago and the patient states that he has enough medication left to last him for about another two and a half weeks.  The patient states that there has been no recent change in either the severity or the distribution of his pain.  He is unable to sleep because of pain and his activities of daily living are severely limited.  He spends most of his day lying on the floor, watching TV and occasionally will walk a while.  ***** from detailed questioning shows that his activities of daily living are practically zero.  The patient denies smoking at this time.  He denies alcohol use or aberrant drug use.  He obtains no pain medications from no other sources.  Review of MRI done on 02/10/06 shows laminectomies at L3 through S1 with bilateral posterior plates and pedicle screws with granulation tissue around the thecal sac and around the left L4-5 and S1 nerve roots, which appear to be retracted posteriorly.  There is a small right posterior herniation at L1-L2.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Significant for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.

The patient is complaining of pain of a 9/10.,Musculoskeletal:  The patient's gait is markedly antalgic with predominant weightbearing on the left leg.  There is marked postural deviation to the left.  Because of pain, the patient is unable to heel-toe or tandem gait.  Examination of the neck and cervical spine are within normal limits.  Range of motion of the elbow, shoulders are within normal limits.  No muscle spasm or abnormal muscle movements noted in the neck and upper extremities.  Head is normocephalic.  Examination of the anterior neck is within normal limits.  There is significant muscle wasting of the quadriceps and hamstrings on the left, as well as of the calf muscles.  Skin is normal.  Hair distribution normal.  Skin temperature normal in both the upper and lower extremities.  The lumbar spine curvature is markedly flattened.  There is a well-healed central scar extending from T12 to L1.  The patient exhibits numerous positive Waddell's signs on exam of the low back with inappropriate flinching and wincing with even the lightest touch on the paraspinal muscles.  Examination of the paraspinal muscles show a mild to moderate degree of spasm with a significant degree of tenderness and guarding, worse on the left than the right.  Range of motion testing of the lumbar spine is labored in all directions.  It is interesting that the patient cannot flex more than 5  in the standing position, but is able to sit without any problem.  There is a marked degree of sciatic notch tenderness on the left.  No abnormal muscle spasms or muscle movements were noted.  Patrick's test is negative bilaterally.  There are no provocative facetal signs in either the left or right quadrants of the lumbar area.  Neurological exam:  Cranial nerves II through XII are within normal limits.

Severe cognitive impairment with minimal ***** for rehabilitation or return to work.,4.  Opioid dependence for pain control.,TREATMENT PLAN:,  The patient will continue on with his medications prescribed by Dr. Chang and I will see him in two weeks' time and probably suggest switching over from OxyContin to methadone.  I do not think this patient is a good candidate for spinal cord stimulation due to his grasp of exactly what is happening and his cognitive impairment.  I will get a behavioral evaluation from Mr. Tom Welbeck and refer the patient for ongoing physical therapy.  The prognosis here for any improvement or return to work is zero.",1.0

A concurrent vitrectomy and endolaser was performed by the vitreoretinal team.,INDICATION FOR SURGERY:  ,The patient is a 62-year-old white male who underwent cataract surgery in 09/06.  This was complicated by posterior capsule rupture.  An intraocular lens implant was not attempted.  He developed corneal edema and a preretinal hemorrhage.  He is aware of the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the surgery and now wishes to proceed with secondary scleral suture fixated posterior chamber intraocular lens implant in the left eye, vitrectomy, endolaser, and penetrating keratoplasty.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS:  ,1.

The patient's cornea sent to Eye Pathology.,PROS DEV IMPLANT:  ,ABC Laboratories 16.0 diopter posterior chamber intraocular lens, serial number 123456.,NARRATIVE: , Informed consent was obtained, and all questions were answered.  The patient was brought to the preoperative holding area, where the operative left eye was marked.  He was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  EKG leads were placed.  General anesthesia was induced.  The left ocular surface and periorbital skin were disinfected and draped in the standard fashion for eye surgery after a shield and tape were placed over the unoperated right eye.  A lid speculum was placed.  The posterior segment infusion was placed by the vitreoretinal service.  Peritomy was performed at the 3 and 9 o'clock limbal positions.  A large Flieringa ring was then sutured to the conjunctival surface using 8-0 silk sutures tied in an interrupted fashion.  The cornea was then measured and was found to accommodate a 7.5-mm trephine.  The center of the cornea was marked.  The keratoprosthesis was identified.,A 7.5-mm trephine blade was then used to incise the anterior corneal surface.  This was done after a paracentesis was placed at the 1 o'clock position and viscoelastic was used to dissect peripheral anterior synechiae.  Once the synechiae were freed, the above-mentioned trephination of the anterior cornea was performed.  Corneoscleral scissors were then used to excise completely the central cornea.  The keratoprosthesis was placed in position and was sutured with six interrupted 8-0 silk sutures.  This was done without difficulty.  At this point, the case was turned over to the vitreoretinal team, which will dictate under a separate note.  At the conclusion of the vitreoretinal procedure, the patient was brought under the care of the cornea service.  The 9-0 Prolene sutures double armed were then placed on each lens haptic loop.  The keratoprosthesis was removed.  Prior to this removal, scleral flaps were made, partial thickness at the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions underneath the peritomies.  Wet-field cautery also was performed to achieve hemostasis.  The leading hepatic sutures were then passed through the bed of the scleral flap.  These were drawn out of the eye and then used to draw the trailing hepatic into the posterior segment of the eye followed by the optic.  The trailing hepatic was then placed into the posterior segment of the eye as well.  The trailing haptic sutures were then placed through the opposite scleral flap bed and were withdrawn.  These were tied securely into position with the IOL nicely centered.  At this point, the donor cornea punched at 8.25 mm was then brought into the field.  This was secured with four cardinal sutures.  The corneal button was then sutured in place using a 16-bite 10-0 nylon running suture.  The knot was secured and buried after adequate tension was adjusted.  The corneal graft was watertight.  Attention was then turned back to the IOL sutures, which were locked into position.  The ends were trimmed.  The flaps were secured with single 10-0 nylon sutures to the apex, and the knots were buried.  At this point, the case was then turned back over to the vitreoretinal service for further completion of the retinal procedure.  The patient tolerated the corneal portions of the surgery well and was turned over to the retina service in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well.  No complications were noted.  The attending surgeon, Dr. X, performed the entire procedure.  No complications of the procedure were noted.  The intraocular lens was selected from preoperative calculations.  No qualified resident was available to assist.",2.0

4256,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , This 40-year-old white single man was hospitalized at XYZ Hospital in the mental health ward, issues were filled up by his sister and his mother.  The issues involved include the fact that for the last 10 years he has been on disability for psychiatric reasons and has been not working, and in the last several weeks to month he began to call his family talking about the fact that he had been sexually abused by brother.  He has been in outpatient therapy with Jeffrey Silverberg for the past 10 years and Mr. Silverberg became concerned about his behavior, called the family and told them to have him put in the hospital, and at one point called the police because the patient was throwing cellphones and having tantrums in his office.,The history includes the fact that the patient is the 3rd of 4 children.  A brother who is approximately 8 years older, sexually abused brother who is 4 years older.  The brother who is 8 years older lives in California and will contact the family, has had minimal contact for many years.,That brother in California is gay.  The brother who is 4 years older, sexually abused, the patient from age 8 to 12 on a regular basis.  He said, he told his mother several years ago, but she did nothing about it.,The patient finished high school and with some struggle completed college at the University of Houston.  He has a sister who is approximately a year and half younger than he is, who was sexually abused by the brothers will, but only on one occasion.  She has been concerned about patient's behavior and was instrumental in having him committed.,Reportedly, the patient ran away from home at the age of 12 or 13 because of the abuse, but was not able to tell his family what happened.,He had no or minimal psychiatric treatment growing up and after completing college worked in retail part time.,He states he injured his back about 10 yeas ago.  He told he had disk problems but never had surgery.  He subsequently was put on psychiatric disability for depression, states he has been unable to get out of bed at times and isolates and keeps to himself.,He has been on a variety of different medications including Celexa 40 mg and ADD medication different times, and reportedly has used amphetamines in the past, although he denies it at this time.  He minimizes any alcohol use which appears not to be a problem, but what does appear to be a problem is he isolates, stays at home, has been in situations where he brings in people he does not know well and he runs the risk of getting himself physically harmed.,He has never been psychiatrically hospitalized before.,MENTAL STATUS EXAMINATION:,  Revealed a somewhat disheveled 40-year-old man who was clearly quite depressed and somewhat shocked at his family's commitment.  He says he has not seen them on a regular basis because every time he sees them he feels hurt and acknowledged that he called up the brother who abused him and told the brother's wife what had happened.  The brother has a child and wife became very upset with him.,Normocephalic.  Pleasant, cooperative, disheveled man with about 37 to 40, thoughts were somewhat guarded.

2132,"SUBJECTIVE: , This patient presents to the office today with his mom for checkup.  He used to live in the city.  He used to go to college down in the city.  He got addicted to drugs.  He decided it would be a good idea to get away from the ""bad crowd"" and come up and live with his mom.  He has a history of doing heroin.  He was injecting into his vein.  He was seeing a physician in the city.  They were prescribing methadone for some time.  He says that did help.  He was on 10 mg of methadone.  He was on it for three to four months.  He tried to wean down on the methadone a couple of different times, but failed.  He has been intermittently using heroin.  He says one of the big problems is that he lives in a household full of drug users and he could not get away from it.  All that changed now that he is living with his mom.  The last time he did heroin was about seven to eight days ago.  He has not had any methadone in about a week either.  He is coming in today specifically requesting methadone.  He also admits to being depressed.  He is sad a lot and down.  He does not have much energy.  He does not have the enthusiasm.  He denies any suicidal or homicidal ideations at the present time.  I questioned him on the symptoms of bipolar disorder and he does not seem to have those symptoms.  His past medical history is significant for no medical problems.  Surgical history, he voluntarily donated his left kidney.  Family and social history were reviewed per the nursing notes.  His allergies are no known drug allergies.  Medications, he takes no medications regularly.,OBJECTIVE: , His weight is 164 pounds, blood pressure 108/60, pulse 88, respirations 16, and temperature was not taken.  General:  He is nontoxic and in no acute distress.  Psychiatric:  Alert and oriented times 3.  Skin:  I examined his upper extremities.  He showed me his injection sites.  I can see marks, but they seem to be healing up nicely.  I do not see any evidence of cellulitis.  There is no evidence of necrotizing fasciitis.,ASSESSMENT: , Substance abuse.,PLAN: , I had a long talk with the patient and his mom.  I am not prescribing him any narcotics or controlled substances.  I am not in the practice of trading one addiction for another.  It has been one week without any sort of drugs at all.  I do not think he needs weaning.  I think right now it is mostly psychological, although there still could be some residual physical addiction.  However, once again I do not believe it to be necessary to prescribe him any sort of controlled substance at the present time.  I do believe that his depression needs to be treated.  I gave him fluoxetine 20 mg one tablet daily.  I discussed the side effects in detail.  I did also warn him that all antidepressant medications carry an increased risk of suicide.  If he should start to feel any of these symptoms, he should call #911 or go to the emergency room immediately.  If he has any problems or side effects, he was also directed to call me here at the office.  After-hours, he can go to the emergency room or call #911.  I am going to see him back in three weeks for the depression.  I gave him the name and phone number of Behavioral Health and I told him to call so that he can get into rehabilitation program or at least a support group.  We are unable to make a referral for him to do that.  He has to call on his own.  He has no insurance.  However, I think fluoxetine is very affordable.  He can get it for $4 per month at Wal-Mart.  His mom is going to keep an eye on him as well.  He is going to be staying there.  It sounds like he is looking for a job.",1.0
53,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Bilateral undescended testes.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Bilateral undescended testes, bilateral intraabdominal testes.,PROCEDURE: , Examination under anesthesia and laparoscopic right orchiopexy.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  Less than 5 mL.,FLUIDS RECEIVED:  ,110 mL of crystalloid.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , Atrophic bilateral testes, right is larger than left.  The left had atrophic or dysplastic vas and epididymis.,TUBES AND DRAINS: , No tubes or drains were used.,INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION:  ,The patient is a 7-1/2-month-old boy with bilateral nonpalpable testes.  Plan is for exploration, possible orchiopexy.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified.  Once he was anesthetized, he was then palpated and again both testes were nonpalpable.  Because of this, a laparoscopic approach was then elected.  We then sterilely prepped and draped the patient, put an 8-French feeding tube in the urethra, attached to bulb grenade for drainage.  We then made an infraumbilical incision with a 15-blade knife and then further extended with electrocautery and with curved mosquito clamps down to the rectus fascia where we made stay sutures of 3-0 Monocryl on the anterior and posterior sheaths and then opened up the fascia with the curved Metzenbaum scissors.  Once we got into the peritoneum, we placed a 5-mm port with 0-degree short lens.  Insufflation was then done with carbon dioxide up to 10 to 12 mmHg.  We then evaluated.  There was no bleeding noted.  He had a closed ring on the left with a small testis that was evaluated and found to have short vessels as well as atrophic or dysplastic vas, which was barely visualized.  The right side was also intraabdominal, but slightly larger, had better vessels, had much more recognizable vas, and it was closer to the internal ring.  So, we elected to do an orchiopexy on the right side.  Using the laparoscopic 3- and 5-mm dissecting scissors, we then opened up the window at the internal ring through the peritoneal tissue, then dissected it medially and laterally along the line of the vas and along the line of the vessels up towards the kidney, mid way up the abdomen, and across towards the bladder for the vas.  We then used the Maryland dissector to gently tease this tissue once it was incised.  The gubernaculum was then divided with electrocautery and the laparoscopic scissors.  We were able to dissect with the hook dissector in addition to the scissors the peritoneal shunts with the vessels and the vas to the point where we could actually stretch and bring the testis across to the other side, left side of the ring.  We then made a curvilinear incision on the upper aspect of the scrotum on the right with a 15-blade knife and extended down the subcutaneous tissue with electrocautery.  We used the curved tenotomy scissors to make a subdartos pouch.  Using a mosquito clamp, we were able to go in through the previous internal ring opening, grasped the testis, and then pulled it through in a proper orientation.  Using the hook electrode, we were able to dissect some more of the internal ring tissue to relax the vessels and the vas, so there was no much traction.  Using 2 stay sutures of 4-0 chromic, we tacked the testis to the base of scrotum into the middle portion of the testis.  We then closed the upper aspect of the subdartos pouch with a 4-0 chromic and then closed the subdartos pouch and the skin with subcutaneous 4-0 chromic.  We again evaluated the left side and found again that the vessels were quite short.  The testis was more atrophic, and the vas was virtually nonexistent.  We will go back at a later date to try to bring this down, but it will be quite difficult and has a higher risk for atrophy because of the tissue that is present.  We then removed the ports, closed the fascial defects with figure-of-eight suture of 3-0 Monocryl, closed the infraumbilical incision with two Monocryl stay sutures to close the fascial sheath, and then used 4-0 Rapide to close the skin defects, and then using Dermabond tissue adhesives, we covered all incisions.  At the end of the procedure, the right testis was well descended within the scrotum, and the feeding tube was removed.  The patient had IV Toradol and was in stable condition upon transfer to recovery room.",2.0

The C-arm was brought into the operative field and AP, left right oblique and lateral fluoroscopic images of the L1-2 through L5-S1 levels were obtained.  We then proceeded to prepare the low back with a Betadine solution and draped sterile.  Using an oblique approach to the spine, the L5-S1 level was addressed using an oblique projection angled C-arm in order to allow for perpendicular penetration of the disc space.  A metallic marker was then placed laterally and a needle entrance point was determined.  A skin wheal was raised with 1% Xylocaine and an #18-gauge needle was advanced up to the level of the disc space using AP, oblique and lateral fluoroscopic projections.  A second needle, #22-gauge 6-inch needle was then introduced into the disc space and with AP and lateral fluoroscopic projections, was placed into the center of the nucleus.  We then proceeded to perform a similar placement of needles at the L4-5, L3-4 and L2-3 levels.,A solution of Isovue 300 with 1 gm of Ancef was then drawn into a 10 cc syringe and without informing the patient of our injecting, we then proceeded to inject the disc spaces sequentially.",2.0

Then a retrobulbar injection of 2% Xylocaine was performed.  A lid speculum was applied and the conjunctiva was opened 4 mm from the limbus.  A 2-0 traction suture was passed around the insertion of the lateral rectus and the temporal one-half of the globe was exposed.  Next, the plaque was identified and the two scleral sutures were removed.  The plaque was gently extracted and the conjunctiva was re-sutured with 6-0 catgut, following removal of the traction suture.  The fundus was inspected with direct ophthalmoscopy.  An eye patch was applied following Neosporin solution irrigation.  The patient was sent to the recovery room in good condition.  A lateral canthotomy had been done.",2.0
333,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Right pectoralis major tendon rupture.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Right pectoralis major tendon rupture.,OPERATION PERFORMED: , Open repair of right pectoralis major tendon.,ANESTHESIA:,  General with an interscalene block.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,Needle and sponge counts were done and correct.,INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  ,The patient is a 26-year-old right hand dominant male who works in sales, who was performing heavy bench press exercises when he felt a tearing burning pain severe in his right shoulder.  The patient presented with mild bruising over the proximal arm of the right side with x-ray showing no fracture.  Over concerns for pectoralis tendon tear, he was sent for MRI evaluation where a complete rupture of a portion of the pectoralis major tendon was noted.  Due to the patient's young age and active lifestyle surgical treatment was recommended in order to obtain best result.  The risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed in detail with the patient including, but not limited to scarring, infection, damage to blood vessels and nerves, re-rupture, need further surgery, loss of range of motion, inability to return to heavy activity such as weight lifting, complex usual pain syndrome, and deep vein thrombosis as well as anesthetic risks.  Understanding all risks and benefits, the patient desires to proceed with surgery as planned.,FINDINGS:,1.  Following deltopectoral approach to the right shoulder, the pectoralis major tendon was encountered.  The clavicular head was noted to be intact.  There was noted to be complete rupture of the sternal head of the pectoralis major tendon with an oblique-type tear having some remaining cuff on the humerus and some tendon attached to the retracted portion.,2.  Following freeing of adhesions using tracks and sutures, the pectoralis major tendon was able to reapproximated to its insertion site on the humerus just lateral to the biceps.,3.  A soft tissue repair was performed with #5 FiberWire suture and a single suture anchor of 5 x 5 bioabsorbable anchor was placed in order to decrease tension at the repair site.  Following repair of soft tissue and using the bone anchor, there was noted to be good apposition of the tendon with edges and a solid repair.,OPERATIVE REPORT IN DETAIL: , The patient was identified in the preop holding area.  His right shoulder was identified, marked his appropriate surgical site after verification with the patient.  He was then taken to the operating room where he was transferred to the operative table in supine position and placed under general anesthesia by anesthesiology team.  He then received prophylactic antibiotics.  A time-out was then undertaken verifying the correct patient, extremity, surgery performed, administration of antibiotics, and the availability of equipment.  At this point, the patient was placed to a modified beech chair position with care taken to ensure all appropriate pressure points were padded and there was no pressure over the eyes.  The right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Preoperative markings were still visible at this point.  A deltopectoral incision was made utilizing the inferior portion.  Dissection was carried down.  The deltoid was retracted laterally.  The clavicular head of the pectoralis major was noted to be intact with the absence of the sternal insertion.  There was a small cuff of tissue left on the proximal humerus associated with the clavicular head.  Gentle probing medially revealed the end of the sternal retracted portion, traction sutures of #5 Ethibond were used in this to allow for retraction and freeing from light adhesion.  This allowed reapproximation of the retracted tendon to the tendon stump.  At this point, a repair using #5 FiberWire was then performed of the pectoralis major tendon back to stump on the proximal humerus noting good apposition of the tendon edges and no gapping of the repair site.  At this point, a single metal suture anchor was attempted to be implanted just lateral to the insertion of the pectoralis in order to remove tension off the repair site; however, the inserted device attached to the metal anchor broke during insertion due to significant hardness of the bone.  For this reason, the starting hole was tapped and a 5x5 bioabsorbable anchor was placed, doubly loaded.  The sutures were then weaved through the lateral aspect of the torn tendon and a modified Krackow type performed and sutured thereby relieving tension off the soft tissue repair.  At this point, there was noted to be excellent apposition of the soft tissue ends and a solid repair to gentle manipulation.  Aggressive external rotation was not performed.  The wound was then copiously irrigated.  The cephalic vein was not injured during the case.  The skin was then closed using a 2-0 Vicryl followed by a 3-0 subcuticular Prolene suture with Steri-Strips.  Sterile dressing was then placed.  Anesthesia was then performed, interscalene block.  The patient was then awakened from anesthesia and transported to postanesthesia care in stable condition in a shoulder immobilizer with the arm adducted and internally rotated.,Plan for this patient, the patient will remain in the shoulder immobilizer until followup visit in approximately 10 days.  We will then start a gentle Codman type exercises and having limited motion until the 4-6 week point based on the patient's progression.",2.0

No evidence of ectopic pregnancy.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,PROCEDURE:,  After obtaining informed consent, the patient was taken to the operating room where general endotracheal anesthesia was administered.  She was examined under anesthesia.  An 8-10 cm anteverted uterus was noted.  The patient was placed in the dorsal-lithotomy position and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion, a sponge on a sponge stick was used in the place of a HUMI in order to not instrument the uterus in the event that this was a viable intrauterine pregnancy and this may be a desired intrauterine pregnancy.  Attention was then turned to the patient's abdomen where a 5-mm incision was made in the inferior umbilicus.  The abdominal wall was tented and VersaStep needle was inserted into the peritoneal cavity.  Access into the intraperitoneal space was confirmed by a decrease in water level when the needle was filled with water.  No peritoneum was obtained without difficulty using 4 liters of CO2 gas.  The 5-mm trocar and sleeve were then advanced in to the intraabdominal cavity and access was confirmed with the laparoscope.,The above-noted findings were visualized.  A 5-mm skin incision was made approximately one-third of the way from the ASI to the umbilicus at McBurney's point.  Under direct visualization, the trocar and sleeve were advanced without difficulty.  A third incision was made in the left lower quadrant with advancement of the trocar into the abdomen in a similar fashion using the VersaStep.  The peritoneal fluid was aspirated and sent for culture and wash and cytology.  The abdomen and pelvis were surveyed with the above-noted findings.  No active bleeding was noted.  No evidence of ectopic pregnancy was noted.  The instruments were removed from the abdomen under good visualization with good hemostasis noted.  The sponge on a sponge stick was removed from the vagina.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the recovery room in stable condition.,The attending, Dr. X, was present and scrubbed for the entire procedure.",2.0

The temporal artery was identified and was grossly normal on both sides.  Proximal and distal were ligated with both of 3-0 silk suture and Hemoccult.  The specimen of temporal artery was taken from both sides measuring at least 2 to 3 cm.  They were sent as separate specimens, right and left labeled.  The wound was then closed with interrupted 3-0 Monocryl subcuticular sutures and Dermabond.  She tolerated the procedure well.",2.0
2946,"Mr. XYZ forgot his hearing aids at home today and is severely hearing impaired and most of the interview had to be conducted with me yelling at him at the top of my voice.  For all these reasons, this was not really under the best circumstances and I had to curtail the amount of time I spent trying to get a history because of the physical effort required in extracting information from this patient.  The patient was seen late because he had not filled in the patient questionnaire.  To summarize the history here, Mr. XYZ who is not very clear on events from the past, sustained a work-related injury some time in 1998.  At that time, he was driving an 18-wheeler truck.  The patient indicated that he slipped off the rear of his truck while loading vehicles to his trailer.  He experienced severe low back pain and eventually a short while later, underwent a fusion of L4-L5 and L5-S1.  The patient had an uneventful hospital course from the surgery, which was done somewhere in Florida by a surgeon, who he does not remember.  He was able to return to his usual occupation, but then again had a second work-related injury in May of 2005.  At that time, he was required to boat trucks to his rig and also to use a chain-pulley system to raise and lower the vehicles.  Mr. XYZ felt a popping sound in his back and had excruciating low back pain and had to be transported to the nearest hospital.  He was MRI'ed at that time, which apparently showed a re-herniation of an L5-S1 disc and then, he somehow ended up in Houston, where he underwent fusion by Dr. W from L3 through S2.  This was done on 12/15/2005.  Initially, he did fairly well and was able to walk and move around, but then gradually the pain reappeared and he started getting severe left-sided leg pain going down the lateral aspect of the left leg into his foot.  He is still complaining of the severe pain right now with tingling in the medial two toes of the foot and significant weakness in his left leg.  The patient was referred to Dr. A, pain management specialist and Dr. A has maintained him on opioid medications consisting of Norco 10/325 mg for breakthrough pain and oxycodone 30 mg t.i.d. with Lunesta 3 mg q.h.s. for sleep, Carisoprodol 350 mg t.i.d., and Lyrica 100 mg q.daily.  The patient states that he is experiencing no side effects from medications and takes medications as required.  He has apparently been drug screened and his drug screening has been found to be normal.  The patient underwent an extensive behavioral evaluation on 05/22/06 by TIR Rehab Center.  At that time, it was felt that Mr. XYZ showed a degree of moderate level of depression.  There were no indications in the evaluation that Mr. XYZ showed any addictive or noncompliant type behaviors.  It was felt at that time that Mr. XYZ would benefit from a brief period of individual psychotherapy and a course of psychotropic medications.  Of concern to the therapist at that time was the patient's untreated and unmonitored hypertension and diabetes.  Mr. XYZ indicated at that time, they had not purchased any prescription medications or any of these health-related issues because of financial limitations.  He still apparently is not under really good treatment for either of these conditions and on today's evaluation, he actually denies that he had diabetes.  The impression was that the patient had axis IV diagnosis of chronic functional limitations, financial loss, and low losses with no axis III diagnosis.  This was done by Rhonda Ackerman, Ph.D., a psychologist.  It was also suggested at that time that the patient should quit smoking.  Despite these evaluations, Mr. XYZ really did not get involved in psychotherapy and there was poor attendance of these visits, there was no clearance given for any surgical interventions and it was felt that the patient has benefited from the use of SSRIs.  Of concern in June of 2006 was that the patient had still not stopped smoking despite warnings.  His hypertension and diabetes were still not under good control and the patient was assessed at significant risk for additional health complications including stroke, reduced mental clarity, and future falls.  It was felt that any surgical interventions should be put on hold at that time.  In September of 2006, the patient was evaluated at Baylor College of Medicine in the Occupational Health Program.  The evaluation was done by a physician at that time, whose report is clearly documented in the record.  Evaluation was done by Dr. B.  At present, Mr. XYZ continues on with his oxycodone and Norco.  These were prescribed by Dr. A two and a half weeks ago and the patient states that he has enough medication left to last him for about another two and a half weeks.  The patient states that there has been no recent change in either the severity or the distribution of his pain.  He is unable to sleep because of pain and his activities of daily living are severely limited.  He spends most of his day lying on the floor, watching TV and occasionally will walk a while.  ***** from detailed questioning shows that his activities of daily living are practically zero.  The patient denies smoking at this time.  He denies alcohol use or aberrant drug use.  He obtains no pain medications from no other sources.  Review of MRI done on 02/10/06 shows laminectomies at L3 through S1 with bilateral posterior plates and pedicle screws with granulation tissue around the thecal sac and around the left L4-5 and S1 nerve roots, which appear to be retracted posteriorly.  There is a small right posterior herniation at L1-L2.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Significant for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.

Hair distribution normal.  Skin temperature normal in both the upper and lower extremities.  The lumbar spine curvature is markedly flattened.  There is a well-healed central scar extending from T12 to L1.  The patient exhibits numerous positive Waddell's signs on exam of the low back with inappropriate flinching and wincing with even the lightest touch on the paraspinal muscles.  Examination of the paraspinal muscles show a mild to moderate degree of spasm with a significant degree of tenderness and guarding, worse on the left than the right.  Range of motion testing of the lumbar spine is labored in all directions.  It is interesting that the patient cannot flex more than 5  in the standing position, but is able to sit without any problem.  There is a marked degree of sciatic notch tenderness on the left.  No abnormal muscle spasms or muscle movements were noted.  Patrick's test is negative bilaterally.  There are no provocative facetal signs in either the left or right quadrants of the lumbar area.  Neurological exam:  Cranial nerves II through XII are within normal limits.  Neurological exam of the upper extremities is within normal limits with good motor strength and normal biceps, triceps and brachioradialis reflexes.

Severe cognitive impairment with minimal ***** for rehabilitation or return to work.,4.  Opioid dependence for pain control.,TREATMENT PLAN:,  The patient will continue on with his medications prescribed by Dr. Chang and I will see him in two weeks' time and probably suggest switching over from OxyContin to methadone.  I do not think this patient is a good candidate for spinal cord stimulation due to his grasp of exactly what is happening and his cognitive impairment.  I will get a behavioral evaluation from Mr. Tom Welbeck and refer the patient for ongoing physical therapy.  The prognosis here for any improvement or return to work is zero.",1.0

He has had a 2-day history of fever that has gone up to as high as 103.6 degrees F. He has also had intermittent cough, nasal congestion, and rhinorrhea and no history of rashes.  He has been taking Tylenol and Advil to help decrease the fevers, but the fever has continued to rise.  He was noted to have some increased workup of breathing and parents returned to the office on the day of admission.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Significant for being born at 33 weeks' gestation with a birth weight of 5 pounds and 1 ounce.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , On exam, he was moderately ill appearing and lethargic.  HEENT:  Atraumatic, normocephalic.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  Tympanic membranes were red and yellow, and opaque bilaterally.  Nares were patent.  Oropharynx was slightly moist and pink.  Neck was soft and supple without masses.  Heart is regular rate and rhythm without murmurs.  Lungs showed increased workup of breathing, moderate tachypnea.  No rales, rhonchi or wheezes were noted.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.  Active bowel sounds.  Neurologic exam showed good muscle strength, normal tone.  Cranial nerves II through XII are grossly intact.,LABORATORY FINDINGS: , He had electrolytes, BUN and creatinine, and glucose all of which were within normal limits.  White blood cell count was 8.6 with 61% neutrophils, 21% lymphocytes, 17% monocytes, suggestive of a viral infection.  Urinalysis was completely unremarkable.  Chest x-ray showed a suboptimal inspiration, but no evidence of an acute process in the chest.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , The patient was admitted to the hospital and allowed a clear liquid diet.  Activity is as tolerates.  CBC with differential, blood culture, electrolytes, BUN, and creatinine, glucose, UA, and urine culture all were ordered.  Chest x-ray was ordered as well with 2 views to evaluate for a possible pneumonia.  Pulse oximetry checks were ordered every shift and as needed with O2 ordered per nasal cannula if O2 saturations were less that 94%.  Gave D5 and quarter of normal saline at 45 mL per hour, which was just slightly above maintenance rate to help with hydration.  He was given ceftriaxone 500 mg IV once daily to treat otitis media and possible sepsis, and I will add Tylenol and ibuprofen as needed for fevers.  Overnight, he did have his oxygen saturations drop and went into oxygen overnight.  His lungs remained clear, but because of the need for O2, we instituted albuterol aerosols every 6 hours to help maintain good lung function.  The nurses were instructed to attempt to wean O2 if possible and advance the diet.  He was doing clear liquids well and so I saline locked to help to accommodate improve the mobility with the patient.  He did well the following evening with no further oxygen requirement.  He continued to spike fevers but last fever was around 13:45 on the previous day.  At the time of exam, he had 100% oxygen saturations on room air with temperature of 99.3 degrees F. with clear lungs.  He was given additional dose of Rocephin when it was felt that it would be appropriate for him to be discharged that morning.,CONDITION OF THE PATIENT AT DISCHARGE: , He was at 100% oxygen saturations on room air with no further dips at night.  He has become afebrile and was having no further increased work of breathing.,DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Bilateral otitis media.,2.  Fever.,PLAN:  ,Recommended discharge.

The patient states that she was knocked over by her friend's dog.  She sustained a subcapital left hip fracture.  Prior to admission, she lived alone in Terrano, was ambulating with a walker.  All risks, benefits, and potential complications of the procedure were then discussed with the patient and informed consent was obtained.,HARDWARE SPECIFICATIONS: , A 28 mm medium head was used, a small cemented femoral stem was used, and a 28 x 46 cup was used.,PROCEDURE:  ,All risks, benefits, and potential complications of the procedure were discussed with the patient, informed consent was obtained.  She was then transferred from the preoperative care unit to operating suite #1.  Department of Anesthesia administered spinal anesthetic without complications.,After this, the patient was transferred to the operating table and positioned.  All bony prominences were well padded.  She was positioned on a beanbag in the right lateral decubitus position with the left hip facing upwards.  The left lower extremity was then sterilely prepped and draped in the normal fashion.  A skin maker was then used to mark all bony prominences.  Skin incision was then carried out extending from the greater trochanter in a curvilinear fashion posteriorly across the buttocks.  A #10 blade Bard-Parker scalpel was used to incise the skin through to the subcutaneous tissues.  A second #10 blade was then used to incise through the subcutaneous tissue down to the fascia lata.  This was then incised utilizing Metzenbaum scissors.  This was taken down to the bursa, which was removed utilizing a rongeur.  Utilizing a periosteal elevator as well as the sponge, the fat was then freed from the short external rotators of the left hip after these were placed and stretched.  The sciatic nerve was then visualized and retracted utilizing a Richardson retractor.  Bovie was used to remove the short external rotators from the greater trochanter, which revealed the joint capsule.  The capsule was cleared and incised utilizing a T-shape incision.  A fracture hematoma was noted upon entering the joint capsule as well as subcapital hip fracture.  A cork screw was then used to remove the fractured femoral head, which was given to the scrub tech which was sized on the back table.  All bony remnants were then removed from the acetabulum and surrounding soft tissue with a rongeur.  Acetabulum was then inspected and found to be clear.  Attention was then turned to the proximal femur where a cutting tunnel was used to mark the femur for the femoral neck cut.  An oscillating saw was then used to make the femoral cut.  Box osteotome was then used to remove the bone from proximal femur.  A Charnley awl was then used to open the femoral canal, paying close attention to keep the awl in the lateral position.  Next, attention was turned to broaching.  Initially, a small broach was placed, first making efforts to lateralize the broach then the femoral canal.  It was felt that the patient has less benefit from a cemented prosthesis and a small size was appropriate.  Next, the trial components were inserted consisting of the above-mentioned component sizes.  The hip was taken through range of motion and tested to adduction, internal and external rotations as well as with a shuck and a posterior directed force on a flexed tip.  It was noted that these size were stable through the range of motion.  Next, the trial components were removed and the femoral canal was copiously irrigated and suctioned dried utilizing Super sucker and __________ then inserted pressuring the femoral canal.  The femoral component was then inserted and then held under pressure.  Extruding cement was removed from the proximal femur.  After the cement had fully hardened and dried, the head and cup were applied.  The hip was subsequently reduced and taken again through range of motion, which was felt to be stable.,Next, the capsule was closed utilizing #1 Ethibond in figure-of-eight fashion.  Next, the fascia lata was repaired utilizing a figure-of-eight Ethibond sutures.  The most proximal region at the musculotendinous junction was repaired utilizing a running #1 Vicryl suture.  The wound was then copiously irrigated again to suction dry.  Next, the subcutaneous tissues were reapproximated using #2-0 Vicryl simple interrupted sutures.  The skin was then reapproximated utilizing skin clips.  Sterile dressing was applied consisting of Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs as well as foam tape.  The patient was then transferred from the operating table to the gurney.  Leg lengths were checked, which were noted to be equal and abduction pillow was placed.  The patient was then transferred to the Postoperative Care Unit in stable condition.",2.0

The patient was recently thought to have obstruction to the transplant and a stent was placed in to the transplant percutaneously, but the ureter was wide open and there was no evidence of obstruction.  Because the kidney was felt to be irretrievably lost and immunosuppression had been withdrawn, it was elected to go ahead and remove the kidney and hopes that her fever and toxic course could be arrested.,With the patient in the supine position, the previously placed nephrostomy tube was removed.  The patient then after adequate prepping and draping, and placing of a small roll under the right hip, underwent an incision in the direction of the transplant incision down through and through all muscle layers and into the preperitoneal space.  The kidney was encountered and kidney was dissected free of its attachments through the retroperitoneal space.  During the course of dissection, the iliac artery and vein were identified as was the native ureter and the patient's ilioinguinal nerve; all these were preserved.  The individual vessels in the kidney were identified, ligated, and incised, and the kidney was removed.  The ureter was encountered during the course of resection, but was not ligated.

He has been given intravenous fluid at a high rate to replete intravascular volume and to hopefully address his acidosis.  The patient also has significant acidosis and his creatinine has increased from 2.1 to 4.2 overnight.  Given the fact that he would need dialytic support for his electrolyte derangements and for volume control, I would suggest continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration as opposed to conventional hemodialysis as the patient will not be able to tolerate conventional hemodialysis given his hemodynamic instability.,2.  Hypotension, which is significant and is related to his sepsis.  Now the patient has been maintained on Levophed and high rate of intravenous fluid at the moment.,3.  Acidosis, which is again secondary to his renal failure.  The patient was administered intravenous bicarbonate as mentioned above.  Dialytic support in the form of continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration was highly recommended for possible correction of his electrolyte derangements.,4.  Pancreatitis, which has been managed by his gastroenterologist.,5.  Sepsis, the patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy.,6.  Hypercalcemia.  The patient has been given calcium chloride.  We will need to watch for rebound hypercalcemia.,7.  Hypoalbuminemia.,8.  Hypokalemia, which has been repleted.,RECOMMENDATIONS: , Again include continuation of IV fluid and bicarbonate infusion as well as transfer to the Piedmont Hospital for continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration.",1.0

The patient was given Levaquin 500 mg by mouth as well as 2 doses of Phenergan over the course of his stay here in the emergency department.  The patient did not have an adverse reaction to these medicines either.  Phenergan resolved his nausea and morphine did relieve his pain and make him pain free.  I spoke with Dr. X, the patient's urologist, about most appropriate step for the patient, and Dr. X said he would be happy to care for the patient in the hospital and do urologic scopes if necessary and surgery if necessary and blood transfusion.  It was all a matter of what the patient wished to do given the advanced stage of his cancer.  Dr. X was willing to assist in any way the patient wished him to.  I spoke with the patient and his son about what he would like to do and what the options were from doing nothing from keeping him comfortable with pain medicines to admitting him to the hospital with the possibility of scopes and even surgery being done as well as the blood transfusion.  The patient decided to choose a middle ground in which he would be transfused with 2 units of blood here in the emergency room and go home tonight.  The patient's son felt comfortable with his father's choice.  This was done.  The patient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells after appropriately typed and match.  The patient did not have any adverse reaction at any point with his transfusion.  There was no fever, no shortness of breath, and at the time of disposition, the patient stated he felt a little better and felt like he had a little more strength.  Over the course of the patient's several-hour stay in the emergency room, the patient did end up developing enough problems with clotted blood in his bladder that he had a urinary obstruction.  Foley catheter was placed, which produced bloody urine and relieved the developing discomfort of a full bladder.

Right breast was slightly larger than the left this was repaired with a basic wise pattern reduction mammoplasty with anterior pedicle.,PROCEDURE,With the patient under satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia, the entire chest was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  A previously placed mark to identify the neo-nipple site was re-identified and carefully measured for asymmetry and appeared to be satisfactory.  A keyhole wire ring was then used to outline the basic wise pattern with 6-cm lamps inferiorly.  This was then carefully checked for symmetry and appeared to be satisfactory.  All marks were then completed and lightly incised on both breasts.  The right breast was approached first.  The neo-nipple site was de-epithelialized superiorly and then the inferior pedicle was de-epithelialized using cutting cautery.  After this had been completed, cutting cautery was used to carry down an incision along the inferior aspect of the periosteum starting immediately.  This was taken down to the prepectoral fashion dissected for short distance superiorly, and then blunt dissection was used to mobilize under the superior portion of the breast tissues to the lateral edge of the pectoral muscle.  There was very little bleeding with this procedure.  After this had been completed, attention was directed to the lateral side, and the inferior incision was made and taken down to the serratus.  Cautery dissection was then used to carry this up superiorly over the lateral edge of the pectoral muscle to communicate with the previous pocket.  After this had been completed, cutting cautery was used to cut around the inferior pedicle completely freeing the superior breast from the inferior breast.  Hemostasis was obtained with electrocautery.  After this had been completed, cutting cautery was used to cut along the superior edge of the redundant tissue and this was tapered under the superior flaps.  On the right side, there was a small palpable lobule, which had shown up on mammogram, but nothing except some fat density was identified.  This site had been previously marked carefully, and there were no unusual findings and the superior tissue was then sent out separately for pathology.  After this had been completed, final hemostasis obtained, and the wound was irrigated and a tagging suture placed to approximate the tissues.  The breast cleared and the nipple appeared good.,Attention was then directed to the left breast, which was completed in the similar manner.  After this had been completed, the patient was placed in a near upright position, and symmetry appeared good, but it was a bit poor on the lateral aspect of the right side, which was little larger and some suction lipectomy was carried out in this area.  After completion of this, 1860 grams had been removed from the right and 1505 grams was removed from the left.  Through separate stab wounds on the lateral aspect, 10-mm flat Blake drains were brought out and sutures were then placed **** and irrigated.  The wounds were then closed with interrupted 4-0 Monocryl on the deep dermis and running intradermal 4-0 Monocryl on the skin, packing sutures and staples were removed as they were approached.  The nipple was sutured with running intradermal 4-0 Monocryl.  Vascularity appeared good throughout.  After this had been completed, all wounds were cleaned and Steri-Stripped.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  All counts were correct.  Estimated blood loss was less than 150 mL, and she was sent to recovery room in good condition.",2.0

It showed marked GE reflux.,ASSESSMENT: , The differential diagnoses for patient included (a) chronic otitis media/treatment failure, (b) peptic ulcer disease/gastritis, (c) gastro esophageal reflux disease (GERD) or carbonated beverage syndrome, (d) trauma.,CHRONIC OTITIS MEDIA. , Chronic otitis media due to a penicillin resistant organism would be the obvious diagnosis in this case.  It is rare for an adolescent to have otitis media with no precipitating factor (such as being on a swim team or otherwise exposed to unusual organisms or in an unusual environment).  It is certainly unusual for him to have three episodes in 1 year.,PEPTIC ULCER DISEASE.,  There were no symptoms of peptic ulcer disease, a negative H. pylori screen and lack of pain made this diagnosis less likely.  Trauma.  Trauma was a possibility, particularly since adolescent males frequently minimize symptoms especially if they might limit participation in a sport but patient maintained that he had not had an event where he struck his head or neck and that he always wore his helmet with ear padding.,GERD.,  The history of ""heartburn"" relieved by his father's medication was striking.  The positive study supported the diagnosis of GERD, which was severe and chronic enough to cause irritation of the mucosal surfaces exposed to the gastric juices and edema, inflammation in the inner ears.,PLAN:,  Patient and his Mom agreed to a trial of omeprazole 20 mg at bedtime for 2 weeks.  Patient was to keep a diary of any episodes of heartburn, including what foods seemed to aggravate it.  The clinician asked him to avoid using any antacid products in the meantime to gage the effectiveness of the medication.  He was also given a prescription for 10 days of Augmentin99 and a follow-up appointment for 2 weeks.  At his follow-up appointment he reported one episode after he ate a whole large pizza after wrestling practice but said it went away pretty quickly after he took his medication.  A 6-month follow up appointment was scheduled.",1.0

Procedure was explained including risks of infection, bleeding, possibility of transfusion, possibility of further treatments being required.  Alternative of fully laparoscopic are open surgery or watching the lesion.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,In the right flank-up position, table was flexed.  He had a Foley catheter in place.  Incision was made from just above the umbilicus, about 5.5 cm in diameter.  The umbilical hernia was taken down.  An 11 mm trocar was placed in the midline, superior to the GelPort and a 5 mm trocar placed in the midaxillary line below the costal margin.  A liver retractor was placed to this.,The colon was reflected medially by incising the white line of Toldt.  The liver attachments to the adrenal kidney were divided and the liver was reflected superiorly.  The vena cava was identified.  The main renal vein was identified.  Coming superior to the main renal vein, staying right on the vena cava, all small vessels were clipped and then divided.  Coming along the superior pole of the kidney, the tumor was dissected free from top of the kidney with clips and Bovie.  The harmonic scalpel was utilized superiorly and laterally.

985,"ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS: , Right C5-C6 herniated nucleus pulposus.,PRIMARY OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , Anterior cervical discectomy at C5-6 and placement of artificial disk replacement.,SUMMARY:,  This is a pleasant, 43-year-old woman, who has been having neck pain and right arm pain for a period of time which has not responded to conservative treatment including ESIs.  She underwent another MRI and significant degenerative disease at C5-6 with a central and right-sided herniation was noted.  Risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed with her and she wished to proceed with surgery.  She was interested in participating in the artificial disk replacement study and was entered into that study.  She was randomly picked for the artificial disk and underwent the above named procedure on 08/27/2007.  She has done well postoperatively with a sensation of right arm pain and numbness in her fingers.  She will have x-rays AP and lateral this morning which will be reviewed and she will be discharged home today if she is doing well.  She will follow up with Dr. X in 2 weeks in the clinic as per the study protocol with cervical AP and lateral x-rays with ring prior to the appointment.  She will contact our office prior to her appointment if she has problems.  Prescriptions were written for Flexeril 10 mg 1 p.o. t.i.d. p.r.n.  #50 with 1 refill and Lortab 7.5/500 mg 1 to 2 q.6 h. p.r.n.  #60 with 1 refill.",1.0

Hospital-acquired pneumonia.,4.  Hypertension.,5.  Congestive heart failure.,6.  Seizure disorder.,PROCEDURES PERFORMED:,1.  Colonoscopy.,2.  Right hemicolectomy.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , The patient is a 59-year-old female with multiple medical problems including diabetes mellitus requiring insulin for 26 years, previous MI and coronary artery disease, history of seizure disorder, GERD, bipolar disorder, and anemia.  She was admitted due to a seizure and myoclonic jerks as well as hypoglycemia and anemia.  Regarding the seizure disorder, Neurology was consulted.  Noncontrast CT of the head was negative.  Neurology felt that the only necessary intervention at that time would be to increase her Lamictal to 150 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the evening with gradual increase of the dosage until she was on 200 mg b.i.d.  Regarding the hypoglycemia, the patient has diabetic gastroparesis and was being fed on J-tube intermittent feedings throughout the night at the rate of 120 an hour.  Her insulin pump had a basal rate of roughly three at night during the feedings.  While in the hospital, the insulin pump rate was turned down to 1.5 and then subsequently decreased a few other times.  She seemed to tolerate the insulin pump rate well throughout her hospital course.  There were a few episodes of hypoglycemia as well as hyperglycemia, but the episode seem to be related to the patient's n.p.o. status and the changing rates of tube feedings throughout her hospital course.,At discharge, her endocrinologist was contacted.  It was decided to change her insulin pump rate to 3 units per hour from midnight till 6 a.m., from 0.8 units per hour from 6 a.m. until 8 a.m., and then at 0.2 units per hour from 8 a.m. until 6 p.m.  The insulin was to be NovoLog.  Regarding the anemia, the gastroenterologists were consulted regarding her positive Hemoccult stools.  A colonoscopy was performed, which found a mass at the right hepatic flexure.  General Surgery was then consulted and a right hemicolectomy was performed on the patient.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and tube feeds were slowly restarted following the procedure, and prior to discharge were back at her predischarge rates of 120 per hour.  Regarding the cancer itself, it was found that 1 out of 53 nodes were positive for cancer.  CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed no metastasis, a CT of the chest revealed possible lung metastasis.  Later in hospital course, the patient developed a septic-like picture likely secondary to hospital-acquired pneumonia.  She was treated with Zosyn, Levaquin, and vancomycin, and tolerated the medications well.  Her symptoms decreased and serial chest x-rays were followed, which showed some resolution of the illness.  The patient was seen by the Infectious Disease specialist.  The Infectious Disease specialist recommended vancomycin to cover MRSA bacteria, which was found at the J-tube site.  At discharge, the patient was given three additional days of p.o. Levaquin 750 mg as well as three additional days of Bactrim DS every 12 hours.  The Bactrim was used to cover the MRSA at the J-tube site.  It was found that MRSA was sensitive to Bactrim.  Throughout her hospital course, the patient continued to receive Coreg 12.5 mg daily and Lasix 40 mg twice a day for her congestive heart failure, which remains stable.  She also received Lipitor for her high cholesterol.  Her seizure disorder remained stable and she was discharged on a dose of 100 mg in the morning and 150 mg at night.  The dosage increases can begin on an outpatient basis.,DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/MEDICATIONS: , The patient was discharged to home.  She was told to shy away from strenuous activity.  Her discharge diet was to be her usual diet of isotonic fiber feeding through the J-tube at a rate of 120 per hour throughout the night.  The discharge medications were as follows:,1.  Coreg 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.,2.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. at bedtime.,3.  Nitro-Dur patch 0.3 mg per hour one patch daily.,4.  Phenergan syrup 6.25 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n.,5.  Synthroid 0.175 mg p.o. daily.,6.

She was given a lab sheet to have a CBC with diff as well as a CMP to be drawn prior to her appointment with Dr. X.  She is instructed to follow up with Dr. Y if her condition changes regarding her colon cancer.  She was instructed to follow up with Dr. Z, her oncologist, regarding the positive lymph nodes.  We were unable to contact Dr. Z, but his telephone number was given to the patient and she was instructed to make a followup appointment.  She was also instructed to follow up with her endocrinologist, Dr. A, regarding any insulin pump adjustments, which were necessary and she was also instructed to follow up with Dr. B, her gastroenterologist, regarding any issues with her J-tube.,CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: , Stable.",1.0

Fusion C3-C4 and C2-C3 with instrumentation using ABC plates.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was placed in the supine position.  The neck was prepped and draped in the usual fashion for anterior cervical discectomy.  A high incision was made to allow access to C2-C3.  Skin and subcutaneous tissue and the platysma were divided sharply exposing the carotid sheath which was retracted laterally and the trachea and esophagus were retracted medially.  This exposed the vertebral bodies of C2-C3 and C4-C5 which was bridged by a plate.  We placed in self-retaining retractors.  With the tooth beneath the blades, the longus colli muscles were dissected away from the vertebral bodies of C2, C3, C4, and C5.  After having done this, we used the all-purpose instrumentation to remove the instrumentation at C4-C5, we could see that fusion at C4-C5 was solid.,We next proceeded with the discectomy at C2-C3 and C3-C4 with disc removal.  In a similar fashion using a curette to clean up the disc space and the space was fairly widened, as well as drilling up the vertebral joints using high-speed cutting followed by diamond drill bit.  It was obvious that the C3-C4 neural foramina were almost totally obliterated due to the osteophytosis and foraminal stenosis.  With the operating microscope; however, we had good visualization of these nerve roots, and we were able to ___________ both at C2-C3 and C3-C4.  We then placed the ABC 55-mm plate from C2 down to C4.  These were secured with 16-mm titanium screws after excellent purchase.  We took an x-ray which showed excellent position of the plate, the screws, and the graft themselves.  The next step was to irrigate the wound copiously with saline and bacitracin solution and s Jackson-Pratt drain was placed in the prevertebral space and brought out through a separate incision.  The wound was closed with 2-0 Vicryl for subcutaneous tissues and Steri-Strips used to close the skin.  Blood loss was about 50 mL.  No complication of the surgery.  Needle count, sponge count, cottonoid count was correct.,The operating microscope was used for the entirety for both visualization and magnification and illumination which was quite superb.  At the time of surgery, he had total collapse of the C2, C3, and C4 disc with osteophyte formation.  At both levels, he has high-grade spinal stenosis at these levels, especially foramen stenosis causing the compression, neck pain, headaches, and arm and shoulder pain.  He does have degenerative changes at C5-C6, C6-C7, C7-T1; however, they do not appear to be symptomatic, although x-rays show the disks to be partially collapsed at all levels with osteophyte formation beginning to form.",2.0

The patient was placed in the dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  A sterile speculum was placed in the patient's vagina and the anterior lip of the cervix was grasped with a vulsellum tenaculum.  The uterine manipulator was then placed into the patient's cervix and the vulsellum tenaculum and sterile speculum were removed.  Gloves were changed and attention was then turned to the abdomen where approximately 10 mm transverse infraumbilical incision was made.  Veress needle was placed through this incision and the gas turned on.  When good flow and low abdominal pressures were noted, the gas was turned up and the abdomen was allowed to insufflate.  A 11 mm trocar was then placed through this incision.  The camera was placed with the above findings noted.  A 5 mm step trocar was placed 2 cm superior to the pubic bone and along the midline.  A blunt probe was placed through this trocar to help for visualization of the pelvic and abdominal organs.  The serosanguineous fluid of the cul-de-sac was aspirated and the pelvis was copiously irrigated with sterile saline.  At this point, Dr. X was consulted.  He performed a rigid sigmoidoscopy, please see his dictation for further details.  There does not appear to be any evidence of colonic injury.  The saline in the pelvis was then suctioned out using Nezhat-Dorsey.  All instruments were removed.  The 5 mm trocar was removed under direct visualization with excellent hemostasis noted.  The camera was removed and the abdomen was allowed to desufflate.  The 11 mm trocar introducer was replaced and the trocar removed.  The skin was then closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion.  Approximately 10 cc of 0.25% Marcaine was injected into the incision sites for postoperative pain relief.  Steri-Strips were then placed across the incision.  The uterine manipulator was then removed from the patient's cervix with excellent hemostasis noted.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.

She has been receiving gemcitabine and carboplatin, and she receives three cycles of this with the last one being given on 12/15/08.  She was last seen in clinic on 12/22/08 by Dr. Y.  At that point, her white count was 0.9 with the hemoglobin of 10.3, hematocrit of 30%, and platelets of 81,000.  Her ANC was 0.5.  She was started on prophylactic Augmentin as well as Neupogen shots.  She has also had history of recurrent pleural effusions with the knee for thoracentesis.  She had two of these performed in November and the last one was done about a week ago.,Over the last 2 or 3 days, she states she has been getting more short of breath.  Her history is somewhat limited today as she is very tired and falls asleep readily.  Her history comes from herself but also from the review of the records.  Overall, her shortness of breath has been going on for the past few weeks related to her pleural effusions.  She was seen in the emergency room this time and on chest x-ray was found to have a new right-sided pulmonic consolidative infiltrate, which was felt to be possibly related to pneumonia.  She specifically denied any fevers or chills.  However, she was complaining of chest pain.  She states that the chest pain was located in the substernal area, described as aching, coming and going and associated with shortness of breath and cough.  When she did cough, it was nonproductive.  While in the emergency room on examination, her vital signs were stable except that she required 5 liters nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturations.  An EKG was performed, which showed sinus rhythm without any evidence of Q waves or other ischemic changes.  The chest x-ray described above showed a right lower lobe infiltrate.  A V/Q scan was done, which showed a small mismatched defect in the left upper lobe and a mass defect in the right upper lobe.  The findings were compatible with an indeterminate study for a pulmonary embolism.  Apparently, an ultrasound of the lower extremities was done and was negative for DVT.  There was apparently still some concern that this might be pulmonary embolism and she was started on Lovenox.  There was also concern for pneumonia and she was started on Zosyn as well as vancomycin and admitted to the hospital.,At this point, we have been consulted to help follow along with this patient who is well known to our clinic.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY,1.

4103,"She has a past ocular history including cataract extraction with lens implants in both eyes in 2001 and 2003.  She also has a history of glaucoma diagnosed in 1990 and macular degeneration.  She has been followed in her home country and is here visiting family.  She had the above-mentioned observation and was brought in on an urgent basis today.,Her past medical history includes hypertension and hypercholesterolemia and hypothyroidism.,Her medications include V-optic 0.5% eye drops to both eyes twice a day and pilocarpine 2% OU three times a day.  She took both the drops this morning.  She also takes Eltroxin which is for hypothyroidism, Plendil for blood pressure, and pravastatin.,She is allergic to Cosopt.,She has a family history of blindness in her brother as well as glaucoma and hypertension.,Her visual acuity today at distance without correction are 20/25 in the right and count fingers at 3 feet in the left eye.  Manifest refraction showed no improvement in either eye.  The intraocular pressures by applanation were 7 on the right and 18 in the left eye.  Gonioscopy showed grade 4 open angles in both eyes.  Humphrey visual field testing done elsewhere showed diffuse reduction in sensitivity in both eyes.  The lids were normal OU.  She has mild dry eye OU.  The corneas are clear OU.  The anterior chamber is deep and quiet OU.  Irides appear normal.  The lenses show well centered posterior chamber intraocular lenses OU.,Dilated fundus exam shows clear vitreous OU.  The optic nerves are normal in size.  They both appear to have mild pallor.  The optic cups in both eyes are shallow.  The cup-to-disc ratio in the right eye is not overtly large, would estimated 0.5 to 0.6; however, she does have very thin rim tissue inferotemporally in the right eye.  In the left eye, the glaucoma appears to be more advanced to the larger cup-to-disc ratio and a thinner rim tissue.,The macula on the right shows drusen with focal areas of RPE atrophy.  I do not see any evidence of neovascularization such as subretinal fluid, lipid or hemorrhage.  She does have a punctate area of RPE atrophy which is just adjacent to the fovea of the right eye.  In the left eye, she has also several high-risk drusen, but no evidence of neovascularization.  The RPE in the left eye does appear to be more diffusely abnormal although these changes do appear somewhat mild.  I do not see any dense or focal areas of frank RPE atrophy or hypertrophy.,The peripheral retinas are attached in both eyes.,Ms. ABC has pseudophakia OU which is stable and she is doing well in this regard.  She has glaucoma which likely is worse in the left eye and also likely explains her poor vision in the left eye.  The intraocular pressure in the mid-to-high teens in the left eye is probably high for her.  She has allergic reaction to Cosopt.  I will recommend starting Xalatan OS nightly.  I think the intraocular pressure in the right eye is acceptable and is probably a stable pressure for her OD.  She will need followup in the next 1 or 2 months after returning home to Israel later this week after starting the new medication which is Xalatan.,Regarding the macular degeneration, she has had high-risk changes in both eyes.  The vision in the right eye is good, but she does have a very concerning area of RPE atrophy just adjacent to the fovea of the right eye.  I strongly recommend that she see a retina specialist before returning to Israel in order to fully discuss prophylactic measures to prevent worsening of her macular degeneration in the right eye.",2.0

She reports a rotational sensation upon arising from the bed or chair that lasts for several minutes and requires her to sit back down and stay in one place.  She gets similar symptoms when she rolls over in bed.  She is not able to describe what direction she feels like she is spinning.  At times, she also feels as though she is going to pass out.  These sensations stop if she just sits in one place or lies down for several minutes.  She does note that it is worse when she turns to the right and when she turns to the left.  She also complains that she gets similar sensations when she looks up.  She denies any recent fever, chills, earache, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, other change in vision, or recent new headaches.

It includes potassium, Pravachol, Prevacid, Synthroid, Diovan, Amaryl, Vitamin B12, Coreg, Coumadin, furosemide, Actos, aspirin, colchicine, Cipro, Percocet, Ultram (has held the latter two medications for the past two weeks due to concerns of exacerbating dizziness).,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  Please see note in chart essentially entirely positive including cardiovascular problems of shortness of breath, PND and palpitations, chronic lack of energy, weight gain, the dizziness for which she presented.  Tinnitus in the right ear.  Diabetes and hypothyroidism.  Chronic nausea.  Chronic severe musculoskeletal pains to all extremities as well as to chest and abdomen and back.  Right-sided numbness as well as complaints of bilateral lower extremity numbness and difficulty walking.  She says her mood is sad and may be depressed and she is also extremely anxious.  She has chronic shortness of breath and coughs easily when has to breathe deeply.  She also endorses poor sleep.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS:  Sitting BP 112/84 with a pulse of 84, standing after two minutes 130/90 with a pulse of 66.  Respiratory rate is 20.  Weight is 257 pounds.  Pain scale is 7.,GENERAL:  This is a somewhat anxious elderly African-American female who tends to amplify findings on examination.  It is a difficult examination due to the fact that no matter where the patient was touched she would wince in pain and withdraw.  She is obese.,HEENT:  She is normocephalic and atraumatic.  Conjunctivae and sclerae are clear.  Tympanic membranes were visualized bilaterally.  There is tenderness to palpation of any sinus region.  There are no palpable cervical nodes.,NECK:  Supple although she complains of pain when rotating her neck.,CHEST:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.,HEART:  Heart sounds are distant.  There are no carotid bruits.,EXTREMITIES:  She has 1-2+ pitting edema to the mid shins bilaterally.,NEUROLOGIC EXAMINATION:,MENTAL STATUS:  She is alert and oriented x3.  Her speech is fluent; however, she is extremely tangential.  She is unable to give a cogent medical history including details of hospitalization one month ago when she was admitted for a gout attack and urinary tract infection and underwent several days of rehabilitation.,CRANIAL NERVES:  Cranial nerves are intact throughout; specifically there is no nystagmus, her gaze is conjugate, there is no diplopia, visual fields are full to confrontation, pupils are equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation, extraocular movements are intact, facial sensation and expression are symmetric, vestibuloocular reflexes are intact, hearing is intact to finger rub bilaterally, palate rises symmetrically, normal cough, shoulder shrug is symmetric which shows easy breakaway give, and tongue protrudes in the midline.,MOTOR:  This is a limited exam due to easy breakaway gait and pain that appears exaggerated to movement of any extremity.  There is suggestion of some mild right-sided paresis; however, the degree was inconsistent and her phasic strength is estimated at 4-4+ throughout.  Her tone is normal throughout.,SENSORY:  She appears to have diffuse light tough and pinprick and temperature to the right arm and proximal leg.  She also reports that she is numb in both feet; however, sensation testing of light tough, pinprick and vibration was intact.,COORDINATION:  There is no obvious dysmetria.,GAIT:  She uses a walker to stand up, and several near falls when asked to stand unassisted and can only ambulate with a walker.  There are some mild right lower extremity circumduction present.,REFLEXES:  Biceps 1, triceps trace, brachioradialis 1, patella and ankle absent.  Toes are equivocal.,OTHER:  Barany maneuver was attempted; however, when the patient was placed supine she immediately began screaming, ""Oh my back, oh my back"", and was unable to complete the maneuver.  Brief inspection of her eyes failed to show any nystagmus at that time.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN:,  This is a 77-year-old African-American female with multiple medical problems who presents with episodic positionally related dizziness of unclear etiology.  Most certainly there is significant exaggeration of the underlying problem and her neurological examination is compounded by much functional overlay, limiting the interpretation of my findings.  I suspect this is just a mild benign positional vertigo, although I cannot rule out vertebrobasilar compromise.  I agree with symptomatic treatment with Antivert.,We will schedule her for CT of head, CT angiogram to evaluate for possible brain stroke and vertebrobasilar insufficiency.  In addition, we will attempt to get further objective data by ENG testing.  I will see the patient again after these tests are completed and she has a trial of the Antivert.",1.0
933,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Displace subcapital fracture, left hip.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Displace subcapital fracture, left hip.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Austin-Moore bipolar hemiarthroplasty, left hip utilizing a medium fenestrated femoral stem with a medium 0.8 mm femoral head, a 50 mm bipolar cup.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to OR #2, administered a subarachnoid block anesthetic and was then positioned in the right lateral decubitus position on the beanbag on the operative table.  The right lower extremity was protectively padded.  The left leg was propped with multiple blankets.  The hip was then prepped and draped in the usual manner.  A posterior incision was made on the posterolateral aspect of the left hip down to the skin and subcutaneous tissues.  Hemostasis was achieved utilizing electrocautery.  Gluteus fascia was incised in line with a skin incision and the muscle was split posteriorly.  The external rotators were identified after removal of the trochanteric bursa.  Hemostat was utilized to separate the external rotators from the underlying capsule, they were then transected off from their attachment at the posterior intertrochanteric line.  They were then reflected distally.  The capsule was then opened in a T-fashion utilizing the cutting cautery.  Fraction hematoma exuded from the hip joint.  The cork screw was then impacted into the femoral head and it was removed from the acetabulum.  Bone fragments were removed from the neck and acetabulum.  The acetabulum was then inspected and noted to be free from debris.  The proximal femur was then delivered into the wound with the hip internally rotated.,A mortise chisel was then utilized to take the cancellous bone from the proximal femur.  The T-handle broach was then passed down the canal.  The canal was then sequentially broached up to a medium broach.  The calcar was then plained with the hand plainer.  The trial components were positioned into place.  The medium component fit fairly well with the medium 28 mm femoral head.  Once the trial reduction was performed, the hip was taken through range of motion.  There was physiologic crystalling with longitudinal traction.  There was no tendency towards dislocation with flexion of the hip past 90 degrees.  The trial implants were then removed.  The acetabulum was then copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution and suctioned dry.  The medium fenestrated femoral stem was prepared by placing a large segment of bone from the femoral head into the fenestration making it a little larger than the width of the implant to provide a press fit.  The implant was then impacted into place.  The 28 mm femoral head was impacted on the mortise stapler of the femoral stem followed by placement of the 50 mm bipolar cup.  The acetabulum was once again inspected, was free of debris.  The hip was reduced.  It was taken through full range of motion.  There was no tendency for dislocation.  The wound was copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution.  The capsule was then repaired with interrupted #1 Ethibond suture.  External rotators were then reapproximated to the posterior intertrochanteric line utilizing #1 Ethibond in a modified Kessler type stitch.  The wound was once again copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution and suctioned dry.  Gluteus fascia was approximated with interrupted #1 Ethibond.  Subcutaneous layers were approximated with interrupted #2-0 Vicryl and skin approximated with staples.  A bulky dressing was applied to the wound.  The patient was then transferred to the hospital bed, an abductor pillow was positioned into place.  Circulatory status was intact to the extremity at completion of the case.",2.0

KYPHON Balloon Kyphoplasty at T12 and L1evels Insertion of KYPHON HV-R bone cement under low pressure at T12 and L1 levels.,2.  Bone biopsy (medically necessary).,ANESTHESIA:, General,COMPLICATIONS:, None,BLOOD LOSS:, Minimal,INDICATIONS:,  Mrs. Smith is a 75-year-old female who has had severe back pain that began approximately three months ago and is debilitating.  She has been unresponsive to nonoperative treatment modalities including bed rest and analgesics.  She presents with and is on medication therapy for COPD, diabetes and hypertension (other co-morbidities may be present upon admission and should be documented in the operative note).,Radiographic imaging including MRI confirms multiple compression fractures of the thoracolumbar spine including T12, L1 and L2.  In addition to the fractures, she presents with kyphotic posture.  Films on 1/04 demonstrated L1 and L2 osteoporotic fractures.  Films on 2/04 demonstrated increased loss of height at L1.  Films on 3/04 demonstrated a new compression fracture at T12 and further collapse of L1.  The L2 fracture is documented on radiographic studies as being chronic and a year or more old.  The T12 fracture has the most significant kyphotic deformity.  Based on these findings, we have decided to perform KYPHON Balloon Kyphoplasty on the L1 and T12 fractures.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the operating room/radiology suite and general anesthesia/local sedation with endotracheal intubation was performed.  The patient was positioned prone on the Jackson table.  The back was prepped and draped.  The image intensifier (C-arm) was brought into position and the T12 pedicles were identified and marked with a skin marker.  In view of the collapse of T12, a transpedicular approach to the vertebral body was appropriate.  An 11-gauge needle was advanced through the T12 pedicle to the junction of the pedicle and vertebral body on the right side.  Positioning was confirmed on the AP and lateral plane.  Following satisfactory placement of the needle, the stylet was removed.  A guide pin was inserted through the 11g to a point 3mm from the anterior cortex.  AP and lateral images were taken to verify position and trajectory.  Alongside of the guide pin a 1-cm paramedian incision was made.  The needle was then removed leaving the guide pin in place.  The osteointroducer was placed over the guide pin and advanced through the pedicle.  Once I was at the junction of the pedicle and the vertebral body, a lateral image was taken to insure that the cannula was positioned approximately 1cm past the vertebral body wall.  Through the cannula, a drill was advanced into the vertebral body under fluoroscopic guidance toward the anterior cortex, creating a channel.  The anterior cortex was probed with the guide pin to ensure no perforations in the anterior cortex.  After completing the entry into the vertebral body, a 15 mm inflatable bone tamp was inserted through the cannula and advanced under fluoroscopic guidance into the vertebral body near the anterior cortex.  The radiopaque marker bands on the bone tamp were identified using AP and lateral images.  The above sequence of instrument placement was then repeated on the left side of the T12 vertebral body.  Once both bone tamps were in position, they were inflated to 0.5 cc and 50 psi.  Expansion of the bone tamps was done sequentially in increments of 0.25 to 0.5 cc of contrast, with careful attention being paid to the inflation pressures and balloon position.  The inflation was monitored with AP and lateral imaging.  The final balloon volume was 3.5 cc on the right side and 3 cc on the left.  There was no breach of the lateral wall or anterior cortex of the vertebral body.  Direct reduction of the fracture was achieved, end plate movement was noted and approximately 5 mm of height restoration was achieved.  Under fluoroscopic imaging, and the use of the bone void fillers, internal fixation was achieved through a low-pressure injection of KYPHON HV-R bone cement.  The cavity was filled with a total volume of 3.5 cc on the right side and 3 cc on the left side.  Once the bone cement had hardened, the cannulas were then removed.,At this time, we proceeded to perform a balloon kyphoplasty at L1 using the same sequence of steps as on T12.  An entry needle was placed bilaterally through the pedicle into the vertebral body, a cortical window was created, inflation of the bone tamps directly reduced the fracture, the bone tamps were removed, and internal fixation by bone void filler insertion was achieved.  Throughout the procedure, AP and lateral imaging monitored positioning.,Post-procedure, all incisions were closed with sutures.  The patient was kept in the prone position for approximately 10 minutes post cement injection.  She was then turned supine, monitored briefly and returned to the floor.  She was moving both her lower extremities at this time.,Throughout the procedure, there were no intraoperative complications.  Estimated blood loss was minimal.",2.0

Osteosynthesis of acetabular fracture on the left, complex variety.,2.  Total hip replacement.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient in the left side up lateral position under adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient's left lower extremity and buttock area were prepped with iodine and alcohol in the usual fashion, draped with sterile towels and drapes so as to create a sterile field.  Kocher Langenbeck variety incision was utilized and carried down through the fascia lata with the split fibers of the gluteus maximus in line.  The femoral insertion of gluteus maximus was tenotomized close to its femoral insertion.  The piriformis and obturator internus tendons and adjacent gemelli were tenotomized close to their femoral insertion, tagged, and retractor was placed in the lesser notch as well as a malleable retractor in the greater notch enabling the exposure of the posterior column.  The major transverse fracture was freed of infolded soft tissue, clotted blood, and lavaged copiously with sterile saline solution and then reduced anatomically with the aid of bone hook in the notch and provisionally stabilized utilizing a tenaculum clamp and definitively stabilized utilizing a 7-hole 3.5 mm reconstruction plate with the montage including two interfragmentary screws.  It should be mentioned that prior to reduction and stabilization of the acetabular fracture its femoral head component was removed from the joint enabling direct visualization of the articular surface.  Once a stable fixation of the reduced fracture of the acetabulum was accomplished, it should be mentioned that in the process of doing this, the posterior wall fragment was hinged on its soft tissue attachments and a capsulotomy was made in the capsule in line with the rent at the level of the posterior wall.  Once this was accomplished, the procedure was turned over to Dr. X and his team, who proceeded with placement of cup and femoral components as well and cup was preceded by placement of a trabecular metal tray for the cup with screw fixation of same.  This will be dictated in separate note.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The sciatic nerve was well protected and directly visualized to the level of the notch.",2.0

There are no adnexal masses appreciated.  On laparoscopic exam, the uterus is normal appearing but slightly compressible.  The bilateral tubes and ovaries appear normal.  There is evidence of endometriosis on the left pelvic sidewall in the posterior cul-de-sac.  There was no endometriosis in the right pelvic sidewall or along the bladder flap.,There were some adhesions on the right abdominal sidewall from the previous appendectomy.  The liver margin, gallbladder, and bowel appeared normal.  The uterus was sounded to 9 cm.,PROCEDURE: , After consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room and general anesthetic was administered.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion.  Sterile speculum was placed in the patient's vagina.  The anterior lip of the cervix was grasped with vulsellum tenaculum.  The uterus was sounded to 9 cm.  The cervix was then serially dilated with Hank dilators.  A sharp curettage was performed until a gritty texture was noted in all aspects of the endometrium.  The moderate amount of tissue that was obtained was sent to Pathology.  The #20 Hank dilator was then replaced and the sterile speculum was removed.  Gloves were changed and attention was then turned to the abdomen where approximately 10 mm transverse infraumbilical incision was made.  The Veress needle was placed into this incision and the gas was turned on.  When good flow and low abdominal pressures were noted, the gas was turned up and the abdomen was allowed to insufflate.  The #11 mm trocar was then placed through this incision and a camera was placed with the above findings noted.  A Bierman needle was placed 2 cm superior to the pubic bone and along the midline to allow a better visualization of the pelvic organs.  A 5 mm port was placed approximately 7 cm to 8 cm to the right of the umbilicus and approximately 3 cm inferior.  The harmonic scalpel was placed through this port and the areas of endometriosis were ablated using the harmonic scalpel.  A syringe was placed on to the Bierman needle and a small amount of fluid in the posterior cul-de-sac was removed to allow better visualization of the posterior cul-de-sac.  The lesions in the posterior cul-de-sac were then ablated using the Harmonic scalpel.  All instruments were then removed.  The Bierman needle and 5 mm port was removed under direct visualization with excellent hemostasis noted.  The camera was removed and the abdomen was allowed to desufflate.  The 11 mm trocar introducer was replaced and the trocar was removed.

The risks, benefits, and alternatives of surgery were discussed.  The risks of bleeding, infection, damage to nerves and blood vessels, persistent wound healing problems, and the need for future surgery.  He understood all the risks and desired operative treatment.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After appropriate informed consent obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  General anesthesia induced.  Once adequate anesthesia had been achieved, cast padding placed on the left proximal thigh and tourniquet was applied.  The right leg was redressed.  I took the dressing down.  There was a small bit of central drainage, but it was healing nicely.  Adaptic and new sterile dressings were applied.,The left lower extremity was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.,A transverse incision made about the mid shaft of the tibia.  A long posterior flap was created.  It was taken to the subcutaneous tissues with electrocautery.  Please note that tourniquet had been inflated after exsanguination of the limb.  Superficial peroneal nerve identified, clamped, and cut.  Anterior compartment was divided.  The anterior neurovascular bundle identified, clamped, and cut.  The plane was taken between the deep and superficial compartments.  The superficial compartment was reflected posteriorly.  Tibial nerve identified, clamped, and cut.  Tibial vessels identified, clamped, and cut.,Periosteum of the tibia elevated proximally along with the fibula.  The tibia was then cut with Gigli saw.  It was beveled anteriorly and smoothed down with a rasp.  The fibula was cut about a cm and a half proximal to this using a large bone cutter.  The remaining posterior compartment was divided.  The peroneal bundle identified, clamped, and cut.  The leg was then passed off of the field.  Each vascular bundle was then doubly ligated with 0 silk stick tie and 0 silk free tie.  The nerves were each pulled at length, injected with 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine, cut, and later retracted proximally.  The tourniquet was released.

The procedure was discussed with the patient and the patient opted for laparoscopic repair due to multiple attempts at the open inguinal repair on the right.  The patient also is requesting circumcision with phimosis at the same operating time setting.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , The patient was found to have a right inguinal hernia with omentum and bowel within the hernia, which was easily reduced.  The patient was also found to have a phimosis, which was easily removed.,PROCEDURE:,  After informed consent, the risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient.  The patient was brought to operating suite, after general endotracheal intubation, prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  An infraumbilical incision was made with a #15 Bard-Parker scalpel.  The umbilical skin was elevated with a towel clip and the Veress needle was inserted without difficulty.  Saline drop test proved entrance into the abdominal cavity and then the abdomen was insufflated to sufficient pressure of 15 mmHg.  Next, the Veress was removed and #10 bladed trocar was inserted without difficulty.  The 30-degree camera laparoscope was then inserted and the abdomen was explored.  There was evidence of a large right inguinal hernia, which had omentum as well as bowel within it, easily reducible.  Attention was next made to placing a #12 port in the right upper quadrant, four fingerbreadths from the umbilicus.  Again, a skin was made with a #15 blade scalpel and the #12 port was inserted under direct visualization.  A #5 port was inserted in the left upper quadrant in similar fashion without difficulty under direct visualization.  Next, a grasper with blunt dissector was used to reduce the hernia and withdraw the sac and using an Endoshears, the peritoneum was scored towards the midline and towards the medial umbilical ligament and lateral.  The peritoneum was then spread using the blunt dissector, opening up and identifying the iliopubic tract, which was identified without difficulty.  Dissection was carried out, freeing up the hernia sac from the peritoneum.  This was done without difficulty reducing the hernia in its entirety.  Attention was next made to placing a piece of Prolene mesh, it was placed through the #12 port and placed into the desired position, stapled into place in its medial aspect via the 4 mm staples along the iliopubic tract.  The 4.8 mm staples were then used to staple the superior edge of the mesh just below the peritoneum and then the patient was re-peritonealized, re-approximating edge of the perineum with the 4.8 mm staples.  This was done without difficulty.  All three ports were removed under direct visualization.  No evidence of bleeding and the #10 and #12 mm ports were closed with #0-Vicryl and UR6 needle.  Skin was closed with running subcuticular #4-0 undyed Vicryl.  Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied.  Attention was next made to carrying out the circumcision.  The foreskin was retracted back over the penis head.  The desired amount of removing foreskin was marked out with a skin marker.  The foreskin was then put on tension using a clamp to protect the penis head.  A #15 blade scalpel was used to remove the foreskin and sending off as specimen.  This was done without difficulty.  Next, the remaining edges were retracted, hemostasis was obtained with Bovie electrocautery and the skin edges were re-approximated with #2-0 plain gut in simple interrupted fashion and circumferentially.

He was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit.  He was rewarmed and had blood, sputum, and urine cultures done.  He was placed on IV Rocephin.  His usual medications of Dilantin and Depakene were given.  The patient's hypertension was treated with fluid boluses.  The patient was empirically placed on Synthroid and hydrocortisone by Dr. X.  Blood work consisted of a chemistry panel that was unremarkable, except for decreased proteins.  H&H was stable at 33.3/10.9 and platelets of 80,000.  White blood cell counts were normal, differential was normal.  TSH was 3.41.  Free T4 was 0.9.  Dr. X felt this was consistent with secondary hypothyroidism and recommended Synthroid replacement.  A cortisol level was obtained prior to administration of hydrocortisone.  This was 10.9 and that was not a fasting level.  Dr. X felt because of his hypothyroidism and his hypothermia that he had secondary adrenal insufficiency and recommended hydrocortisone and Florinef.  The patient was eventually changed to prednisone 2.5 mg b.i.d. in addition to his Florinef 0.1 mg on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.  The patient was started back on his tube feeds.

Akin bunionectomy, right toe with internal wire fixation.,ANESTHESIA: , TIVA/local.,HISTORY:  ,This 51-year-old female presents to ABCD preoperative holding area after keeping herself NPO since mid night for a surgery on her painful bunion through her right foot.  The patient has a history of gradual onset of a painful bunion over the past several years.  She has tried conservative methods such as wide shoes, accommodative padding on an outpatient basis with Dr. X all of which have provided inadequate relief.  At this time, she desires attempted surgical correction.  The risks versus benefits of the procedure have been discussed with the patient in detail by Dr. X and the consent is available on the chart for review.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room via cart and placed on the operative table in supine position and a safety strap was placed across her waist for her protection.  Copious amounts of Webril were applied about the right ankle and a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was placed over the Webril.,After adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 15 cc of 1:1 mixture of 0.5% Marcaine plain and 1% Lidocaine plain was injected into the foot in a standard Mayo block fashion.  The foot was elevated off the table.  Esmarch bandages were used to exsanguinate the right foot.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was lowered in the operative field and the sterile stockinet was reflected.  A sterile Betadine was wiped away with a wet and dry sponge and one toothpick was used to test anesthesia, which was found to be adequate.  Attention was directed to the first metatarsophalangeal joint, which was found to be contracted, laterally deviated, and had decreased range of motion.  A #10 blade was used to make a 4 cm dorsolinear incision.  A #15 blade was used to deepen the incision through the subcutaneous layer.  All superficial subcutaneous vessels were ligated with electrocautery.  Next, a linear capsular incision was made down the bone with a #15 blade.  The capsule was elevated medially and laterally off the metatarsal head and the metatarsal head was delivered into the wound.  A hypertrophic medial eminence was resected with a sagittal saw taking care not to strike the head.  The medial plantar aspect of the metatarsal head had some erosive changes and eburnation.  Next, a 0.45 inch Kirschner wire was placed with some access guide slightly plantar flexing the metatarsal taking care not to shorten it.  A sagittal saw was used to make a long-arm Austin osteotomy in the usual fashion.  Standard lateral release was also performed as well as a lateral capsulotomy freeing the fibular sesamoid complex.,The capital head was shifted laterally and impacted on the residual metatarsal head.  Nice correction was achieved and excellent bone to bone contact was achieved.  The bone stock was slightly decreased, but adequate.  Next, a 0.45 inch Kirschner wire was used to temporarily fixate the metatarsal capital fragment.  A 2.7 x 18 mm Synthes cortical screw was thrown using standard AO technique.  Excellent rigid fixation was achieved.  A second 2.0 x 80 mm Synthes fully threaded cortical screw was also thrown using standard AO technique at the proximal aspect of the metatarsal head.  Again, an excellent rigid fixation was obtained and the screws were tight.  The temporary fixation was removed.  A medial overhanging bone was resected with a sagittal saw.  The foot was loaded and the hallux was found to have an interphalangeus deformity present.,A sagittal saw was used to make a proximal cut in approximately 1 cm dorsal to the base of the proximal phalanx, leaving a lateral intact cortical hinge.  A distal cut parallel with the nail base was performed and a standard proximal Akin osteotomy was done.,After the wedge bone was removed, the saw blade was reinserted and used to tether the osteotomy with counter-pressure used to close down the osteotomy.  A #15 drill blade was used to drill two converging holes on the medial aspect of the bone.  A #28 gauge monofilament wire was inserted loop to loop and pulled through the bone.  The monofilament wire was twisted down and tapped into the distal drill hole.  The foot was loaded again and the toe had an excellent cosmetic straight appearance and the range of motion of the first metatarsophalangeal joint was then improved.  Next, reciprocating rasps were used to smooth all bony surfaces.  Copious amounts of sterile saline was used to flush the joint.  Next, a #3-0 Vicryl was used to reapproximate the capsular periosteal tissue layer.  Next, #4-0 Vicryl was used to close the subcutaneous layer.  #5-0 Vicryl was used to the close the subcuticular layer in a running fashion.  Next, 1 cc of dexamethasone phosphate was then instilled in the joint.  The Steri-Strips were applied followed by standard postoperative dressing consisting of Owen silk, 4 x 4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to the digits.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.  She was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the right foot.  She is to be partial weightbearing with crutches.  She is to follow with Dr. X.  She was given emergency contact numbers and instructions to call if problems arise.

He had an inguinal hernia on physical exam in the Pediatric Surgery Clinic and is here now for elective repair.  We met with his parents and explained the surgical technique, risks, and talked to them about trying to perform a diagnostic laparoscopic look at the contralateral side to rule out an occult hernia.  All their questions have been answered and they agreed with the plan.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS:  ,The patient had a well developed, but rather thin walled hernia sac on the right.  The thinness of hernia sac made it difficult to safely cannulate through the sac for the laparoscopy.  Therefore, high ligation was performed, and we aborted the plan for laparoscopic view of the left side.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient came to operating room and had an uneventful induction of general anesthesia.  Surgical time-out was conducted while we were preparing and draping his abdomen with chlorhexidine based prep solution.  During our time-out, we reiterated the patient's name, medical record number, weight, allergies status, and planned operative procedure.  I then infiltrated 0.25% Marcaine with dilute epinephrine in the soft tissues around the inguinal crease in the right lower abdomen chosen for hernia incision.  An additional aliquot of Marcaine was injected deep to the external oblique fascia performing the ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerve block.  A curvilinear incision was made with a scalpel and a combination of electrocautery and some blunt dissection and scissor dissection was used to clear the tissue layers through Scarpa fascia and expose the external oblique.  After the oblique layers were opened, the cord structure were identified and elevated.  The hernia sac was carefully separated from the spermatic cord structures and control of the sac was obtained.  Dissection of the hernia sac back to the peritoneal reflection at the level of deep inguinal ring was performed.  I attempted to gently pass a 3-mm trocar through the hernia sac, but it was rather difficult and I became fearful that the sac would be torn in proximal control and mass ligation would be less effective.  I aborted the laparoscopic approach and performed a high ligation using transfixing and a simple mass ligature of 3-0 Vicryl.  The excess sac was trimmed and the spermatic cord structures were replaced.  The external oblique fascia and Scarpa layers were closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl and skin was closed with subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Steri-Strips.  The patient tolerated the operation well.  Blood loss was less than 5 mL.  The hernia sac was submitted for specimen, and he was then taken to the recovery room in good condition.",2.0

An x-ray was done and I do not have an official interpretation, but to the admitting physician, Dr. X it showed no significant infiltrate.  Well at hospital, she had a rapid influenza swab done, which was negative.  She had a rapid RSV done, which is still not in the chart, but I believe I was told that it was negative.  She also had a pertussis PCR swab done and a pertussis culture done, neither of which has result in the chart.  I do know that the pertussis culture proved to be negative.,CONSULTATION: , Public Health Department was notified of a case of suspected pertussis.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , The baby was afebrile.  Required no oxygen in the hospital.  Actually fed reasonably well.  Did have one episode of coughing with slight emesis.  Appeared basically quite well between episodes.

History as well as signs and symptoms are consistent with acute appendicitis as was his CAT scan.  I evaluated the patient in the emergency room and recommended that he undergo the above-named procedure.  The procedure, purpose, risks, expected benefits, potential complications, alternative forms of therapy were discussed with him and he was agreeable with surgery.,FINDINGS: , Patient was found to have acute appendicitis with an inflamed appendix, which was edematous, but essentially no suppuration.,TECHNIQUE:  ,The patient was identified and then taken into the operating room, where after induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, the abdomen was prepped with Betadine solution and draped in sterile fashion.  An infraumbilical incision was made and carried down by blunt dissection to the level of the fascia, which was grasped with an Allis clamp and two stay sutures of 2-0 Vicryl were placed on either side of the midline.  The fascia was tented and incised and the peritoneum entered by blunt finger dissection.  A Hasson cannula was placed and a pneumoperitoneum to 15 mmHg pressure was obtained.  Patient was placed in the Trendelenburg position, rotated to his left, whereupon under direct vision, the 12-mm midline as well as 5-mm midclavicular and anterior axillary ports were placed.  The appendix was easily visualized, grasped with a Babcock's.  A window was created in the mesoappendix between the appendix and the cecum and the Endo GIA was introduced and the appendix was amputated from the base of the cecum.  The mesoappendix was divided using the Endo GIA with vascular staples.  The appendix was placed within an Endo bag and delivered from the abdominal cavity.  The intra-abdominal cavity was irrigated.  Hemostasis was assured within the mesentery and at the base of the cecum.  All ports were removed under direct vision and then wounds were irrigated with saline antibiotic solution.  The infraumbilical defect was closed with a figure-of-eight 0 Vicryl suture.  The remaining wounds were irrigated and then everything was closed subcuticular with 4-0 Vicryl suture and Steri-Strips.

Dissection was carried down to the ulnar nerve.  Branches of the medial antebrachial and the medial brachial cutaneous nerves were identified and protected.,Osborne's fascia was released, an ulnar neurolysis performed, and the ulnar nerve was mobilized.  Six cm of the medial intermuscular septum was excised, and the deep periosteal origin of the flexor carpi ulnaris was released to avoid kinking of the nerve as it was moved anteriorly.,The subcutaneous plane just superficial to the flexor-pronator mass was developed.  Meticulous hemostasis was maintained with bipolar electrocautery.  The nerve was transposed anteriorly, superficial to the flexor-pronator mass.  Motor branches were dissected proximally and distally to avoid tethering or kinking the ulnar nerve.,A semicircular medially based flap of flexor-pronator fascia was raised and sutured to the subcutaneous tissue in such a way as to prevent the nerve from relocating.  The subcutaneous tissue and skin were closed with simple interrupted sutures.  Marcaine with epinephrine was injected into the wound.  The elbow was dressed and splinted.  The patient was awakened and sent to the recovery room in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well.",2.0

4622,"OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:,1.  Redo coronary bypass grafting x3, right and left internal mammary, left anterior descending, reverse autogenous saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal and posterior descending branch of the right coronary artery.  Total cardiopulmonary bypass, cold-blood potassium cardioplegia, antegrade for myocardial protection.,2.  Placement of a right femoral intraaortic balloon pump.,DESCRIPTION: , The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  After adequate endotracheal anesthesia was induced, appropriate monitoring lines were placed.  Chest, abdomen an legs were prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  The femoral artery on the right was punctured and a guidewire was placed.  The track was dilated and intraaortic balloon pump was placed in the appropriate position, sewn in place and ballooning started.,The left greater saphenous vein was harvested from the groin to the knee and prepared by ligating all branches with 4-0 silk and flushed with vein solution.  The leg was closed with running 3-0 Dexon subcu and running 4-0 Dexon on the skin.,The old mediastinal incision was opened.  The wires were cut and removed.  The sternum was divided in the midline.  Retrosternal attachments were taken down.  The left internal mammary was dissected free from its takeoff at the left subclavian bifurcation at the diaphragm and surrounded with papaverine-soaked gauze.  The heart was dissected free of its adhesions.  The patient was fully heparinized and cannulated with a single aorta and single venous cannula.  Retrograde cardioplegia cannula was attempted to be placed, but could not be fitted into the coronary sinus safely, therefore, it was banded and oversewn with 5-0 Prolene.  An antegrade cardioplegia needle sump was placed and secured to the ascending aorta.  Cardiopulmonary bypass ensued.  The ascending aorta was cross clamped.  Cold-blood potassium cardioplegia was given antegrade, a total of 10 cc/kg.  It was followed by sumping the ascending aorta.  The obtuse marginal was identified and opened and an end-to-side anastomosis was performed with a running 7-0 Prolene suture.  The vein was cut to length.  Antegrade cardioplegia was given, a total of 200 cc.  The posterior descending branch of the right coronary artery was identified, opened and end-to-side anastomosis then performed with a running 7-0 Prolene suture.  The vein was cut to length.  Antegrade cardioplegia was given.  The mammary was clipped distally, divided and spatulated for anastomosis.  The anterior descending was identified, opened and end-to-side anastomosis then performed with running 8-0 Prolene suture and warm blood potassium cardioplegia was given.  The cross clamp was removed.  A partial-occlusion clamp was placed.  Aortotomies were made.  The vein was cut to fit these and sutured in place with running 5-0 Prolene suture.  The partial-occlusion clamp was removed.  All anastomoses were inspected and noted to be patent and dry.  Atrial and ventricular pacing wires were placed.  The patient was fully warmed and ventilation was commenced.  The patient was weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass, ventricular balloon pumping and inotropic support and weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass.  The patient was decannulated in routine fashion.  Protamine was given.  Good hemostasis was noted.  A single mediastinal chest tube and bilateral pleural Blake drains were placed.  The sternum was closed with figure-of-eight stainless steel wire.  The linea alba was closed with figure-of-eight of #1 Vicryl, the sternal fascia closed with running #1 Vicryl, the subcu closed with running 2-0 Dexon, skin with running 4-0 Dexon subcuticular stitch.

3633,"SUBJECTIVE:,  This is a 56-year-old female who comes in for a dietary consultation for hyperlipidemia, hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease and weight reduction.  The patient states that her husband has been diagnosed with high blood cholesterol as well.  She wants some support with some dietary recommendations to assist both of them in healthier eating.  The two of them live alone now, and she is used to cooking for large portions.  She is having a hard time adjusting to preparing food for the two of them.  She would like to do less food preparation, in fact.  She is starting a new job this week.,OBJECTIVE:,  Her reported height is 5 feet 4 inches.  Today‚Äôs weight was 170 pounds.  BMI is approximately 29.  A diet history was obtained.  I instructed the patient on a 1200 calorie meal plan emphasizing low-saturated fat sources with moderate amounts of sodium as well.  Information on fast food eating was supplied, and additional information on low-fat eating was also supplied.,ASSESSMENT:,  The patient‚Äôs basal energy expenditure is estimated at 1361 calories a day.  Her total calorie requirement for weight maintenance is estimated at 1759 calories a day.  Her diet history reflects that she is making some very healthy food choices on a regular basis.  She does emphasize a lot of fruits and vegetables, trying to get a fruit or a vegetable or both at most meals.  She also is emphasizing lower fat selections.  Her physical activity level is moderate at this time.  She is currently walking for 20 minutes four or five days out of the week but at a very moderate pace with a friend.  We reviewed the efforts at weight reduction identifying 3500 calories in a pound of body fat and the need to gradually and slowly chip away at this number on a long-term basis for weight reduction.  We discussed the need to reduce calories from what her current patterns are and to hopefully increase physical activity slightly as well.  We discussed menu selection, as well as food preparation techniques.  The patient appears to have been influenced by the current low-carb, high-protein craze and had really limited her food selections based on that.  I was able to give her some more room for variety including some moderate portions of potatoes, pasta and even on occasion breading her meat as long as she prepares it in a low-fat fashion which was discussed.,PLAN:,  Recommend the patient increase the intensity and the duration of her physical activity with a goal of 30 minutes five days a week working at a brisk walk.  Recommend the patient reduce calories by 500 daily to support a weight loss of one pound a week.  This translates into a 1200-calorie meal plan.  I encouraged the patient to keep food records in order to better track calories consumed.  I recommended low fat selections and especially those that are lower in saturated fats.  Emphasis would be placed on moderating portions of meat and having more moderate snacks between meals as well.  This was a one-hour consultation.  I provided my name and number should additional needs arise.",2.0

In the ER, she was given oral antibiotics.  She also saw me few days before admission coming for a followup.  She was doing fairly well.  She was thought to have congestive heart failure and she was advised to continue with her diuretics.  For the last few days, the patient started to have anorexia, she did not eat well, and she did not drink well.  Her family could not take care of her.  So, she was brought to the emergency room, where she was found to have rapid heart rate with a sinus tachycardia around 112 to 130s.  The ________ was found to be dry.  She was given 1 L of IV fluids and she was subsequently admitted in the hospital for further management.,COURSE IN THE HOSPITAL: , The patient stayed in the telemetry.  The patient had significant shortness of breath secondary to congestive heart failure with bilateral basilar crackles.  She was continued on IV antibiotics and general IV hydration was started initially because of low blood pressure and low perfusion status.  On subsequently improved and stopped and Lasix was started; Dr. X, cardiologist was also placed.  The patient's family wanted her to be a DNR and DNI.  They were allowing us to treat her aggressively medically for pneumonia and congestive heart failure.  However, the patient became extremely weak, mostly unresponsive.  At this time, the patient's family wanted a Hospice consult, which was requested.  By the time the Hospice could evaluate her, the patient's condition got deteriorated, she went into more bradycardiac and hypertension and subsequently expired.

2287,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: ,  The patient is a 48-year-old man who has had abdominal pain since October of last year associated with a 30-pound weight loss and then developed jaundice.  He had epigastric pain and was admitted to the hospital.  A thin-slice CT scan was performed, which revealed a 4 x 3 x 2 cm pancreatic mass with involved lymph nodes and ring enhancing lesions consistent with liver metastases.  The patient, additionally, had a questionable pseudocyst in the tail of the pancreas.  The patient underwent ERCP on 04/04/2007 with placement of a stent.  This revealed a strictured pancreatic duct, as well as strictured bile duct.  A 10-french x 9 cm stent was placed with good drainage.  The next morning, the patient felt quite a bit more comfortable.  He additionally had a modest drop in his bilirubin and other liver tests.  Of note, the patient has been having quite a bit of nausea during his admission.  This responded to Zofran.  It did not, initially, respond well to Phenergan, though after stent placement, he was significantly more comfortable and had less nausea, and in fact, had better response to the Phenergan itself.  At the time of discharge, the patient's white count was 9.4, hemoglobin 10.8, hematocrit 32 with a MCV of 79, platelet count of 585,000.

After excision of neoplasm, there was a separate 1 x 2 cm nodule palpated within the cavity.  This too was excised.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room, placed in supine position in the operating table.  Intravenous sedation was administered by the Anesthesia Department.  The Kopans wire was trimmed to an appropriate length.  The patient was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual manner.  Local anesthetic consisting of 1% lidocaine and 0.5% Marcaine was injected into the proposed line of incision.  A curvilinear circumareolar incision was then made with a #15 scalpel blade close to the wire.  The wire was stabilized and brought to protrude through the incision.  Skin flaps were then generated with electrocautery.  A generous core tissue was grasped with Allis forceps and excised with electrocautery.  Prior to complete excision, the superior margin was marked with a #2-0 Vicryl suture, which was tied and cut short.  The lateral margin was marked with a #2-0 Vicryl suture, which was tied and cut along.  The posterior margin was marked with a #2-0 Polydek suture, which was tied and cut.,The specimen was then completely excised and sent off the operative field as specimen where specimen mammography confirmed the excision of the mammographically detected neoplasm.  On palpation of the cavity, there was felt to be a second nodule further medial and this was grasped with an Allis forceps and excised with electrocautery and sent off the field as a separate specimen.  Hemostasis was obtained with electrocautery.  Good hemostasis was obtained.  The incision was closed in two layers.

I was called for persistent bleeding and passing large clots.  I examined the patient and found her to have at least 500 mL of clots in her uterus.  She was unable to tolerate exam any further than that because of concerns of the amount of bleeding that she had already had and inability to adequately evaluate her.  I did advise her that I would recommend they came under anesthesia and dilation and curettage.  Risks and benefits of this procedure were discussed with Misty, all of her questions were adequately answered and informed consent was obtained.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room where satisfactory conscious sedation was performed.  She was placed in the dorsal lithotomy position, prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Bimanual exam revealed moderate amount of clot in the uterus.  I was able to remove most of the clots with my hands and an attempt at short curettage was performed, but because of contraction of the uterus this was unable to be adequately performed.  I was able to thoroughly examine the uterine cavity with my hand and no remaining clots or placental tissue or membranes were found.  At this point, the procedure was terminated.

1111,"CHIEF COMPLAINT:,  Stage IIA right breast cancer.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,This is an extremely pleasant 58-year-old woman, who I am following for her stage IIA right breast cancer.  She noticed a lump in the breast in November of 2007.  A mammogram was obtained dated 01/28/08, which showed a mass in the right breast.  On 02/10/08, she underwent an ultrasound-guided biopsy.  The pathology showed an infiltrating ductal carcinoma Nottingham grade II.  The tumor was ER positive, PR positive and HER-2/neu negative.  On 02/22/08, she underwent a lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy.  The pathology showed a 3.3 cm infiltrating ductal carcinoma grade I, one sentinel lymph node was negative.  Therefore it was a T2, N0, M0 stage IIA breast cancer.  Of note, at that time she was taking hormone replacement therapy and that was stopped.  She underwent radiation treatment ending in May 2008.  She then started on Arimidex, but unfortunately she did not tolerate the Arimidex and I changed her to Femara.  She also did not tolerate the Femara and I changed it to tamoxifen.  She did not tolerate the tamoxifen and therefore when I saw her on 11/23/09, she decided that she would take no further antiestrogen therapy.  She met with me again on 02/22/10, and decided she wants to rechallenge herself with tamoxifen.  When I saw her on 04/28/10, she was really doing quite well with tamoxifen.  She tells me 2 weeks after that visit, she developed toxicity from the tamoxifen and therefore stopped it herself.  She is not going take to any further tamoxifen.,Overall, she is feeling well.

He was worked by the neurologist, Dr. X, and found to have cervical spondylosis with myelopathy.  I was consulted and elected to do a lumbar and cervical myelogram CT scan, which showed lumbar stenosis but also cervical stenosis with more pathology anteriorly than posteriorly.  The patient had worst disease at level C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6.  The patient was significantly weak and almost quadriparetic, stronger on the right side than on the left side.  I thought that surgery was indicated to prevent progressive neurological deterioration, as well as to prevent a central cord syndrome if the patient were to get into a motor vehicle accident or simply fall.  Conservative management was not an option.  The patient was preoped and consented, and was medically cleared.  I discussed the indications, risks, and benefits of the surgery with the patient and the patient's family.  The risks of bleeding, hoarseness, swallowing difficulty, pseudoarthrosis as well as plate migration and hardware failure were all discussed with the patient.  An informed consent was obtained from the patient as such.  He was brought into the OR today for the operative procedure.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought into the OR, intubated, and given a general anesthetic.  Intubation was done under C-spine precautions.  The patient received preoperative vancomycin and Decadron.  He was hooked up to the SSEP apparatus and had poor baselines and delays.,With a large a shoulder roll, I extended the patient's neck, and landmark incision in crease in the right upper neck, and the area was then prepped and sterilely draped.  All the lines had been put in and the arms were padded.,Using a knife and cautery, I took the incision down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue and arrived at the cervical spine.  Prominent osteophyte at C5-C6 was noted, lesser at C4-C5.  Intraoperative x-ray confirmed our levels, and we were fully exposed from C3-C6.,Trimline retractors were put in, and I cut the discs out as well as removed the superficial hyperstatic bone and osteophytes.,With the drill, I performed a superficial discectomy and endplate resection, curetting the endplate as I went.  I then brought in the microscope, under the microscopic guidance, firmly removed the end plates and drilled through the posterior longitudinal ligament to decompress the spinal cord.  Worst findings at C3-C4 followed C5-C6 and then C4-C5.  Excellent thecal sac decompression was achieved and foraminal decompression was also achieved.  With change in intraoperative monitoring, a microscope was used for this decompressive procedure.,The patient was very oozy throughout this procedure, and during the decompression part, the oozing was constant.  This was partly due to the patient's cancellous bone, but he had been on aspirin which was stopped only 2 days ago, and the option was not available to wait 2 to 3 weeks which would have made this man worse simply over time.  I thus elected to give him DDAVP, platelets, and used Horsley bone wax for excellent hemostasis.  This took literally half-an-hour to an hour and added to the complexity and difficulty of this case.  Eventually, with blood pressure controlled and all the other parameters under control, bleeding was somewhat slow.,I then selected two 10 and one 9-mm cadaveric allograft, which had soaking in bacitracin solution.  These were trimmed to the desired dimensions, and under slight distraction, these were tapped into position.  Excellent graft alignment was achieved.,I now brought in a DePuy titanium eagle plate, and I fixed it to the spine from C3 to C6.  Fourteen millimeter screws were used; all the screws were tightened and torqued.  The patient's bone quality was poor, but the screws did torque appropriately.  I inspected the plate, controlled the hemostasis, assessed post-fixation x-ray, and was really happy with the screw length and the overall alignment.,The wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution; a Jackson-Pratt drain 10-French was put in with trocar.  Decision was made to start the closure.  So, I closed the platysma with 3-0 Vicryl and used staples for the skin.  A simple Primapore or Medpore dressing was applied.  The patient was extubated in the OR and taken to the PSU in stable medical condition.,When I saw the patient in the ICU, he was awake, alert, and moving all four extremities, somewhat weak on the left side.  He had done well from the surgery.  Blood loss was 350 cc.  All instrument, needle, and sponge counts were correct.  No complications, no change in intraoperative monitoring.  No specimens were sent.,The patient's wife was spoken to and fully appraised of the intraoperative findings and the expected prognosis.  The patient will be kept n.p.o. tonight and will gradually advance his diet, and also will gradually advance his activity.  I will keep him on Decadron and keep the collar on.  I do not think there is need for halo rest.  We will be obtaining formal C-spine films in the morning.  Prognosis is guarded but favorable at this time.",1.0

Despite antacid therapy, the patient's pain has continued.  Additional findings were concerning with possibility of a biliary etiology.  The patient was explained the risks and benefits of an EGD as well as a Meltzer-Lyon test where upon bile aspiration was performed.  The patient agreed to the procedure and informed consent was obtained.,GROSS FINDINGS: , No evidence of neoplasia, mucosal change, or ulcer on examination.  Aspiration of the bile was done after the administration of 3 mcg of Kinevac.,PROCEDURE DETAILS: , The patient was placed in the supine position.  After appropriate anesthesia was obtained, an Olympus gastroscope inserted from the oropharynx through the second portion of duodenum.  Prior to this, 3 mcg of IV Kinevac was given to the patient to aid with the stimulation of bile.  At this time, the patient as well complained of epigastric discomfort and nausea.  This pain was similar to her previous pain.,Bile was aspirated with a trap to enable the collection of the fluid.  This fluid was then sent to lab for evaluation for crystals.  Next, photodocumentation obtained and retraction of the gastroscope through the antrum revealed no other evidence of disease, retroflexion revealed no evidence of hiatal hernia or other mass and after straightening the scope and aspiration ________, gastroscope was retracted.  The gastroesophageal junction was noted at 20 cm.  No other evidence of disease was appreciated here.  Retraction of the gastroscope backed through the esophagus, off the oropharynx, removed from the patient.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  We will await evaluation of bile aspirate.",2.0

A viable male neonate with Apgars of 9 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively.  Infant weight equaled to 4140 gm with clear amniotic fluid.  The umbilical cord was wrapped around the leg tightly x1.  Infant was in a vertex, right occiput anterior position.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:  ,The patient is a 19-year-old G1 P0 at 41 and 1/7th weeks' intrauterine pregnancy.  She presented at mid night on 08/22/03 complaining of spontaneous rupture of membranes, which was confirmed in Labor and Delivery.  The patient had a positive group beta strep colonization culture and was started on penicillin.  The patient was also started on Pitocin protocol at that time.  The patient was monitored throughout the morning showing some irregular contractions every 5 to 6 minutes and then eventually no contractions on the monitor.  IUPC was placed without difficulty and contractions appeared to be regular, however, they were inadequate amount of the daily units.  The patient was given a rest from the Pitocin.  She walked and had a short shower.  The patient was then placed back on Pitocin with IUPC in place and we were unable to achieve adequate contractions.  Maximum cervical dilation was 5 cm, 80% effaced, negative 2 station, and cephalic position.  At the time of C-section, the patient had been ruptured for over 24 hours and it was determined that she would not progress in her cervical dilation, as there was suspected macrosomia on ultrasound.  Options were discussed with the patient and family and it was determined that we will take her for C-section today.  Consent was signed.  All questions were answered with Dr. X present.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operative suite where a spinal anesthetic was placed.  She was placed in the dorsal supine position with left upward tilt.  She was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion and her spinal anesthetic was found to adequate.  A Pfannenstiel incision was made with a first scalpel and carried through the underlying layer of fascia with a second scalpel.  The fascia was incised in the midline and extended laterally using curved Mayo scissors.  The superior aspect of the fascial incision was grasped with Ochsner and Kocher clamps and elevated off the rectus muscles.  Attention was then turned to the inferior aspect of the incision where Kocher clamps were used to elevate the fascia off the underlying rectus muscle.  The rectus muscle was separated in the midline bluntly.  The underlying peritoneum was tented up with Allis clamps and incised using Metzenbaum scissors.  The peritoneum was then bluntly stretched.  The bladder blade was placed.  The vesicouterine peritoneum was identified, tented up with Allis' and entered sharply with Metzenbaum scissors.  The incision was extended laterally and the bladder flap created digitally.  The bladder blade was then reinserted in the lower uterine segment.  A low transverse uterine incision was made with a second scalpel.  The uterine incision was extended laterally bluntly.  The bladder blade was removed and the infant's head was delivered with the assistance of a vacuum.  Infant's nose and mouth were bulb suctioned and the body was delivered atraumatically.  There was, of note, an umbilical cord around the leg tightly x1.,Cord was clamped and cut.  Infant was handed to the waiting pediatrician.  Cord gas was sent for pH as well as blood typing.  The placenta was manually removed and the uterus was exteriorized and cleared of all clots and debris.  The uterine incision was grasped circumferentially with Alfred clamps and closed with #0-Chromic in a running locked fashion.  A second layer of imbricating stitch was performed using #0-Chromic suture to obtain excellent hemostasis.  The uterus was returned to the abdomen.  The gutters were cleared of all clots and debris.  The rectus muscle was loosely approximated with #0-Vicryl suture in a single interrupted fashion.  The fascia was reapproximated with #0-Vicryl suture in a running fashion.  The subcutaneous Scarpa's fascia was then closed with #2-0 plain gut.  The skin was then closed with staples.  The incision was dressed with sterile dressing and bandage.  Blood clots were evacuated from the vagina.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x2.  The mother was taken to the recovery room in stable and satisfactory condition.",2.0

4555,"OPERATION PERFORMED:,  Ligament reconstruction and tendon interposition arthroplasty of right wrist.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , With the patient under adequate anesthesia, the right upper extremity was prepped and draped in a sterile manner.,Attention was turned to the base of the thumb where a longitudinal incision was made over the anatomic snuffbox and extended out onto the carpometacarpal joint.  Using blunt dissection radial sensory nerve was dissected and retracted out of the operative field.  Further blunt dissection exposed the radial artery, which was dissected and retracted off the trapezium.  An incision was then made across the scaphotrapezial joint distally onto the trapezium and out onto the carpometacarpal joint.  Sharp dissection exposed the trapezium, which was then morselized and removed in toto with care taken to protect the underlying flexor carpi radialis tendon.  The radial beak of the trapezoid was then osteotomized off the head of the scaphoid.  The proximal metacarpal was then fenestrated with a 4.5-mm drill bit.  Four fingers proximal to the flexion crease of the wrist a small incision was made over the FCR tendon and blunt dissection delivered the FCR tendon into this incision.  The FCR tendon was divided and this incision was closed with 4-0 nylon sutures.  Attention was returned to the trapezial wound where longitudinal traction on the FCR tendon delivered the FCR tendon into the wound.,The FCR tendon was then threaded through the fenestration in the metacarpal.  A bone anchor was then placed distal to the metacarpal fenestration.  The FCR tendon was then pulled distally and the metacarpal reduced to an anatomic position.  The FCR tendon was then sutured to the metacarpal using the previously placed bone anchor.  Remaining FCR tendon was then anchovied and placed into the scaphotrapezoidal and trapezial defect.  The MP joint was brought into extension and the capsule closed using interrupted 3-0 Tycron sutures.,Attention was turned to the MCP joint where the MP joint was brought in to 15 degrees of flexion and pinned with a single 0.035 Kirschner wire.  The pin was cut at the level of the skin.,All incisions were closed with running 3-0 Prolene subcuticular stitch.,Sterile dressings were then applied.  The tourniquet was deflated.  The patient was awakened from anesthesia and returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition having tolerated the procedure well.",2.0

A transverse scrotal incision was made and carried down to the tunica vaginalis, which was opened.  A small amount of clear fluid was expressed.  The tunica vaginalis was opened and the testicle was brought out through this incision.  The epididymis was separated off the surface of the testicle using a scalpel.  With blunt and sharp dissection, the epididymis was dissected off the testicle.  Bovie was used for hemostasis.  The vessels going to the testicle were preserved without any obvious injury, and a nice viable testicle was present after the epididymis was removed from this.  The blood supply to the epididymis was cauterized using a Bovie and the vas was divided with cautery also.  There was no obvious bleeding.  The cord was infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine, as was the dartos tissue in the scrotum.  The testicle was replaced in the scrotum.

2535,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension, mild aortic stenosis, and previously moderate mitral regurgitation although not seen recently and I was asked to perform cardiology consultation for her because there was concern for atrial fibrillation after a fall.  Basically the patient states that yesterday she fell and she is not certain about the circumstances, on her driveway, and on her left side hit a rock.  When she came to the emergency room, she was found to have a rapid atrial tachyarrhythmia, and was put on Cardizem with reportedly heart rate in the 50s, so that was stopped.  Review of EKGs from that time shows what appears to be multifocal atrial tachycardia with followup EKG showing wandering atrial pacemaker.  An ECG this morning showing normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs.  Her potassium at that time was 3.1.  She does recall having palpitations because of the pain after the fall, but she states she is not having them since and has not had them prior.  She denies any chest pain nor shortness of breath prior to or since the fall.  She states clearly she can walk and she would be able to climb 2 flights of stairs without problems.,PAST CARDIAC HISTORY: , She is followed by Dr. X in our office and has a history of severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild elevation and PA pressure.  On 05/12/08, preserved left and right ventricular systolic function, aortic sclerosis with apparent mild aortic stenosis, and bi-atrial enlargement.  She has previously had a Persantine Myoview nuclear rest-stress test scan completed at ABCD Medical Center in 07/06 that was negative.  She has had significant mitral valve regurgitation in the past being moderate, but on the most recent echocardiogram on 05/12/08, that was not felt to be significant.  She has a history of hypertension and EKGs in our office show normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs versus wandering atrial pacemaker.  She does have a history of significant hypertension in the past.  She has had dizzy spells and denies clearly any true syncope.  She has had bradycardia in the past from beta-blocker therapy.,MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:,1.  Multivitamin p.o. daily.,2.  Aspirin 325 mg once a day.,3.  Lisinopril 40 mg once a day.,4.

She is retired from Morse Chain and delivering newspapers.  She is widowed.  She lives alone but has family members who live either on her property or adjacent to it.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , She denies a history of stroke, cancer, vomiting of blood, coughing up blood, bright red blood per rectum, bleeding, stomach ulcers.  She does not recall renal calculi, nor cholelithiasis, denies asthma, emphysema, pneumonia, tuberculosis, sleep apnea, home oxygen use.  She does note occasional peripheral edema.  She is not aware of prior history of MI.  She denies diabetes.  She does have a history of GERD.  She notes feeling depressed at times because of living alone.  She denies rheumatologic conditions including psoriasis or lupus.  Remainder of review of systems is negative times 15 except as described above.,PHYSICAL EXAM:  ,Height 5 feet 0 inches, weight 123 pounds, temperature 99.2 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure has ranged from 160/87 with pulses recorded at being 144, and currently ranges 101/53 to 147/71, pulse 64, respiratory rate 20, O2 saturation 97%.  On general exam, she is a pleasant elderly woman who is hard of hearing, but is alert and interactive.  HEENT:  Shows cranium is  normocephalic and atraumatic.  She has moist mucosal membranes.  Neck veins were not distended.  There are no carotid bruits.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation anteriorly without wheezes.  She is relatively immobile because of her left hip fracture.  Cardiac Exam:  S1, S2, regular rate, frequent ectopic beats, 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, preserved aortic component of the second heart sound.  There is also a soft holosystolic murmur heard.  There is no rub or gallop.  PMI is nondisplaced.  Abdomen is soft and nondistended.  Bowel sounds present.  Extremities without significant clubbing, cyanosis, and there is trivial to 1+ peripheral edema.  Pulses appear grossly intact.  Affect is appropriate.  Visible skin warm and perfused.  She is not able to move because of left hip fracture easily in bed.,DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES/LAB DATA: , Pertinent labs include chest x-ray with radiology report pending but shows only a calcified aortic knob.  No clear pulmonary vascular congestion.  Sodium 140, potassium 3.7, it was 3.1 on admission, chloride 106, bicarbonate 27, BUN 17, creatinine 0.9, glucose 150, magnesium was 2 on 07/13/06.  Troponin was 0.03 followed by 0.18.  INR is 0.93, white blood cell count 10.2, hematocrit 36, platelet count 115,000.,EKGs are reviewed.  Initial EKG done on 08/19/08 at 1832 shows MAT, heart rate of 104 beats per minute, no ischemic changes.  She had a followup EKG done at 20:37 on 08/19/08, which shows wandering atrial pacemaker and some lateral T-wave changes, not significantly changed from prior.  Followup EKG done this morning shows normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs.,IMPRESSION:  ,She is an 84-year-old female with a history of hypertension, severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension and mild aortic stenosis admitted after a fall with left hip fracture and she will require surgery.  Telemetry now reviewed, shows predominantly normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs _____ earlier yesterday evening showed burst of multifocal atrial tachycardia and I suspect that was exacerbated by prior hypokalemia, which has been corrected.  There has been no atrial fibrillation documented.  I do not feel these troponins are significant given the stress or fall in prior multifocal atrial tachycardia with increased rate especially in the absence of chest pain or shortness of breath.  She actually describes feeling good exercise capacity prior to this fall.  Given favorable risk to benefit ratio for needed left hip surgery, I feel she may proceed with needed left hip surgery from a cardiac standpoint with continued verapamil, which has been started, which should help control the multifocal atrial tachycardia, which she had and would watch for heart rate with that.  Continued optimization of electrolytes.  The patient cannot take beta-blockers as previously Toprol reportedly caused shortness of breath, although, there was some report that it caused bradycardia so we would watch her heart rate on the verapamil.  The patient is aware of the cardiac risks, certainly it is moderate, and wishes to proceed with needed surgery.  I do not feel any further cardiac evaluation is needed at this time and the patient may followup with Dr. X after discharge.  Regarding her mild thrombocytopenia, I would defer that to hospitalist and continue proton pump inhibitors for history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, management of left hip fracture as per orthopedist.",1.0

This morning, her BNP was 163 at admission.  Her admission chest x-ray was unremarkable and did not show evidence of cardiomegaly to suggest pericardial effusion.  Her current EKG tracing from 05:42 shows a sinus bradycardia with Wolff-Parkinson White Pattern, a rate of 58 beats per minute, and a corrected QT interval of 557 milliseconds.  Her PR interval was 0.12.,We received a call from Munson Medical Center that a bed had been arranged for the patient.  I contacted Dr. Varner and we reviewed the patient's managed to this point.  All combined impression is that the patient was likely to not have had actual ventricular tachycardia.  This is based on her EP study from October showing her to be non-inducible.  In addition, she had a cardiac catheterization that showed no evidence of coronary artery disease.  What is most likely that the patient has postoperative atrial fibrillation.  Her WPW may have degenerated into a ventricular tachycardia, but this is unlikely.  At this point, we will convert the patient from IV amiodarone to oral amiodarone and obtain an echocardiogram to verify that she does not have evidence of pericardial effusion in the postoperative period.

Symptoms occur three to four times per year and follow no identifiable pattern.  She has put thought and effort in trying to identify precipitating factors or circumstances but has been unable to do so.  Symptoms can last for an hour or more and she feels as if her heart is going very rapidly but has never measured her heart rate.  The last two episodes, the most recent of which was yesterday, were associated with feeling of darkness descending as if a shade was being pulled down in front of her vision.  On neither occasion did she lose consciousness.,Yesterday, she had a modestly active morning taking a walk with her dogs and performing her normal routines.  While working on a computer, she had a spell.  Palpitations persisted for a short time thereafter as outlined in the hospital's admission note prompting her to seek evaluation at the hospital.  She was in sinus rhythm on arrival and has been asymptomatic since.,No history of exogenous substance abuse, alcohol abuse, or caffeine abuse.  She does have a couple of sodas and at least one to two coffees daily.  She is a nonsmoker.  She is a mother of two.  There is no family history of congenital heart disease.

Strong and symmetrical distal pulses.,A 12-lead EKG shows sinus rhythm with normal axis and intervals.  No evidence of preexcitation.,LABORATORY STUDIES: , Unremarkable.  No evidence of myocardial injury.  Thyroid function is pending.,Two-dimensional echocardiogram shows no evidence of clinically significant structural or functional heart disease.,IMPRESSION/PLAN: , Episodic palpitations over a nine-year period.  Outpatient workup would be appropriate.  Event recorder should be obtained and the patient can be seen again in the office upon completion of that study.  Suppressive medication (beta-blocker or Cardizem) was discussed with the patient for symptomatic improvement, though this would be unlikely to be a curative therapy.  The patient expresses a preference to avoid medical therapy if possible.,Thank you for this consultation.  We will be happy to follow her both during this hospitalization and following discharge.  Caffeine avoidance was discussed as well.,ADDENDUM: , During her initial evaluation, a D-dimer was mildly elevated to 5.  CT scan showed no evidence of pulmonary embolus.  Lower extremity venous ultrasound is pending; however, in the absence of embolization to the pulmonary vasculature, this would be an unlikely cause of palpitations.  In addition, no progression over the nine-year period that she has been symptomatic suggests that this is an unlikely cause.,",1.0

177,"PROCEDURE:,  Total hip replacement.,PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:,  The patient was bought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  After induction of anesthesia, the patient was turned on the side and secured in the hip table.  An incision was made, centered over the greater trochanter.  Dissection was sharply carried down through the subcutaneous tissues.  The gluteus maximus was incised and split proximally.  The piriformis and external rotators were identified.  These were removed from their insertions on the greater trochanter as a sleeve with the hip capsule.  The hip was dislocated.  A femoral neck cut was made using the guidance of preoperative templating.  The femoral head was removed.  Extensive degenerative disease was found on the femoral head as well as in the acetabulum.,Baseline leg-length measurements were taken.  The femur was retracted anteriorly and a complete labrectomy was performed.  Reaming of the acetabulum was then performed until adequate bleeding subchondral bone was identified in the key areas.  The trial shell was placed and found to have an excellent fit.  The real shell was opened and impacted into position in the appropriate amount of anteversion and abduction.  Screws were placed by drilling into the pelvis, measuring, and placing the appropriate length screw.  Excellent purchase was obtained.  The trial liner was placed.,The femur was then flexed and internally rotated.  The extra trochanteric bone was removed, as was any leftover lateral soft tissue at the piriformis insertion.  An intramedullary hole was drilled into the femur to define the canal.  Reaming was performed until the appropriate size was reached.  The broaches were then used to prepare the femur with the appropriate amount of version.  Once the appropriate size broach was reached, it was used as a trial with head and neck placement.  Hip range-of-motion was checked in all planes, including flexion-internal rotation, the position of sleep, and extension-external rotation.  The hip was found to have excellent stability with the final chosen head-neck combination.  Leg length measurements were taken and found to be within acceptable range, given the necessity for stability.,The real stem was opened and impacted into position.  The real head was impacted atop the stem.  If cement was used, the canal was thoroughly washed and dried and plugged with a restrictor, and then the cement was injected and pressurized and the stem was implanted in the appropriate version.  Excess cement was removed from the edges of the component.  Range of motion and stability were once again checked and found to be excellent.  Adequate hemostasis was obtained.  Vigorous power irrigation was used to remove all debris from the joint prior to final reduction.,The arthrotomy and rotators were closed using #1 Ethibond through drill holes in the bone, recreating the posterior hip structural anatomy.  The gluteus maximus was repaired using 0 Ethibond and 0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed after further irrigation with 2-0 Vicryl and Monocryl sutures.  The skin was closed with nylon.  Xeroform and a sterile dressing were applied followed by a cold pack and Ace wrap.  The patient was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition, having tolerated the procedure well.",2.0
4106,"PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,  Cataract extraction with lens implantation, right eye.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room.  The patient was identified and the correct operative site was also identified.  A retrobulbar block using 5 ml of 2% lidocaine without epinephrine was done after adequate anesthetic was assured, and the eye was massaged to reduce risk of bleeding.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  A lid speculum was applied.,A groove incision at the 12 o'clock position was made with a 5700 blade.  This was beveled anteriorly in a lamellar fashion using the crescent knife.  Then the anterior chamber was entered with a slit knife.  The chamber was deepened with Viscoat.  Then a paracentesis at the 3 o'clock position was created using a super sharp blade.  A cystitome was used to nick the anterior capsule and then the capsulotomy was completed with capsulorrhexis forceps.  Hydrodissection was employed using BSS on a blunt 27-gauge needle.,The phaco tip was then introduced into the eye, and the eye was divided into 4 grooves.  Then a second instrument was used, a Sinskey hook, to crack these grooves, and the individual quadrants were brought into the central zone and phacoemulsified.  I/A proceeded without difficulty using the irrigation/aspiration cannula.  The capsule was felt to be clear and intact.  The capsular bag was then expanded with ProVisc.,The internal corneal wound was increased using the slit knife.  The lens was inspected and found to be free of defects, folded, and easily inserted into the capsular bag, and unfolded.  A corneal light shield was then used as the wound was sutured with a figure-of-eight 10-0 nylon suture.  Then the Viscoat was removed using I/A, and the suture drawn up and tied.,The 0.2 ml of gentamicin was injected subconjunctivally.  Maxitrol ointment was instilled into the conjunctival sac.  The eye was covered with a double patch and shield, and the patient was discharged.",2.0

Bunionectomy, SCARF type, with metatarsal osteotomy and internal screw fixation, left.,2.  Arthroplasty left second toe.,HISTORY:  ,This 39-year-old female presents to ABCD General Hospital with the above chief complaint.  The patient states that she has had bunion for many months.  It has been progressively getting more painful at this time.  The patient attempted conservative treatment including wider shoe gear without long-term relief of symptoms and desires surgical treatment.,PROCEDURE: , An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preop holding area.  The patient was transported to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position with a safety belt across her lap.  Copious amount of Webril were placed around the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff.  After adequate sedation was achieved by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 15 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected in a Mayo and digital block to the left foot.  The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.  The foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg and the foot was lowered to the operating table.  The stockinette was reflected.  The foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge.  Attention was then directed to the first metatarsophalangeal joint of the left foot.  An incision was created over this area approximately 6 cm in length.  The incision was deepened with a #15 blade.  All vessels encountered were ligated for hemostasis.  The skin and subcutaneous tissue was then dissected from the capsule.  Care was taken to preserve the neurovascular bundle.  Dorsal linear capsular incision was then created.  The capsule was then reflected from the head of the first metatarsal.  Attention was then directed to the first interspace where a lateral release was performed.  A combination of sharp and blunt dissection was performed until the abductor tendons were identified and transected.  A lateral capsulotomy was performed.  Attention was then directed back to the medial eminence where sagittal saw was used to resect the prominent medial eminence.  The incision was then extended proximally with further dissection down to the level of the bone.  Two 0.45 K-wires were then inserted as access guides for the SCARF osteotomy.  A standard SCARF osteotomy was then performed.  The head of the first metatarsal was then translocated laterally in order to reduce the first interspace in the metatarsal angle.  After adequate reduction of the bunion deformity was noted, the bone was temporarily fixated with a 0.45 K-wire.  A 3.0 x 12 mm screw was then inserted in the standard AO fashion with compression noted.  A second 3.0 x 14 mm screw was also inserted with tight compression noted.  The remaining prominent medial eminence medially was then resected with a sagittal saw.  Reciprocating rasps were then used to smooth any sharp bony edges.  The temporary fixation wires were then removed.  The screws were again checked for tightness, which was noted.  Attention was directed to the medial capsule where a medial capsulorrhaphy was performed.  A straight stat was used to assist in removing a portion of the capsule.  The capsule was then reapproximated with #2-0 Vicryl medially.  Dorsal capsule was then reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The subcutaneous closure was performed with #4-0 Vicryl followed by running subcuticular stitch with #5-0 Vicryl.  The skin was then closed with #4-0 nylon in a horizontal mattress type fashion.,Attention was then directed to the left second toe.  A dorsal linear incision was then created over the proximal phalangeal joint of the left second toe.  The incision was deepened with a #15 blade and the skin and subcutaneous tissue was dissected off the capsule to be aligned laterally.  An incision was made on either side of the extensor digitorum longus tendon.  A curved mosquito stat was then used to reflex the tendon laterally.  The joint was identified and the medial collateral ligamentous attachments were resected off the head of the proximal phalanx.  A sagittal saw was then used to resect the head of the proximal head.  The bone was then rolled and the lateral collateral attachments were transected and the bone was removed in toto.  The extensor digitorum longus tendon was inspected and noted to be intact.  Any sharp edges were then smoothed with reciprocating rasp.  The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  The skin was then reapproximated with #4-0 nylon.  Dressings consisted of Owen silk, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban.  Pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and an immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the left foot.  The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications.  The patient was transported to PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the left foot.  The patient is to follow up with Dr. X in his clinic as directed.",2.0

The left deltopectoral and cervical areas were prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Local anesthetic was infiltrated in the area.  There was some evidence that surgical procedure had happened in the area nearby and also there was collateral venous circulation under the skin, which made us suspicious that may be __________, but at any rate I tried to cannulate it subcutaneously and I was unsuccessful.  Therefore, I proceeded to make an incision and was able to isolate the vein, which would look very sclerotic.  I tried to cannulate it, but I could not advance the wire.,At that moment, I decided that there was no way we are going to put a port though that area.  I packed the incision and we prepped and redraped the patient including both groins.  Local anesthetic was infiltrated and then the left femoral vein was percutaneously cannulated without any difficulty.  The introducer was placed and then a wire and then the catheter of the double lumen port, which had been trimmed to position it near the heart.  It was done with radiological guidance.  Again, I was able to position the catheter in the junction of inferior vena cava and right atrium.  The catheter was looked upwards and the double lumen port was inserted subcutaneously towards the iliac area.  The port had been aspirated satisfactorily and irrigated with heparin solution.  The drain incision was closed in layers including subcuticular suture with Monocryl.  Then, we went up to the left shoulder and closed that incision in layers.

This was done under a local and IV sedation via the Anesthesia Department.,HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS:,  This is a 37-year-old African-American male with a mass present at the posterolateral aspect of his right knee.  On aspiration, it was originally attempted to no avail.  There was a long-standing history of this including two different MRIs, one about a year ago and one very recently both of which did not delineate the mass present.  During aspiration previously, the patient had experienced neuritic type symptoms down his calf, which have mostly resolved by the time that this had occurred.  The patient continued to complain of pain and dysfunction to his calf.  This was discussed with him at length.  He wished this to be explored and the mass excised even though knowing the possibility that they would not change his pain pattern with the potential of reoccurrence as well as the potential of scar stiffness, swelling, and peroneal nerve palsy.  With this, he decided to proceed.,Upon observation preoperatively, the patient was noted to have a hard mass present to the posterolateral aspect of the right knee.  It was noted to be tender.  It was marked preoperatively prior to an anesthetic.  Upon dissection, the patient was noted to have significant thickening of the posterior capsule.  The posterolateral aspect of the knee above the posterolateral complex at the gastroc attachment to the lateral femoral condyle.  There was also noted to be prominence of the lateral femoral condyle ridge.  The bifurcation at the tibial and peroneal nerves were identified and no neuroma was present.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was laid supine upon the operating table.  After receiving IV sedation, he was placed prone.  Thigh tourniquet was placed.  He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A transverse incision was carried down across the crease with a mass had been palpated through skin and subcutaneous tissue after exsanguination of the limb and tourniquet utilized.  The nerve was identified and carefully retracted throughout the case.  Both nerves were identified and carefully retracted throughout the case.  There was noted to be no neuroma present.  This was taken down until the gastroc was split.  There was gross thickening of the joint capsule and after arthrotomy, a section of the capsule was excised.  The lateral femoral condyle was then osteophied.  We then smoothed off with a rongeur.  After this, we could not palpate any mass whatsoever placing pressure upon the area of the nerve.  Tourniquet was deflated.  It was checked again.  There was no excessive swelling.  Swanson drain was placed to the depth of the wound and interrupted #2-0 Vicryl was utilized for subcutaneous fat closure and #4-0 nylon was utilized for skin closure.  Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and Webril were placed for compression dressing.  Digits were warm _______ pulses distally at the end of the case.

He was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit.  He was rewarmed and had blood, sputum, and urine cultures done.  He was placed on IV Rocephin.  His usual medications of Dilantin and Depakene were given.  The patient's hypertension was treated with fluid boluses.  The patient was empirically placed on Synthroid and hydrocortisone by Dr. X.  Blood work consisted of a chemistry panel that was unremarkable, except for decreased proteins.  H&H was stable at 33.3/10.9 and platelets of 80,000.  White blood cell counts were normal, differential was normal.  TSH was 3.41.  Free T4 was 0.9.  Dr. X felt this was consistent with secondary hypothyroidism and recommended Synthroid replacement.  A cortisol level was obtained prior to administration of hydrocortisone.  This was 10.9 and that was not a fasting level.  Dr. X felt because of his hypothyroidism and his hypothermia that he had secondary adrenal insufficiency and recommended hydrocortisone and Florinef.  The patient was eventually changed to prednisone 2.5 mg b.i.d. in addition to his Florinef 0.1 mg on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.  The patient was started back on his tube feeds.  He tolerated these poorly with residuals.  Reglan was increased to 10 mg q.6 h. and erythromycin is being added.  The patient's temperature has been stable in the 94 to 95 range.

An ankle tourniquet was placed on the left ankle and the left foot was elevated and Esmarch bandage applied to exsanguinate the foot.  The ankle tourniquet was then inflated to 230 mmHg and then was brought back down to the level of the table.  The stockinette was then cut and reflected and held in place using towel clamp.,The skin was then cleansed using the wet and dry Ray-Tec sponge and then the plantar lesion was outlined.  The lesion measured 1 cm in diameter at the level of the skin and a 3 cm elliptical incision line was drawn on the surface of the skin in the plantolateral aspect of the left fifth digit.  Then using a fresh #15 blade, skin incision was made.  Following this, the incision was then deepened using a fresh #15 blade down to the level of the subcutaneous tissue.  Using a combination of sharp and blunt dissection, the skin was reflected distally and proximally to the lesion.  The lesion appeared well encapsulated with fibrous tissue and through careful dissection using combination of sharp and drill instrumentation the ulceration was removed in its entirety.  The next further exploration was performed to ensure that no residual elements of the fibrous capsular tissue remained within.  The lesion extended from the level of the skin down to the periosteal tissue of the middle and distal phalanx, however, did not show any evidence of extending beyond the level of a periosteum.  Remaining tissues were inspected and appeared healthy.  The lesion was placed in the specimen container and sent to pathology for microanalysis as well as growth.  Attention was then directed to the proximal interphalangeal joint of the left fifth digit and using further dissection with a #15 blade, the periosteum was reflected off the lateral aspect of the proximal ________ median phalanx.  The capsule was also reflected to expose the prominent lateral osseous portion of this joint.  Using a sagittal saw and #139 blade, the lateral osseous prominence was resected.  This was removed in entirety.  Then using power-oscillating rasp, the sharp edges were smoothed and recontoured to the desirable anatomic condition.  Then the incision and wound was flushed using copious amounts of sterile saline with gentamycin.  Following this, the bone was inspected and appeared to be healthy with no evidence of involvement from the removed aforementioned lesion.,Following this, using #4-0 nylon in a combination of horizontal mattress and simple interrupted sutures, the lesion wound was closed and skin was approximated well without tension to the surface skin.  Following this, the incision site was dressed using Owen silk, 4x4s, Kling, and Coban in a normal fashion.  The tourniquet was then deflated and hyperemia was noted to return to digits one through five of the left foot.  The patient was then escorted from the operative table into the Postanesthesia Care Unit.  The patient tolerated the procedure and anesthesia well and was brought to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact.  In the recovery, the patient was given a surgical shoe as well as given instructions for postoperative care to include rest ice and elevation as well as the patient was given prescription for Naprosyn 250 mg to be taken three times daily as well as Vicodin ES to be taken q.6h. as needed.,The patient will follow-up on Friday with Dr. X in office for further evaluation.  The patient was also given instructions as to signs of infection and to monitor her operative site.  The patient was instructed to keep daily dressings intact, clean, dry, and to not remove them.",2.0

Risks and benefits of the surgery including bleeding, infection, neurologic deficit, nonunion, progressive spondylosis, and lack of improvement were all discussed.  He understood and wished to proceed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  Preoperative antibiotics were given.  The patient was placed in the supine position with all pressure points noted and well padded.  The patient was prepped and draped in standard fashion.  An incision was made approximately above the level of the cricoid.  Blunt dissection was used to expose the anterior portion of the spine with carotid moved laterally and trachea and esophagus moved medially.  We then placed needle into the disc spaces and was found to be at C5-C6.  Distracting pins were placed in the body of C4 and in to the body of C6.  The disc was then completely removed at C4-C5.  There was very significant compression of the cord.  This was carefully removed to avoid any type of pressure on the cord.  This was very severe and multiple free fragments were noted.  This was taken down to the level of ligamentum.  Both foramen were then also opened.  Other free fragments were also found behind the body of C5, part of the body of C5 was taken down to assure that all of these were removed.  The exact same procedure was done at C5-C6; however, if there were again free fragments noted, there was less not as severe compression at the C4-C5 area.  Again part of the body at C5 was removed to make sure that there was no additional constriction.  Both nerve roots were then widely decompressed.  Machine bone allograft was placed into the C4-C5 as well as C5-C6 and then a Zephyr plate was placed in the body of C4 and to the body of C6 with a metal pin placed into the body at C5.  Excellent purchase was obtained.  Fluoroscopy showed good placement and meticulous hemostasis was obtained.  Fascia was closed with 3-0 Vicryl, subcuticular 3-0 Dermabond for skin.

The occipital area was shaven bilaterally and then the areas of the prior scalp incisions were infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine after routine prepping and draping.  Both U-shaped scalp incisions were opened exposing both the left and the right ventricular catheters as well as the old low pressure reservoir, which might have been leading to the coaptation of the ventricles.  The patient also had a right subtemporal depression, which was full preoperatively.  The entire old apparatus was dissected out.  We then cut both the ventricular catheters and secured them with sutures so that __________ could be inserted.  They were both inspected.  No definite debris were seen.  After removing the ventricular catheters, the old tracts were inspected and we could see where there was coaptation of the ventricles against the ventricular catheter.  On the right side, we elected to insert the Portnoy ventricular catheter and on the left a new Bactiseal catheter was inserted underneath the corpus callosum in a different location.  The old valve was dissected out and the proGAV valve with a 2-0 shunt assist was inserted and secured with a 2-0 Ethibond suture.  The proGAV valve was then connected to a Bactiseal distal tubing, which was looped in a cephalad way and then curved towards the left burr hole site and then the Portnoy catheter on the right was secured with a right-angled sleeve and then interposed between it and the left burr hole site with a flushing reservoir.  All connections secured with 2-0 Ethibond suture and a small piece of Bactiseal tubing between the flushing reservoir and the connector, which secured the left Bactiseal tubing to the two other Bactiseal tubings one being the distal Bactiseal tubing going towards the proGAV valve, which was set to an opening pressure of 8 and the other one being the Bactiseal tubing, which was going towards the flushing reservoir.,All the wounds were irrigated out with bacitracin and then closed in a routine manner using Vicryl for the deep layers and Monocryl for the skin, followed by Mastisol and Steri-Strips.

Options such as watchful waiting, Kegel exercises, broad-based sling to help with ISD versus Coaptite bulking agents were discussed.  Risks and benefits of all the procedures were discussed.  The patient understood and wanted to proceed with BioArc.  Risk of failure of the procedure, recurrence of incontinence due to urgency, mesh erosion, exposure, etc., were discussed.  Risk of MI, DVT, PE, and bleeding etc., were discussed.  The patient understood the risk of infection and wanted to proceed with the procedure.  The patient was told that due to the intrinsic sphincter deficiency, we will try to make the sling little bit tighter to allow better urethral closure, which may put her a high risk of retention versus if we make it too loose, then she may leak afterwards.,The patient understood and wanted to proceed with the procedure.,DETAILS OF THE OPERATION: , The patient was brought to the OR and anesthesia was applied.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  A Foley catheter was placed.  Bladder was emptied.  Two Allis clamps were placed on the anterior vaginal mucosa.  Lidocaine 1% with epinephrine was applied, and hydrodissection was done.  Incision was made.  A bladder was lifted off of the vaginal mucosa.  The bladder cystocele was reduced.  Two stab incisions were placed on the lateral thigh over the medial aspect of the obturator canal.  Using BioArc needle, the needles were passed through under direct palpation through the vaginal incision from the lateral thigh to the vaginal incision.  The mesh arms were attached and arms were pulled back the outer plastic sheath and the excess mesh was removed.  The mesh was right at the bladder neck to the mid-urethra, completely covering over the entire urethra.,The sling was kept little tight, even though the right angle was easily placed between the urethra and the BioArc material.  The urethra was coapted very nicely.  At the end of the procedure, cystoscopy was done and there was no injury to the bladder.  There was good efflux of urine with indigo carmine coming through from both the ureteral openings.  The urethra was normal, seemed to have closed up very nicely with the repair.  The vaginal mucosa was closed using 0 Vicryl in interrupted fashion.  The lateral thigh incisions were closed using Dermabond.  Please note that the irrigation with antibiotic solution was done prior to the BioArc mesh placement.  The mesh was placed in antibiotic solution prior to the placement in the body.

Revision of distal anastomosis with 7 mm interposition Gore-Tex graft.,ANESTHESIA:,  General with controlled ventillation.,GROSS FINDINGS: , The patient is a 58-year-old black male with chronic renal failure.  He undergoes dialysis through the left forearm bridge fistula and has small pseudoaneurysms at the needle puncture sites level.  There is narrowing at the distal anastomosis due to intimal hypoplasia and the vein beyond it was of good quality.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the OR suite, placed in supine position.  General anesthetic was administered.  Left arm was prepped and draped in appropriate manner.  A Pfannenstiel skin incision was created just below the antecubital crease just deeper to the subcutaneous tissue.  Utilizing both blunt and sharp dissections segment of the fistula was isolated ________ vessel loop.  Transverse graftotomy was created.  A #4 Fogarty catheter passed proximally and distally restoring inflow and meager inflow.  A fistulogram was performed and the above findings were noted.  In a retrograde fashion, the proximal anastomosis was patent.  There was no narrowing within the forearm graft.  Both veins were flushed with heparinized saline and controlled with a vascular clamp.  A longitudinal incision was then created in the upper arm just deep into the subcutaneous tissue fascia.  Utilizing both blunt and sharp dissection, the brachial vein as well as distal anastomosis was isolated.  The distal anastomosis amputated off the fistula and oversewn with continuous running #6-0 Prolene suture tied upon itself.  The vein was controlled with vascular clamps.  Longitudinal venotomy created along the anteromedial wall.  A 7 mm graft was brought on to the field and this was cut to shape and size.  This was sewed to the graft in an end-to-side fashion with U-clips anchoring the graft at the heel and toe with interrupted #6-0 Prolene sutures.  Good backflow bleeding was confirmed.  The vein flushed with heparinized saline and graft was controlled with vascular clamp.  The end of the insertion graft was cut to shape in length and sutured to the graft in an end-to-end fashion with continuous running #6-0 Prolene suture.  Good backflow bleeding was confirmed.  The graftotomy was then closed with interrupted #6-0 Prolene suture.  Flow through the fistula was permitted, a good flow passed.  The wound was copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution.  Sponge, needles, instrument counts were correct.  All surgical sites were inspected.  Good hemostasis was noted.  The incision was closed in layers with absorbable sutures.

There is an afferent pupillary defect on the right.  On examination, there is a right hypertropia.  There is dense anterior chamber inflammation on the right eye with a stagnant aqueous.  There is either neovascularization on the iris or reactive iris vessels, it is difficult to discern.  This seems to be complete iris synechia to the anterior lens capsule.  There is a posterior chamber intraocular lens with an inflammatory debris on the anterior surface.  The anterior chamber appears narrow.  On the left, there is also dense inflammation at 4+ cell.  There is 1+ nuclear sclerosis.  Dilated fundus examination cannot be performed on the right secondary to intense inflammation.  On the left, there is no evidence of active posterior uveitis.  There is some inferior vitreous debris.,ASSESSMENT/PLAN:,  Chronic bilateral recurrent nongranulomatous diffuse uveitis.  Currently, there is very severe right eye inflammation and severe left eye.  I discussed at length with the patient that this will likely take an oral steroid to quite her down.  Since she has only one seeing eye, I am anxious to obtain a decreased inflammation as soon as possible.  She has been on oral steroids in the past.  We also discussed, considering the aggressive recurrent nature of this process, it is likely we will have to consider a steroid sparing agent to maintain longer term control of this recurrent process so that we do not use visual acuity in the left.  I anticipate we will likely start methotrexate in the near future.  In this acute phase, I have recommended oral steroids at a dose of 60 mg a day, hourly topical Pred Forte as well as atropine sulfate.  We will watch her closely in clinic.

Tonsillectomy and resection of soft palate.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,INDICATIONS: , Chris is a very nice 38-year-old male with nasal septal deviation and bilateral inferior turbinate hypertrophy causing nasal obstruction.  He also has persistent tonsillitis with hypertrophy and tonsillolith and halitosis.  He also has developed tremendous edema to his posterior palate and uvula, which is causing choking.  Correction of these mechanical abnormalities is indicated.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient was placed on the operating room table in the supine position.  After adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was administered, the right and left nasal septal mucosa and right and left inferior turbinates were anesthetized with 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine using approximately 10 mL.  Afrin-soaked pledgets were placed in the nasal cavity bilaterally.  The face was prepped with pHisoHex and draped in a sterile fashion.  A hemitransfixion incision was performed on the left with a #15 blade and submucoperichondrial and mucoperiosteal flap was raised with the Cottle elevator.  Anterior to the septal deflection, the septal cartilage was incised and an opposite-sided submucoperichondrial and mucoperiosteal flap was raised with the Cottle elevator.  The deviated portion of the nasal septal cartilage and bone was removed with a Takahashi forceps, and a large inferior septal spur was removed with a V-chisel.  Once the septum was reduced in the midline, the hemitransfixion incision was closed with a 4-0 Vicryl in an interrupted fashion.  The right and left inferior turbinates were trimmed in a submucous fashion using straight and curved turbinate scissors under direct visualization with a 4 mm 0 degree Storz endoscope.  Hemostasis was acquired by using suction electrocautery.  The turbinates were then covered with bacitracin ointment after cauterizing them and bacitracin ointment soaked Doyle splints were placed in the right and left nares and secured anteriorly to the columella with a 3-0 nylon suture.  The table was then turned.  A shoulder roll placed under the shoulders and the face was draped in a clean fashion.  A McIvor mouth gag was applied.  The tongue was retracted and the McIvor was gently suspended from the Mayo stand.  The left tonsil was grasped with a curved Allis forceps, retracted medially, and the anterior tonsillar pillar was incised with Bovie electrocautery.  The tonsil was removed from the superior pole to inferior pole using a Bovie electrocautery in its entirety in a subcapsular fashion.  The right tonsil was grasped in a similar fashion, retracted medially, and the anterior tonsillar pillar was incised with Bovie electrocautery.  The tonsil was removed from the superior pole to inferior pole using Bovie electrocautery in its entirety in a subcapsular fashion.  The inferior, middle, and superior pole vessels were further cauterized with suction electrocautery.  The extremely edematous portion of soft palate was resected using a right angle clamp and right angle scissor and was closed with 3-0 Vicryl in a figure-of-eight interrupted fashion.  Copious saline irrigation of the oral cavity was then performed.  There was no further identifiable bleeding at the termination of the procedure.  The estimated blood loss was less than 10 mL.  The patient was extubated in the operating room, brought to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  There were no intraoperative complications.",2.0

After adequate anesthesia via endotracheal intubation, the nose was prepped with Afrin nasal spray.  After this was done, 1% Xylocaine with 100,000 epinephrine was infiltrated in both sides of the septum and the mucoperichondrium.  After this, the sinus endoscope at 25-degrees was then used to examine the nasal cavity in the left nasal cavity and staying lateral to the middle turbinate.  A 45-degree forceps then used to open up the maxillary sinus.  There was some prominent tissue and just superior to this, the anterior ethmoid was opened.  The 45-degree forceps was then used to open the maxillary sinus ostium.  This was enlarged with backbiting rongeur.  After this was done, the tissue found in the ethmoid and maxillary sinus were removed and sent to pathology and labeled as left maxillary sinus mucosa.  After this was done, attention was then turned to the right nasal cavity staying laterally to the middle turbinate.  There was noted to have prominence in the anterior ethmoidal area.  This was then opened with 45-degree forceps.  This mucosa was then removed from the anterior area.  The maxillary sinus ostium was then opened with 45-degree forceps.  Tissue was removed from this area.  This was sent as right maxillary mucosa.  After this, the backbiting rongeur was then used to open up the ostium and enlarge the ostium on the right maxillary sinus.  Protecting the eyes with wet gauze and using KTP laser at 10 watts, the sinus endoscope was used for observation and the submucosal resection was done of both inferior turbinates as well as anterior portion of the middle turbinates bilaterally.  This was to open up to expose the maxillary ostium as well as other sinus ostium to minimize swelling and obstruction.  After this was completed, a septoplasty was performed.  The incision was made with a #15 blade Bard-Parker knife.  The flap was then elevated, overlying the spur that was protruding into the right nasal cavity.  This was excised with a #15 blade Bard-Parker knife.  The tissue was then laid back in position.  After this was laid back in position, the nasal cavity was irrigated with saline solution, suctioned well as well as the oropharynx.  , ,Surgicel with antibiotic ointment was placed in each nostril and sutured outside the nose with 3-0 nylon.

Left hip arthroscopic femoral neck osteoplasty.,3.  Left hip arthroscopic labral repair.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,OPERATION IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room, where he underwent general anesthetic.  His bilateral lower extremities were placed under traction on the Hana table.  His right leg was placed first.  The traction post was left line, and the left leg was placed in traction.  Sterile Hibiclens and alcohol prep and drape were then undertaken.  A fluoroscopic localization was undertaken.  Gentle traction was applied.  Narrow arthrographic effect was obtained.  Following this, the ProTrac portal was made under the fluoro visualization, and then, a direct anterolateral portal made and a femoral neck portal made under direct visualization.  The diagnostic arthroscopy showed the articular surface to be intact with a moderate anterior lip articular cartilage delamination injury that propagated into the acetabulum.  For this reason, the acetabular articular cartilage was taken down and stabilized.  This necessitated takedown of the anterior lip of the acetabulum and subsequent acetabular osteoplasty debridement with associated labral repair.  The labrum was repaired using absorbable Smith & Nephew anchors with a sliding SMC knot.  After stabilization of the labrum and the acetabulum, the ligamentum teres was assessed and noted to be stable.  The remnant articular surface of the femoral artery and acetabulum was stable.  The posterior leg was stable.  The traction was left half off, and the anterolateral aspect of the head and neck junction was identified.  A stable femoral neck decompression was accomplished starting laterally and proceeding anteriorly.  This terminated with the hip coming out of traction and indeterminable flexion.  A combination of burs and shavers was utilized to perform a stable femoral neck osteoplasty decompression.  The decompression was completed with thorough irrigation of the hip.  The cannula was removed, and the portals were closed using interrupted nylon.  The patient was placed into a sterile bandage and anesthetized intraarticularly with 10 mL of ropivacaine subcutaneously with 20 mL of ropivacaine and at this point was taken to the recovery room.

His bilateral lower extremities were placed under traction on the Hana table.  His right leg was placed first.  The traction post was left line, and the left leg was placed in traction.  Sterile Hibiclens and alcohol prep and drape were then undertaken.  A fluoroscopic localization was undertaken.  Gentle traction was applied.  Narrow arthrographic effect was obtained.  Following this, the ProTrac portal was made under the fluoro visualization, and then, a direct anterolateral portal made and a femoral neck portal made under direct visualization.  The diagnostic arthroscopy showed the articular surface to be intact with a moderate anterior lip articular cartilage delamination injury that propagated into the acetabulum.  For this reason, the acetabular articular cartilage was taken down and stabilized.  This necessitated takedown of the anterior lip of the acetabulum and subsequent acetabular osteoplasty debridement with associated labral repair.  The labrum was repaired using absorbable Smith & Nephew anchors with a sliding SMC knot.  After stabilization of the labrum and the acetabulum, the ligamentum teres was assessed and noted to be stable.  The remnant articular surface of the femoral artery and acetabulum was stable.  The posterior leg was stable.  The traction was left half off, and the anterolateral aspect of the head and neck junction was identified.  A stable femoral neck decompression was accomplished starting laterally and proceeding anteriorly.  This terminated with the hip coming out of traction and indeterminable flexion.  A combination of burs and shavers was utilized to perform a stable femoral neck osteoplasty decompression.  The decompression was completed with thorough irrigation of the hip.  The cannula was removed, and the portals were closed using interrupted nylon.  The patient was placed into a sterile bandage and anesthetized intraarticularly with 10 mL of ropivacaine subcutaneously with 20 mL of ropivacaine and at this point was taken to the recovery room.  He tolerated the procedure very well with no signs of complications.",2.0
945,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Rotator cuff tear, right shoulder.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Superior labrum anterior and posterior lesion (peel-back), right shoulder.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Arthroscopy with arthroscopic SLAP lesion.,2.  Repair of soft tissue subacromial decompression rotator cuff repair, right shoulder.,SPECIFICATIONS: , The entire operative procedure was done in Inpatient Operating Suite, room #1 at ABCD General Hospital.  This was done under a interscalene block anesthetic and subsequent general anesthetic in the modified beachchair position.,HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS:  ,This is a 54-year-old white female suffering an increasing right shoulder pain for a few months prior to surgical intervention.  She had an injury to her right shoulder when she fell off a bike.  She was diagnosed preoperatively with a rotated cuff tear.,Intra-articularly besides we noted a large SLAP lesion, superior and posterior to the attachment of the glenoid labrum from approximately 12:30 back to 10:30.  This acted as a peel-back type of mechanism and was displaced into the joint beyond the superior rim of the glenoid.  This was an obvious avulsion into subchondral bone with bone exposed.  The anterior aspect had degenerative changes, but did not have evidence of avulsion.  The subscapular was noted to be intact.  On the joint side of the supraspinatus, there was noted to be a laminated type of tearing to the rotated cuff to the anterior and mid-aspect of the supraspinatus attachment.,This was confirmed subacromially.  The patient had a type-I plus acromion in outlet view and thus it was elected to not perform a subacromial decompression, but soft tissue release of the CA ligament in a releasing resection type fashion.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was placed supine upon the operative table after she was given interscalene and then general anesthesia by the Anesthesia Department.  She was safely placed in a modified beachchair position.  She was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  The portals were created from outside the ends, posterior to the scope and anteriorly for an intraoperative portal and then laterally.  She had at least two other portals appropriate for both repair mechanisms described above.,Attention was then turned to the SLAP lesion.  The edges were debrided both on the bony side as well as soft tissue side.  We used the anterior portal to lift up the mechanism and created a superolateral portal through the rotator cuff and into the edge of the labrum.  Further debridement was carried out here.  A drill hole was made just on the articular surface superiorly for a knotless anchor.  A pull-through suture of #2 fiber wire was utilized with the ________.  This was pulled through.  It was tied to the leader suture of the knotless anchor.  This was pulled through and one limb of the anchor loop was grabbed and the anchor impacted with a mallet.  There was excellent fixation of the superior labrum.  It was noted to be solid and intact.  The anchor was placed safely in the bone.  There was no room for further knotless or other anchors.  After probing was carried out, hard copy Polaroid was obtained.,Attention was then turned to the articular side for the rotator cuff.  It was debrided.  Subchondral debridement was carried out to the tuberosity also.  Care was taken to go to the subchondral region but not beyond.  The bone was satisfactory.,Scope was then placed in the subacromial region.  Gross bursectomy was carried out with in the lateral portal.  This was done throughout as well as in the gutters anterolaterally and posteriorly.  Debridement was carried out further to the rotator cuff.  Two types of fixation were carried out, one with a superolateral portal a drill hole was made and anchor of the _knotless suture placed after PDS leader suture placed with a Caspari punch.  There was an excellent reduction of the tear posteriorly and then anteriorly.  Tendon to tendon repair was accomplished by placing a fiber wire across the tendon and tying sutured down through the anterolateral portal.  This was done with a sliding stitch and then two half stitches.  There was excellent reduction of the tear.,Attention was then turned to the CA ligament.  It was released along with periosteum and the undersurface of the anterior acromion.  The CA ligament was not only released but resected.  There was noted to be no evidence of significant spurring with only a mostly type-I acromion.  Thus, it was not elected to perform subacromial decompression for bone with soft tissue only.  A pain buster catheter was placed separately.  It was cut to length.  An interrupted #4-0 nylon was utilized for portal closure.  A 0.5% Marcaine was instilled subacromially.  Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and Elastoplast tape placed for dressing.  The patient's arm was placed in a arm sling.  She was transferred to PACU in apparent satisfactory condition.  Expected surgical prognosis on this patient is fair.",2.0

4252,"ATHLETE'S FOOT, TINEA PEDIS,, is a very common fungal skin infection of the foot.  It often first appears between the toes.  It can be a one-time occurrence or it can be chronic.  The fungus, known as Trichophyton, thrives under warm, damp conditions so people whose feet sweat a great deal are more susceptible.  It is easily transmitted in showers and pool walkways.  Those people with immunosuppressive conditions, such as diabetes mellitus, are also more susceptible to athlete's foot.,SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS:,*  Itchy feet.,*  White or red and soft scaling on feet, usually in between toes.,*  Small blisters may be present.,*  Bad foot odor.,*  Very rare involvement of hands and simultaneously (called an Id reaction).,TREATMENT:,*  Diagnosis is via symptoms or sometimes by examining skin scrapings under a microscope..  A bacterial infection may also be suspected in which case a skin culture will confirm this.,*  Try a non-prescription antifungal powder or cream available in drugstores; your doctor can prescribe a stronger topical antifungal medication if necessary.,*  Oral antibiotics may be prescribed for a possible bacterial infection.,*  Keep feet as dry as possible! Change socks twice a day if necessary and wear those made of natural fibers, such as cotton.  Go barefoot when you have a chance or wear sandals.  Dry thoroughly in between toes after swimming or bathing.,*  A special powder to absorb moisture on feet is also available in drugstores.  Ask the pharmacist about this.,*  Spray your shower at home with a 10% bleach solution after bathing.  This may help decrease the chance that other family members will be infected.,*  Wear sandals or thongs in public showers and around pools.,*  Keep in mind that it may take up to a month or more to get rid of your athlete's foot.  Be diligent in using the antifungal medication.  Unfortunately, recurrence of athlete's foot is common.  Luckily, the condition does not cause serious problems for the majority of people who have it.,*  Call the office if your athlete's foot spreads or worsens despite treatment.,PLANTAR FASCIAL STRETCHES,1.  Raise toes toward you while bending your ankle as high as you can.,2.  Hold this position for 15 seconds.,3.  Alternate doing this with the opposite foot 10 times.,4.  Perform this exercise 2- 3 times a day.,WOUND CARE INSTRUCTIONS,1.  Clean the area daily with soap and water.,2.  Every day apply a thin coat of polysporin ointment.,3.  Change the dressing daily and keep the area covered with an adhesive bandage until completely healed.,4.  Notify the office if you have any increasing wound pain or any evidence of infection.",2.0

Also given epinephrine 1:20,000 total of 3 mL.,The patient tolerated the procedure well.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was placed in left lateral decubitus after appropriate sedation.  Digital rectal examination was done, which was normal.  Endoscope was introduced and passed through a rather spastic tortuous sigmoid colon with multiple diverticula seen all the way through transverse colon where about 1 cm x 1 cm sessile polyp was seen.  It was biopsied and then in piecemeal fashion removed using snare polypectomy after base was infiltrated with epinephrine.  Pedunculated polyp next to it was hard to see and there was a lot of peristalsis.  The scope then was advanced through rest of the transverse colon to ascending colon and cecum.  Terminal ileum was briefly reviewed, appeared normal and so did cecum after copious amount of fecal material was irrigated out.  Ascending colon was unremarkable.  At hepatic flexure may be proximal transverse colon, there was a sessile polyp about 1.2 cm x 1 cm that was removed in the same manner with a biopsy taken, base infiltrated with epinephrine and at least two passes of snare polypectomy and subsequent hot biopsy cautery removed to hold polypoid tissue, which could be seen.  In transverse colon on withdrawal and relaxation with epinephrine, an additional 1 mm to 2 mm sessile polyp was removed by hot biopsy.  Then in the transverse colon, additional larger polyp about 1.3 cm x 1.2 cm was removed in piecemeal fashion again with epinephrine, sclerotherapy, and snare polypectomy.  Subsequently pedunculated polyp in distal transverse colon near splenic flexure was removed with snare polypectomy.  The rest of the splenic flexure and descending colon were unremarkable.  Diverticulosis was again seen with almost constant spasm despite of glucagon.  Sigmoid colon did somewhat hinder the inspection of that area.  Rectum, retroflexion posterior anal canal showed internal hemorrhoids moderate to large.  Excess of air insufflated was removed.  The endoscope was withdrawn.,PLAN: , Await biopsy report.

Cystourethroscopy.,2.  Right retrograde pyelogram.,3.  Right ureteral pyeloscopy.,4.  Right renal biopsy.,5.  Right double-J 4.5 x 26 mm ureteral stent placement.,ANESTHESIA: , Sedation.,SPECIMEN: , Urine for cytology and culture sensitivity, right renal pelvis urine for cytology, and right upper pole biopsies.,INDICATION:,  The patient is a 74-year-old male who was initially seen in the office with hematuria.  He was then brought to the hospital for other medical problems and found to still have hematuria.  He has a CAT scan with abnormal appearing right kidney and it was felt that he will benefit from cystoscope evaluation.,PROCEDURE: ,After consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  He was given IV sedation and placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  He was then prepped and draped in the standard fashion.  A #21 French cystoscope was then passed through his ureter on which patient was noted to have a hypospadias and passed through across the ends of the bladder.  The patient was noted to have mildly enlarged prostate, however, it was non-obstructing.,Upon visualization of the bladder, the patient was noted to have some tuberculation to the bladder.  There were no masses or any other abnormalities noted other than the tuberculation.  Attention was then turned to the right ureteral orifice and an open-end of the catheter was then passed into the right ureteral orifice.  A retrograde pyelogram was performed.  Upon visualization, there was no visualization of the upper collecting system on the right side.  At this point, a guidewire was then passed through the open-end of the ureteral catheter and the catheter was removed.  The bladder was drained and the cystoscope was removed.  The rigid ureteroscope was then passed into the bladder and into the right ureteral orifice with the assistance of a second glidewire.  The ureteroscope was taken all the way through the proximal ureter just below the UPJ and there were noted to be no gross abnormalities.  The ureteroscope was removed and an Amplatz wire then passed through the scope up into the collecting system along the side of the previous wire.  The ureteroscope was removed and a ureteral dilating sheath was passed over the Amplatz wire into the right ureter under fluoroscopic guidance.  The Amplatz wire was then removed and the flexible ureteroscope was passed through the sheath into the ureter.  The ureteroscope was passed up to the UPJ at which point there was noted to be difficulty entering the ureter due to UPJ obstruction.  The wire was then again passed through the flexible scope and the flexible scope was removed.  A balloon dilator was then passed over the wire and the UPJ was dilated with balloon dilation.  The dilator was then removed and again the cystoscope was passed back up into the right ureter and was able to enter the collecting system.  Upon visualization of the collecting system of the upper portion, there was noted to be papillary mass within the collecting system.  The ________ biopsy forceps were then passed through the scope and two biopsies were taken of the papillary mass.  Once this was done, the wire was left in place and the ureteroscope was removed.  The cystoscope was then placed back into the bladder and a 26 x 4.5 mm ureteral stent was passed over the wire under fluoroscopic and cystoscopic guidance into the right renal pelvis.  The stent was noted to be clear within the right renal pelvis as well as in the bladder.  The bladder was drained and the cystoscope was removed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  He will be transferred to the recovery room and back to his room.  It has been discussed with his primary physician that the patient will likely need a nephrectomy.  He will be scheduled for an echocardiogram tomorrow and then decision will be made where the patient will be stable for possible nephrectomy on Wednesday.",2.0
2169,"SUBJECTIVE:  ,This patient presents to the office today for a checkup.  He has several things to go over and discuss.  First he is sick.  He has been sick for a month intermittently, but over the last couple of weeks it is worse.  He is having a lot of yellow phlegm when he coughs.  It feels likes it is in his chest.  He has been taking Allegra-D intermittently, but he is almost out and he needs a refill.  The second problem, his foot continues to breakout.  It seems like it was getting a lot better and now it is bad again.  He was diagnosed with tinea pedis previously, but he is about out of the Nizoral cream.  I see that he is starting to breakout again now that the weather is warmer and I think that is probably not a coincidence.  He works in the flint and it is really hot where he works and it has been quite humid lately.  The third problem is that he has a wart or a spot that he thinks is a wart on the right middle finger.  He is interested in getting that frozen today.  Apparently, he tells me I froze a previous wart on him in the past and it went away.  Next, he is interested in getting some blood test done.  He specifically mentions the blood test for his prostate, which I informed him is called the PSA.  He is 50 years old now.  He will also be getting his cholesterol checked again because he has a history of high cholesterol.  He made a big difference in his cholesterol by quitting smoking, but unfortunately after taking his social history today he tells me that he is back to smoking.  He says it is difficult to quit.  He tells me he did quit chewing tobacco.  I told him to keep trying to quit smoking.  ,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  General:  With this illness he has had no problems with fever.  HEENT:  Some runny nose, more runny nose than congestion.  Respiratory:  Denies shortness of breath.  Skin:  He has a peeling skin on the bottom of his feet, mostly the right foot that he is talking about today.  At times it is itchy.,OBJECTIVE: , His weight is 238.4 pounds, blood pressure 128/74, temperature 97.8, pulse 80, and respirations 16.  General exam:  The patient is nontoxic and in no acute distress.  Ears:  Tympanic membranes pearly gray bilaterally.  Mouth:  No erythema, ulcers, vesicles, or exudate noted.  Neck is supple.  No lymphadenopathy.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation.  No rales, rhonchi, or wheezing.  Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmur.  Extremities:  No edema, cyanosis, or clubbing.  Skin exam:  I checked out the bottom of his right foot.  He has peeling skin visible consistent with tinea pedis.  On the anterior aspect of the right third finger there is a small little raised up area that I believe represents a wart.  The size of this wart is approximately 3 mm in diameter.,ASSESSMENT:  ,1.  Upper respiratory tract infection, persistent.,2.  Tinea pedis.,3.  Wart on the finger.,4.  Hyperlipidemia.,5.  Tobacco abuse.,PLAN: , The patient is getting a refill on Allegra-D.  I am giving him a refill on the Nizoral 2% cream that he should use to the foot area twice a day.  I gave him instructions on how to keep the foot clean and dry because I think the reason we are dealing with this persistent problem is the fact that his feet are hot and sweaty a lot because of his work.  His wart has been present for some time now and he would like to get it frozen.  I offered him the liquid nitrogen treatment and he did agree to it.  I used liquid nitrogen after a verbal consent was obtained from the patient to freeze the wart.  He tolerated the procedure very well.  I froze it once and I allowed for a 3 mm freeze zone.  I gave him verbal wound care instructions after the procedure.  Lastly, when he is fasting I am going to send him to the lab with a slip, which I gave him today for a basic metabolic profile, CBC, fasting lipid profile, and a screening PSA test.  Lastly, for the upper respiratory tract infection, I am giving him amoxicillin 500 mg three times a day for 10 days.",1.0

No white cells and 0-2 red cells.,Chest x-ray suboptimal in quality, but without obvious infiltrates, consolidation or pneumothorax.,CRITICAL CARE NOTE:,  Critical care one hour.,Shortly after the patient’s initial assessment, the patient apparently began to complain of chest pain and appeared to the nurse to have mounting exhaustion and respiratory distress. Although O2 had been placed, elevating his oxygen saturations to the mid to upper 90s, he continued to complain of symptoms, as noted above. He became progressively more rapidly obtunded. The patient did receive one gram of magnesium sulfate shortly after his arrival, and the BiPAP apparatus was being readied for his use. However, the patient, at this point, became unresponsive, unable to answer questions, and preparations were begun for intubation. The BiPAP apparatus was briefly placed while supplies and medications were assembled for intubation. It was noted that even with the BiPAP apparatus, in the duration of time which was required for transfer of oxygen tubing to the BiPAP mask, the patient’s O2 saturations rapidly dropped to the upper 60 range.,All preparations for intubation having been undertaken, Succinylcholine was ordered, but was apparently unavailable in the department. As the patient was quite obtunded, and while the Dacuronium was being sought, an initial trial of intubation was carried out using a straight blade and a cupped 7.9 endotracheal tube. However, the patient had enough residual muscle tension to make this impractical and further efforts were held pending administration of Dacuronium 10 mg. After approximately two minutes, another attempt at intubation was successful. The cords were noted to be covered with purulent exudates at the time of intubation.,The endotracheal tube, having been placed atraumatically, the patient was initially then nebulated on 100% oxygen, and his O2 saturations rapidly rose to the 90-100% range.,Chest x-ray demonstrated proper placement of the tube. The patient was given 1 mg of Versed, with decrease of his pulse from the 140-180 range to the 120 range, with satisfactory maintenance of his blood pressure.,Because of a complaint of chest pain, which I myself did not hear, during the patient’s initial triage elevation, a trial of Tridil was begun. As the patient’s pressures held in the slightly elevated range, it was possible to push this to 30 mcg per minute. However, after administration of the Dacuronium and Versed, the patient’s blood pressure fell somewhat, and this medication was discontinued when the systolic pressure briefly reached 98.,Because of concern regarding pneumonia or sepsis, the patient received one gram of Rocephin intravenously shortly after the intubation. A nasogastric and Foley were placed, and an arterial blood gas was drawn by respiratory therapy. Dr. X was contacted at this point regarding further orders as the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit to be placed on the ventilator there. The doctor’s call was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit so he could leave appropriate orders for the patient in addition to my initial orders, which included Albuterol or Atrovent q. 2h. and Levaquin 500 mg IV, as well as Solu-Medrol.,Critical care note terminates at this time.,EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:,  See the critical care note.,MEDICAL DECISION MAKING (DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS):,  This patient has an acute severe decompensation with respiratory failure. Given the patient’s white count and recent history of pneumonia, the possibility of recurrence of pneumonia is certainly there. Similarly, it would be difficult to rule out sepsis. Myocardial infarction cannot be excluded.,COORDINATION OF CARE:,  Dr. X was contacted from the emergency room and asked to assume the patient’s care in the Intensive Care Unit.,FINAL DIAGNOSIS:,  Respiratory failure secondary to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:, The patient is to be transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for further management.",1.0

He was given Ativan for this, and then began to identify a large component measuring about 3 x 3 cm of the right frontal lobe, what appeared to be a hemorrhagic conversion of potential venous infarct.  I had a long discussion immediately with Dr. X and Dr. Y.  We decided to take the patient immediately as a level 1 for evacuation of this hematoma with a small amount of a midline shift with an intraventricular component.  It worried me and I think that we needed to go ahead and take him to the operating room immediately.  The patient was taken as a level 1 immediately and emergently and into the operating room for this procedure.  The original plan was to do first a right-sided orbitozygomatic procedure and then stage it a few weeks later with an endonasal endoscopic procedure for resection of this pituitary tumor component.  He was taken to the operating room for evacuation of a right frontal intraparenchymal hematoma.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS:,  Pituitary tumor with a large intracranial component, status post resection and now development of an intracranial hemorrhage.,POSTOP DIAGNOSIS:,  Intracranial hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe with extension into the intraventricular space after resection of a pituitary tumor via orbitozygomatic approach.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room.  In the supine position, his head was put in a horseshoe without any complications.  The patient tolerated this very well, and the prior incision was immediately opened.  The surgery had taken place a few hours prior to this, the original orbitozygomatic approach.  At this point, this was a life-saving procedure.  We went ahead, opened the old incision after everything was sterilely prepped, and all the surgical instrumentation was brought into place.  We went ahead and opened the incision and took out the pterional bone flap without any complications.  We immediately opened the dura expeditiously, and the brain was moderately under some pressure, but not really bulging out.  So I went ahead and identified an area over the right frontal lobe that was a little bit consistent with a hemorrhagic infarct and nonviable tissue.  So we went ahead and did a corticectomy right there and identified the actual clot immediately and went ahead, and over the next few hours, very meticulously began to evacuate these clots without any complication whatsoever.  We went all the way down to the ventricle and identified this clot in the ventricle and went ahead and removed this clot without any complications, and we had a very nice resection.  The brain was very relaxed.  We had a very good resection of the actual blood clot, and the brain was very relaxed.  We irrigated thoroughly.  We identified the ventricles.  We went ahead and did a very careful hemostasis with Avitene with thrombin and Gelfoam with thrombin over the next times in doing the procedure.  All this was done very well, and then we lined the cavity with Surgicel, and the Surgicel was only put at the edge and draping down as to not to leave any fragments potentially to communicate with the actual ventricle, and then after this, everything was good.  We went ahead and closed back the actual dura back.  We had done a pericranial flap.  This was also put back in place and the dura was closed with 4-0 Surgilons.  We reconstructed everything.  The frontal sinus was reconstructed thoroughly without any complications.  We went ahead and put once again a watertight closure and went ahead and put another piece of DuraGen with Hemaseel in place, and went ahead and put the bone flap back and reconstructed very nicely once again with self-tapping, self-drilling screws, low-profile plates.  Once everything was confirmed to be in place, we went ahead and closed the muscle flap and also the actual fat pad was put back into place and closed together with 0 pop-offs, and the skin with staples without any complications.  In summary, the procedure was going back to the operating room for evacuation of a right-sided intracranial hemorrhage, most likely a conversion of an intraparenchymal hematoma with extension into the ventricle without any complications.  So everything was stable.  Estimated blood loss was about 100 cubic centimeters.  The sponges and needle counts were correct.  No specimens were sent to pathology.,DISPOSITION: , The patient after this procedure was brought to the Neuro Intensive Care Unit for close observation.",1.0

The mass demonstrates inhomogeneous enhancement with contrast.,COURSE:, Head of bed elevated to 30 degrees, Mannitol and DPH were continued. MRI of Brain demonstrated a large right parietal mass with necrotic appearing center and leftward shift of midline structures. She underwent surgical resection of the tumor. Pathological analysis was consistent with adenocarcinoma. GYN exam, CT Abdomen and Pelvis, Bone scan were unremarkable. CXR revealed an right upper lobe lung nodule. She did not undergo thoracic biopsy due to poor condition. She received 3000 cGy cranial XRT in ten fractions and following this was discharged to a rehabilitation center.,In March, 1993 the patient exhibited right ptosis, poor adduction and abduction OD, 4/4 strength in the upper extremities and 5-/5- strength in the lower extremities. She was ambulatory with an ataxic gait.,She was admitted on 7/12/93 for lower cervical and upper thoracic pain, paraparesis and T8 sensory level. MRI brainstem/spine on that day revealed decreased T1 signal in the C2, C3, C6 vertebral bodies, increased T2 signal in the anterior medulla, and tectum, and spinal cord (C7-T3). Following injection of Gadolinium there was diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement from C7-T7 These findings were felt consistent with metastatic disease including possible leptomeningeal spread.

She was diagnosed with displaced left subcapital hip fracture, now was asked to consult.  With this diagnosis, she was indicated the above-noted procedure.  This procedure as well as alternatives to this procedure was discussed at length with the patient and her son, who has the power of attorney, and they understood them well.,Risks and benefits were also discussed.  Risks include bleeding, infection, damage to blood vessels, damage to nerves, risk of further surgery, chronic pain, restricted range of motion, risk of continued discomfort, risk of malunion, risk of nonunion, risk of need for further reconstructive procedures, risk of need for altered activities and altered gait, risk of blood clots, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and risk of death were discussed.  She understood these well and consented, and the son signed the consent for the procedure as described.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was placed on the operating table and general anesthesia was achieved.  The patient was then placed in fracture boots and manipulated under fluoroscopic control until we could obtain near anatomic alignment.  External positions were felt to be present.  At this point, the left hip and left lower extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A guidewire was then placed percutaneously into the tip of the greater trochanter and a small incision was made overlying the guidewire.  An overlying drill was inserted to the proper depths.  A Synthes 11 x 130 degrees trochanteric fixation that was chosen was placed into the intramedullary canal to the proper depth.  Proper rotation was obtained and the guide for the helical blade was inserted.  A small incision was made for this as well.  A guidewire was inserted and felt to be in proper position, in the posterior aspect of the femoral head, lateral, and the center position on AP.  This placed the proper depths and lengths better.  The outer cortex was enlarged and an 85-mm helical blade was attached to the proper depths and proper fixation was done.  Appropriate size screw was then tightened down.  At this point, a distal guide was then placed and drilled across both the cortices.  Length was better.  Appropriate size screw was then inserted.  Proper size and fit of the distal screw was also noted.  At this point, on fluoroscopic control, it was confirming in AP and lateral direction.  We did a near anatomical alignment to the fracture site and all hardware was properly fixed.  Proper size and fit was noted.  Excellent bony approximation was noted.  At this point, both wounds were thoroughly irrigated, hemostasis confirmed, and closure was then begun.,The fascial layers were then reapproximated using #1 Vicryl in a figure-of-eight manner, the subcutaneous tissues were reapproximated in layers using #1 and 2-0 Vicryl sutures, and the skin was reapproximated with staples.  The area was then infiltrated with a mixture of a 0.25% Marcaine with Epinephrine and 1% plain lidocaine.  Sterile dressing was then applied.  No complication was encountered throughout the procedure.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The patient was taken to the recovery room in stable condition.",2.0

After general anesthesia was achieved by the anesthesia team, the above-mentioned anesthetic mixture was infiltrated directly into the patient's left foot to anesthetize the future surgical sites.  The left ankle was covered with cast padding and an 18-inch ankle tourniquet was placed around the left ankle and set at 250 mmHg.  The left foot was then prepped, scrubbed, and draped in normal sterile technique.  The left ankle tourniquet was then inflated.  Attention was then directed on the dorsal aspect of the first left metatarsal shaft where an 8-cm linear incision was placed directly parallel and medial to the course of the extensor hallucis longus tendon.  The incision extended from the base of the first left metatarsal all the way to the first left metatarsophalangeal joint.  The incision was deepened through subcutaneous tissues.  All the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped, and cauterized.  The incision was deepened to the level of the periosteum of the first left metatarsal.  All the tendinous neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved.  Using sharp and dull dissection, the periosteal tissues were mobilized from their attachments on the first left metatarsal shaft.  Dissection was carried down to the level of the lose screw fixation and the two screws were identified and removed intact.  The screws were sent to pathology for examination.  The nonunion was also identified closer to the base of the first left metatarsal and using the sagittal saw the nonunion and some of the healthy tissue on both ends of the previous osteotomy were resected and sent to pathology for identification.  The remaining two ends of the previous osteotomy were then fenestrated with the use of a 0.045 Kirschner wire to induce bleeding.  The corticocancellous bone graft was prepped according to the instructions in saline for at least 60 minutes and then interposed in the previous area of the osteotomy.  Provisional fixation with K-wires was achieved and also correction of the bunion deformity of the first left metatarsophalangeal joint was also accomplished.  The bone graft was then stabilized with the use of a T-type prebent plate with the use of fixed screws that were inserted using AO technique through the plate and the shaft of the first left metatarsal and compressed appropriately the graft.  Removal of the K-wires and examination of fixation and graft incorporation into the previous nonunion area was found to be excellent.  The area was flushed copiously flushed with saline.  The periosteal and capsular tissues were approximated with 3-0 Vicryl and 2-0 Vicryl suture material.  All the subcutaneous tissues were approximated with 4-0 Vicryl suture material and 5-0 Prolene was used to approximate the skin edges at this time.  The left ankle tourniquet was deflated.  Immediate hyperemia was noted to the entire left lower extremity upon deflation of the cuff.  The patient's incision was covered with Xeroform, copious amounts of fluff and Kling, stockinette, and Ace bandage.  The patient's left foot was placed in a surgical shoe.,The patient was then transferred to the postanesthesia care unit with his vital signs stable and the vascular status at appropriate levels.  The patient was given specific instructions and education on how to continue caring for his left foot surgery.  The patient was also given pain medications, instructions on how to control his postoperative pain.  The patient was eventually discharged from Hospital according to nursing protocol and was advised to follow up with Dr. X's office in one week's time for his first postoperative appointment.",2.0

2647,"REASON FOR VISIT:,  The patient presents for a followup for history of erythema nodosum.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , This is a 25-year-old woman who is attending psychology classes.  She was diagnosed with presumptive erythema nodosum in 2004 based on a biopsy consistent with erythema nodosum, but not entirely specific back in Netherlands.  At that point, she had undergone workup which was extensive for secondary diseases associated with erythema nodosum.  Part of her workup included a colonoscopy.  The findings were equivocal characterizes not clearly abnormal biopsies of the terminal ileum.,The skin biopsy, in particular, mentions some fibrosis, basal proliferation, and inflammatory cells in the subcutis.,Prior to the onset of her erythema nodosum, she had a tibia-fibula fracture several years before on the right, which was not temporarily associated with the skin lesions, which are present in both legs anyway.  Even, a jaw cosmetic surgery she underwent was long before she started developing her skin lesions.  She was seen in our clinic and by Dermatology on several occasions.  Apart from the first couple of visits when she presented stating a recurrent skin rash with a description suggestive of erythema nodosum in the lower extremities and ankle and there is discomfort pointing towards a possible inflammatory arthritis and an initial high sed rate of above 110 with an increased CRP.  In the following visits, no evident abnormality has been detected.  In the first visit, here some MTP discomfort detected.  It was thought that erythema nodosum may be present.  However, the evaluation of Dermatology did not concur and it was thought that the patient had venous stasis, which could be related to her prior fracture.  When she was initially seen here, a suspicion of IBD, sarcoid inflammatory arthropathy, and lupus was raised.  She had an equivocal rheumatoid fracture, but her CCP was negative.  She had an ANA, which was positive at 1:40 with a speckled pattern persistently, but the rest of the lupus serologies including double-stranded DNA, RNP, Smith, Ro, La were negative.  Her cardiolipin panel antibodies were negative as well.  We followed the IgM, IgG, and IgA being less than 10.  However, she did have a beta-2 glycoprotein 1 or an RVVT tested and this may be important since she has a livedo pattern.  It was thought that the onset of lupus may be the case.  It was thought that rheumatoid arthritis could not be the case since it is not associated with erythema nodosum.  For the fear of possible lymphoma, she underwent CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  It was done also in order to rule out sarcoid and the result was unremarkable.  Based on some changes in her bowel habits and evidence of B12 deficiency with a high methylmalonic and high homocystine levels along with a low normal B12 in addition to iron studies consistent with iron deficiency and an initially low MCV, the possibility of inflammatory bowel disease was employed.  The patient underwent an initially unrevealing colonoscopy and a capsule endoscopy, which was normal.  A second colonoscopy was done recently and microscopically no evidence of inflammatory bowel disease was seen.  However, eosinophil aggregations were noted in microscopy and this was told to be consistent with an allergic reaction or an emerging Crohn disease and I will need to discuss with Gastroenterology what is the significance of that.  Her possible B12 deficiency and iron deficiency were never addressed during her stay here in the United States.,In the initial appointment, she was placed on prednisone 40 mg, which was gradually titrated down this led to an exacerbation of her acne.  We decided to take her off prednisone due to adverse effects and start her on colchicine 0.6 mg daily.  While this kept things under control with the inflammatory markers being positive and no overt episodes of erythema nodosum, the patient still complains for sensitivity with less suspicious skin rash in the lower extremities and occasional ankle swelling and pain.  She was reevaluated by Dermatology for that and no evidence of erythema nodosum was felt to be present.  Out plan was to proceed with a DEXA scan, at some point check a vitamin D level, and order vitamin D and calcium over the counter for bone protection purposes.  However, the later was deferred until we have resolved the situation and find out what is the underlying cause of her disease.,Her past medical history apart from the tibia-fibular fracture and the jaw cosmetic surgery is significant for varicella and mononucleosis.,Her physical examination had shown consistently diffuse periarticular ankle edema and also venous stasis changes at least until I took over her care last August.  I have not been able to detect any erythema nodosum, however, a livedo pattern has been detected consistently.  She also has evidence of acne, which does not seem to be present at the moment.  She also was found to have a heart murmur present and we are going to proceed with an echocardiogram placed.,Her workup during the initial appointment included an ACE level, which was normal.  She also had a rather higher sed rate up to 30, but prior to that, per report, it was even higher, above 110.  Her RVVT was normal, her rheumatoid factor was negative.  Her ANA was 1:40, speckled pattern.  The double-stranded DNA was negative.  Her RNP and Smith were negative as well.  RO and LA were negative and cardiolipin antibodies were negative as well.  A urinalysis at the moment was completely normal.  A CRP was 2.3 in the initial appointment, which was high.  A CCP was negative.  Her CBC had shown microcytosis and hypochromia with a hematocrit of 37.7.  This improved later without any evidence of hypochromia, microcytosis or anemia with a hematocrit of 40.3.,The patient returns here today, as I mentioned, complaining of milder bouts of skin rash, which she calls erythema nodosum, which is accompanied by arthralgias, especially in the ankles.  I am mentioning here that photosensitivity rash was mentioned in the past.  She tells me that she had it twice back in Europe after skiing where her whole face was swollen.  Her acne has been very stable after she was taken off prednisone and was started on colchicine 0.6 daily.  Today we discussed about the effect of colchicine on a possible pregnancy.,MEDICATIONS: , Prednisone was stopped.  Vitamin D and calcium over the counter, we need to verify that.  Colchicine 0.6 mg daily which we are going to stop, ranitidine 150 mg as needed, which she does not take frequently.,FINDINGS:,  On physical examination, she is very pleasant, alert, and oriented x 3 and not in any acute distress.  There is some evidence of faint subcutaneous lesions in both shins bilaterally, but with mild tenderness, but no evidence of classic erythema nodosum.  Stasis dermatitis changes in both lower extremities present.  Mild livedo reticularis is present as well.,There is some periarticular ankle edema as well.  Laboratory data from 04/23/07, show a normal complete metabolic profile with a creatinine of 0.7, a CBC with a white count of 7880, hematocrit of 40.3, and platelets of 228.  Her microcytosis and hypochromia has resolved.  Her serum electrophoresis does not show a monoclonal abnormality.  Her vitamin D levels were 26, which suggests some mild insufficiency and she would probably benefit by vitamin D supplementation.  This points again towards some ileum pathology.  Her ANCA B and C were negative.  Her PF3 and MPO were unremarkable.  Her endomysial antibodies were negative.  Her sed rate at this time were 19.  The highest has been 30, but prior to her appointment here was even higher.  Her ANA continues to be positive with a titer of 1:40, speckled pattern.  Her double-stranded DNA is negative.  Her serum immunofixation confirmed the absence of monoclonal abnormality.  Her urine immunofixation was not performed.  Her IgG, IgA, and IgM levels are normal.  Her IgE levels are normal as well.  A urinalysis was not performed this time.  Her CRP is 0.4.  Her tissue transglutaminase antibodies are negative.  Her ASCA is normal and anti-OmpC was not tested.  Gliadin antibodies IgA is 12, which is in the borderline to be considered equivocal, but these are nonspecific.  I am reminding here that her homocystine levels have been 15.7, slightly higher, and that her methylmalonic acid was 385, which is obviously abnormal.  Her B12 levels were 216, which is rather low possibly indicating a B12 deficiency.  Her iron studies showed a ferritin of 15, a saturation of 9%, and an iron of 30.  Her TIBC was 345 pointing towards an iron deficiency anemia.  I am reminding you that her ACE levels in the past were normal and that she has a microcytosis.  Her radiologic workup including a thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic CT did not show any suspicious adenopathy, but only small aortocaval and periaortic nodes, the largest being 8 mm in short axis, likely reactive.  Her pelvic ultrasound showed normal uterus adnexa.  Her bladder was normal as well.  Subcentimeter inguinal nodes were found.  There was no large lytic or sclerotic lesion noted.  Her recent endoscopy was unremarkable, but the microscopy showed some eosinophil aggregation, which may be pointing towards allergy or an evolving Crohn disease.  Her capsule endoscopy was limited secondary to rapid transit.  There was only a tiny mucosal red spot in the proximal jejunum without active bleeding, 2 possible erosions were seen in the distal jejunum and proximal ileum.  However, no significant inflammation or bleeding was seen and this could be small bowel crisis.  Neither evidence of bleeding or inflammation were seen as well.  Specifically, the terminal ileum appeared normal.  Recent evaluation by a dermatologist did not verify the presence of erythema nodosum.,ASSESSMENT:,  This is a 25-year-old woman diagnosed with presumptive erythema nodosum in 2004.  She has been treated with prednisone as in the beginning she had also a wrist and ankle discomfort and high inflammatory markers.  Since I took over her care, I have not seen a clear-cut erythema nodosum being present.  No evidence of synovitis was there.  Her serologies apart from an ANA of 1:40 were negative.  She has a livedo pattern, which has been worrisome.  The issue here was a possibility of inflammatory bowel disease based on deficiency in vitamin B12 as indicated by high methylmalonic and homocystine levels and also iron deficiency.  She also has low vitamin D levels, which point towards terminal ileum pathology as well and she had a history of decreased MCV.  We never received the x-ray of her hands which she had and she never had a DEXA scan.  Lymphoma has been ruled out and we believe that inflammatory bowel disease, after repeated colonoscopies and the capsule endoscopy, has been ruled out as well.  Sarcoid is probably not the case since the patient did not have any lymphadenopathies and her ACE levels were normal.  We are going check a PPD to rule out tuberculosis.  We are going to order an RVVT and glycoprotein beta-1 levels in her workup to make sure that an antiphospholipid syndrome is not present given the livedo pattern.  An anti-intrinsic factor will be added as well.  Her primary care physician needs to workup the possible B12 and iron deficiency and also the vitamin D deficiency.  In the meanwhile, we feel that the patient should stop taking the colchicine and if she has a flare of her disease then she should present to her dermatologist and have the skin biopsy performed in order to have a clear-cut answer of what is the nature of this skin rash.  Regarding her heart murmur, we are going to proceed with an echocardiogram.  A PPD should be placed as well.  In her next appointment, we may fax a requisition for vitamin B replacement.,PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES:,  1.  Recurrent erythema nodosum with ankle and wrist discomfort, ? arthritis.,2.  Iron deficiencies, according to iron studies.,3.  Borderline B12 with increased methylmalonic acid and homocystine.,4.  On chronic steroids; vitamin D and calcium is needed; she needs a DEXA scan.,5.  Typical ANCA, per records, were not verified here.  ANCA and ASCA were negative and the OmpC was not ordered.,6.  Acne.,7.  Recurrent arthralgia not present.  Rheumatoid factor, CCP negative, ANA 1:40 speckled.,8.  Livedo reticularis, beta 2-glycoprotein was not checked, we are going to check it today.  Needs vaccination for influenza and pneumonia.,9.  Vitamin D deficiency.  She needs replacement with ergocalciferol, but this may point towards ___________ pathology as this was not detected.,10.  Recurrent ankle discomfort which necessitates ankle x-rays.,PLANS:,  We can proceed with part of her workup here in clinic, PPD, echocardiogram, ankle x-rays, and anti-intrinsic factor antibodies.  We can start repleting her vitamin D with __________ weeks of ergocalciferol 50,000 weekly.  We can add an RVVT and glycoprotein to her workup in order to rule out any antiphospholipid syndrome.  She should be taking vitamin D and calcium after the completion of vitamin D replacement.  She should be seen by her primary care physician, have the iron and B12 deficiency worked up.  She should stop the colchicine and if the skin lesion recurs then she should be seen by her dermatologist.  Based on the physical examination, we do not suspect that the patient has the presence of any other disease associated with erythema nodosum.  We are going to add an amylase and lipase to evaluate her pancreatic function, RPR, HIV, __________ serologies.  Given the evidence of possible malabsorption it may be significant to proceed with an upper endoscopy to rule out Whipple disease or celiac disease which can sometimes be associated with erythema nodosum.  An anti-intrinsic factor would be added, as I mentioned.  I doubt whether the patient has Behcet disease given the absence of oral or genital ulcers.  She does not give a history of oral contraceptives or medications that could be related to erythema nodosum.  She does not have any evidence of lupus __________ mycosis.  Histoplasmosis coccidioidomycosis would be accompanied by other symptoms.  Hodgkin disease has probably been ruled out with a CAT scan.  However, we are going to add an LDH in future workup.  I need to discuss with her primary care physician regarding the need for workup of her vitamin B12 deficiency and also with her gastroenterologist regarding the need for an upper endoscopy.

The FDS had a partial ulnar slip laceration and the FDP had a 25% transverse laceration as well.  The radial neurovascular bundle was found to be completely intact.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  All bony prominences were adequately padded.  Tourniquet was placed on the right upper extremity after being packed with Webril, but not inflated at this time.  The right upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The hand was inspected.  Palmar surface revealed approximally 0.5 cm laceration at the base of the right ring finger at the base of proximal phalanx, which was approximated with nylon suture.  The sutures were removed and the wound was explored.  It was found that the ulnar digital neurovascular bundle was 100% transected.  The radial neurovascular bundle on the right ring finger was found to be completely intact.  We explored the flexor tendon and found that there was a partial laceration of the ulnar slip of the FDS and a 25% laceration in a transverse fashion to the FDP.  We copiously irrigated the wound.  Repair was undertaken of the FDS with #3-0 undyed Ethibond suture.  The laceration of the FDP was not felt that it need to repair due to majority of the substance in the FDP was still intact.  Attention during our repair at the flexor tendon, the A1 pulley was incised for better visualization as well as better tendon excursion after repair.  Attention was then drawn to the ulnar digital bundle which has been transected prior during the injury.  The digital nerve was dissected proximally and distally to likely visualize the nerve.  The nerve was then approximated using microvascular technique with #8-0 nylon suture.  The hands were well approximated.  The nerve was not under undue tension.  The wound was then copiously irrigated and the skin was closed with #4-0 nylon interrupted horizontal mattress alternating with simple suture.  Sterile dressing was placed and a dorsal extension Box splint was placed.  The patient was transferred off of the bed and placed back on a gurney and taken to PACU in stable condition.  Overall prognosis is good.",2.0

She does have known critical carotid artery stenosis.  She wishes to undergo bilateral carotid endarterectomy, however, it was felt necessary by Dr. X to perform cardiac catheterization.  She was admitted to the hospital yesterday with chest pain.  She has been considered for coronary artery bypass grafting.  I have been asked to address the carotid stenosis, left being more severe, this was addressed first.  Intraoperatively, an atherosclerotic plaque was noted in the common carotid artery extending into the internal carotid artery.  The internal carotid artery is quite torturous.  The external carotid artery was occluded at its origin.  When the endarterectomy was performed, the external carotid artery back-bled nicely.  The internal carotid artery had good backflow bleeding noted.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the OR suite and placed in the supine position.  Then neck, shoulder, and chest wall were prepped and draped in appropriate manner.  Longitudinal incision was created along the anterior border of the left sternocleidal mastoid muscle and this was taken through the subcutaneous tissue and platysmal muscle utilizing electrocautery.,Utilizing both blunt and sharp dissections, the common carotid artery, the internal carotid artery beyond the atherosclerotic back, the external carotid artery, and the superior thyroid artery were isolated and encircled with a umbilical tape.  During the dissection, facial veins were ligated with #4-0 silk ligature prior to dividing them.  Also during the dissection, ansa cervicalis, hypoglossal, and vagus nerve identified and preserved.  There was some inflammation above the carotid bulb, but this was not problematic.,The patient had been administered 5000 units of aqueous heparin after allowing adequate circulating time.  The internal carotid artery is controlled with Heifitz clip followed by the external carotid artery and the superior thyroid artery being controlled with Heifitz clips.  The common carotid artery was controlled with profunda clamp.  The patient remained neurologically intact.  A longitudinal arteriotomy was created along the posterior lateral border of the common carotid artery.  This was extended across the lobe on to the internal carotid artery.  An endarterectomy was then performed.  The ________ intima was cleared of all debris and the ________ was flushed with copious amounts of heparinized saline.  As mentioned before, the internal carotid artery is quite torturous.  This was shortened by imbricating the internal carotid artery with horizontal mattress stitches of #7-0 Prolene suture.,The wound was copiously irrigated, rather an endovascular patch was then brought on to the field.  This was cut to shape and length.  This was sutured in place with continuous running #6-0 Prolene suture.  The suture line began at both sites.  The suture was tied in the center along the anterior and posterior walls.  Prior to completing the closure, the common carotid artery was flushed.  The internal carotid artery permitted to back bleed.  The clamp was placed after completing the closure.  The clamp was placed at the origin of the internal carotid artery.  Flow was first directed into the external carotid artery then into the internal carotid artery.  The patient remained neurologically intact.  Topical ________ Gelfoam was utilized.  Of note, during the endarterectomy, the patient did receive an additional 7000 units of aqueous heparin.  The wound was copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution.  Sponge, needle, and all counts were correct.  All surgical sites were inspected.  Good hemostasis noted.  The incision was closed in layers with absorbable suture.  Stainless steel staples approximated skin.  Sterile dressings were applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, grossly neurologically intact.",1.0

She was placed in the supine position.  The area was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion.  After adequate IV sedation was obtained by anesthesia, esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed.  The esophagus, stomach, and duodenum were visualized without difficulty.  There was no gross evidence of any malignancy.  There was some enterogastritis which was noted upon exam.  The appropriate location was noted on the anterior wall of the stomach.  This area was localized externally with 1% lidocaine.  Large gauge needle was used to enter the lumen of the stomach under visualization.  A guide wire was then passed again under visualization and the needle was subsequently removed.  A scalpel was used to make a small incision, next to the guidewire and ensuring that the underlying fascia was nicked as well.  A dilator with break-away sheath was then inserted over the guidewire and under direct visualization was seen to enter the lumen of the stomach without difficulty.  The guidewire and dilator were then removed again under visualization and the PEG tube was placed through the break-away sheath and visualized within the lumen of the stomach.  The balloon was then insufflated and the break-away sheath was then pulled away.  Proper placement of the tube was ensured through visualization with a scope.  The tube was then sutured into place using nylon suture.  Appropriate sterile dressing was applied.,DISPOSITION:  ,The patient was transferred to the recovery in a stable condition.

They all consented for the procedure, and the consent was signed and placed on the chart.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to cardiac cath lab where she was monitored throughout all procedure.  The area of the left pectoral deltoid and subclavian area was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual manner.  We also scrubbed for approximately eight minutes.  Using lidocaine with epinephrine, the area of the left pectoral deltoid region and subclavian area was then fully anesthetized.  Using an #18 gauge Cook needle, the left subclavian vein was cannulated at two separate sites without difficulty, where two separate guidewires were inserted into the left subclavian vein.  The Cook needles were removed.  Then the guidewires were secured in place with hemostat.  Using a #10 and #15 scalpel blade, a 5 cm horizontal incision was made in the left pectodeltoid groove, where the skin was dissected and blunted on to the pectoralis major muscle.  The skin was then undermined making a pocket for the generator.  The guidewires were then tunneled through the performed pocket.  Subsequently, the atrial and ventricular leads were inserted through each one of the Cordis separately and respectively.  Initially, the ventricular lead was inserted, where a Cordis sheath was placed and the guidewire was removed.  After the thresholds and appropriate position was obtained for the ventricular lead, the Cordis sheath was then inserted for the atrial lead.  After the atrial lead was inserted and appropriately placed and thresholds were obtained, the Cordis was removed and then both leads were sutured in place with pectoralis major muscle with #1-0 silk suture.  The leads were then connected to a pulse generator.  The pocket was then irrigated and cleansed, where then the leads and the generators were inserted into that pocket.  The subcutaneous tissue was then closed with gut sutures and the skin was then closed with #4-0 polychrome sutures using a subcuticular uninterrupted technique.  The area was then cleansed and dry.

After induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, the McIvor mouth gag was placed in the oral cavity and a tongue depressor applied.  Two #12-French red rubber Robinson catheters were placed, 1 in each nasal passage, and brought out through the oral cavity and clamped over a dental gauze roll placed on the upper lip to provide soft palate retraction.,Attention was directed to the nasopharynx.  With the Bovie set at 50 coag and the suction Bovie tip on the suction hose, the adenoid bed was fulgurated by beginning at the posterosuperior aspect of the nasopharynx at the apex of the choana placing the tip of the suction cautery deep at the root of the adenoids next to the roof of the nasopharynx and then in a linear fashion making serial passages through the base of the adenoid fossa in parallel lines until the entire nasopharynx and adenoid bed had been fulgurated moving from posterior to anterior.  The McIvor was relaxed and attention was then directed to the ears.,The left external auditory canal was examined under the operating microscope and cleaned of ceruminous debris.,An anteroinferior quadrant tympanostomy incision was made.  Fluid was suctioned from the middle ear space, and a tympanostomy tube was placed at the level of the incision and pushed into position with the Rosen needle.

Anterior spine fusion from T11-L3.,2.  Posterior spine fusion from T3-L5.,3.  Posterior spine segmental instrumentation from T3-L5, placement of morcellized autograft and allograft.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 500 mL.,FINDINGS: , The patient was found to have a severe scoliosis.  This was found to be moderately corrected.  Hardware was found to be in good positions on AP and lateral projections using fluoroscopy.,INDICATIONS: , The patient has a history of severe neurogenic scoliosis.  He was indicated for anterior and posterior spinal fusion to allow for correction of the curvature as well as prevention of further progression.  Risks and benefits were discussed at length with the family over many visits.  They wished to proceed.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position.  General anesthesia was induced without incident.  He was given a weight-adjusted dose of antibiotics.  Appropriate lines were then placed.  He had a neuromonitoring performed as well.,He was then initially placed in the lateral decubitus position with his left side down and right side up.  An oblique incision was then made over the flank overlying the 10th rib.  Underlying soft tissues were incised down at the skin incision.  The rib was then identified and subperiosteal dissection was performed.  The rib was then removed and used for autograft placement later.,The underlying pleura was then split longitudinally.  This allowed for entry into the pleural space.  The lung was then packed superiorly with wet lap.  The diaphragm was then identified and this was split to allow for access to the thoracolumbar spine.,Once the spine was achieved, subperiosteal dissection was performed over the visualized vertebral bodies.  This required cauterization of the segmental vessels.  Once the subperiosteal dissection was performed to the posterior and anterior extents possible, the diskectomies were performed.  These were performed from T11-L3.  This was over 5 levels.  Disks and endplates were then removed.  Once this was performed, morcellized rib autograft was placed into the spaces.  The table had been previously bent to allow for easier access of the spine.  This was then straightened to allow for compression and some correction of the curvature.,The diaphragm was then repaired as was the pleura overlying the thoracic cavity.  The ribs were held together with #1 Vicryl sutures.  Muscle layers were then repaired using a running #2-0 PDS sutures and the skin was closed using running inverted #2-0 PDS suture as well.  Skin was closed as needed with running #4-0 Monocryl.  This was dressed with Xeroform dry sterile dressings and tape.,The patient was then rotated into a prone position.  The spine was prepped and draped in a standard fashion.,Longitudinal incision was made from T2-L5.  The underlying soft tissues were incised down at the skin incision.  Electrocautery was then used to maintain hemostasis.  The spinous processes were then identified and the overlying apophyses were split.  This allowed for subperiosteal dissection over the spinous processes, lamina, facet joints, and transverse processes.  Once this was completed, the C-arm was brought in, which allowed for easy placement of screws in the lumbar spine.  These were placed at L4 and L5.  The interspaces between the spinous processes were then cleared of soft tissue and ligamentum flavum.  This was done using a rongeur as well as a Kerrison rongeur.  Spinous processes were then harvested for morcellized autograft.,Once all the interspaces were prepared, Songer wires were then passed.  These were placed from L3-T3.,Once the wires were placed, a unit rod was then positioned.  This was secured initially at the screws distally on both the left and right side.  The wires were then tightened in sequence from the superior extent to the inferior extent, first on the left-sided spine where I was operating and then on the right side spine.  This allowed for excellent correction of the scoliotic curvature.,Decortication was then performed and placement of a morcellized autograft and allograft was then performed after thoroughly irrigating the wound with 4 liters of normal saline mixed with bacitracin.  This was done using pulsed lavage.,The wound was then closed in layers.  The deep fascia was closed using running #1 PDS suture, subcutaneous tissue was closed using running inverted #2-0 PDS suture, the skin was closed using #4-0 Monocryl as needed.  The wound was then dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform dry sterile dressings, and tape.  The patient was awakened from anesthesia and taken to the intensive care unit in stable condition.  All instrument, sponge, and needle counts were correct at the end of the case.,The patient will be managed in the ICU and then on the floor as indicated.",2.0

The patient was found by the 8-year-old sister in the bathroom.  He was laying down on one side, and he was crying and moaning.  The sibling went and told the parents.  The parents rushed to the bathroom, they found him crying, and he was not moving the left side of his body.  He was initially alert, but his alertness diminished.  They decided to take him to the emergency room in Hospital, where a CT was done on his head, which showed a 4 x 4 x 2.5 cm bleed.  The emergency physician called our emergency room, and I decided to involve Neurosurgery, Mr. X, the physician assistant, who is on call for the Neurosurgery Services.  Collectively, they have made arrangements with the ICU attendings to have the child transported to our emergency room.  For a small stop, I am obtaining an MRI and then admitting to the ICU.

They decided to give him a dose of IV mannitol.  I ordered his labs, type and cross.  CBC is 15.6 white blood cell count, hemoglobin 12.8.  PT/PTT were ordered due to the bleed, which was seen intracerebrally.  They were 13.1 and 24.5 respectively.  Blood gas, I-STAT pH 7.36, pCO2 is 51.  This was a venous specimen.  The ICU attendings decided to do a rapid sequence intubation.  This was done in our emergency room by Dr. Y and Dr. Z.

The risks of the procedure were explained.  She was taken to the operating room and given perioperative antibiotics prior to coming to the surgery.  General anesthesia was carried out without difficulty and a Foley catheter was inserted.  The left arm was tucked and the abdomen was prepped with Betadine and draped in sterile fashion.  A 5-mm blunt port was inserted infra-umbilically at the level of the umbilicus under direct vision of a 5-mm 0-degree laparoscope.  Once we were inside the abdominal cavity, CO2 was instilled to attain an adequate pneumoperitoneum.  A left lower quadrant 5-mm port was placed under direct vision and a 12-mm port in the suprapubic region.  The 5-mm scope was introduced at the umbilical port and the appendix was easily visualized.  The base of the cecum was acutely inflamed but not perforated.  I then was easily able to grasp the mesoappendix and create a window between the base of the mesoappendix and the base of the appendix.  The window is big enough to get an Endo GIA blue cartridge through it and fired across the base of the mesoappendix without difficulty.  I reloaded with a red vascular cartridge, came across the mesoappendix without difficulty.  I then placed the appendix in an Endobag and brought out through the suprapubic port without difficulty.  I reinserted the suprapubic port and irrigated out the right lower quadrant until dry.  One final inspection revealed no bleeding from the staple line.  We then removed all ports under direct vision, and there was no bleeding from the abdominal trocar sites.  The pneumoperitoneum was then deflated and the suprapubic fascial defect was closed with 0-Vicryl suture.  The skin incision was injected with 0.25% Marcaine and closed with 4-0 Monocryl suture.  Steri-strips and sterile dressings were applied.  No complications.  Minimal blood loss.  Specimen is the appendix.  Brought to the recovery room in stable condition.",2.0

The patient is very difficult to obtain information from; however, he appears to be having frequent nausea and vomiting with an aspiration pneumonia and abdominal discomfort.  In addition, this hospitalization, he has undergone an upper endoscopy, which found a small ulcer after dropping his hematocrit and becoming anemic.  He had a CT scan on Friday, 11/02/07, which apparently showed pneumatosis and his cecum worrisome for ischemic colitis as well as bilateral hydronephrosis and multiple liver lesions, which could be metastatic disease versus cysts.  In discussions with the patient, he had multiple bowel movements yesterday and is currently passing flatus and has epigastric pain.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,Obtained from the medical chart.

He does appear to have tenderness but does not have rebound and does not have peritoneal signs.,DIAGNOSTICS: , A CT scan done on 11/02/07 shows pneumatosis in the cecum with an enlarged cecum filled with stool and air fluid levels with chronically dilated small bowel.,ASSESSMENT: , Possible ischemic cecum with possible metastatic disease, bilateral hydronephrosis on atrial fibrillation, aspiration pneumonia, chronic alcohol abuse, acute renal failure, COPD, anemia with gastric ulcer.,PLAN: , The patient appears to have pneumatosis from a CT scan 2 days ago.  Nothing was done about it at that time as the patient appeared to not be symptomatic, but he continues to have nausea and vomiting with abdominal pain, but the fact that pneumatosis was found 2 days ago and the patient has survived this long indicates this may be a benign process at the moment, and I would recommend getting a repeat CT scan to assess it further to see if there is worsening of pneumatosis versus resolution to further evaluate the liver lesions and make decisions regarding planning at that time.  The patient has frequent desaturations secondary to his aspiration pneumonia, and any surgical procedure or any surgical intervention would certainly require intubation, which would then necessitate long-term ventilator care as he is not someone who would be able to come off of a ventilator very well in his current state.  So we will look at the CT scan and make decisions based on the findings as far as that is concerned.",1.0

She was afebrile.  She was taken by Dr. X to the operating room.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , The patient underwent a procedure.  She tolerated without difficulty.  She had her pain controlled with p.o. pain medicine.  She was afebrile.  She is tolerating liquid diet.  It was felt that the patient is stable for discharge.  She did complain of bladder spasms when she urinated and she did say that she has a history of chronic UTIs.  We will check a UA and urine culture prior to discharge.  I will give her prescription for ciprofloxacin that she can take for 3 days presumptively and I have discharged her home with omeprazole and Colace to take over-the-counter for constipation and we will send her home with Percocet for pain.  Her labs were within normal limits.  She did have an elevated white blood cell count, but I believe this is just leukemoid reaction, but she is afebrile, and if she does have UTI, may also be related.  Her labs in terms of her bilirubin were within normal limits.  Her LFTs were slightly elevated, I do believe this is related to the cautery used on the liver bed.  They were 51 and 83 for the AST and ALT respectively.  I feel that she looks good for discharge.,DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: , Clear liquid diet x48 hours and she can return to her Medifast, she may shower.  She needs to keep her wound clean and dry.  She is not to engage in any heavy lifting greater than 10 pounds x2 weeks.  No driving for 1 to 2 weeks.  She must be able to stop in an emergency and be off narcotic meds, no strenuous activity, but she needs to maintain mobility.  She can resume her medications per med rec sheets.,DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: , As previously mentioned.,FOLLOWUP:,  We will follow up on both urinalysis and cultures.  She is instructed to follow up with Dr. X in 2 weeks.  She needs to call for any shortness of breath, temperature greater than 101.5, chest pain, intractable nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, any redness, swelling or foul smelling drainage from her wounds.",1.0
314,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Osteomyelitis, right hallux.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Osteomyelitis, right hallux.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,  Amputation distal phalanx and partial proximal phalanx, right hallux.,ANESTHESIA:,  TIVA/local.,HISTORY:,  This 44-year-old male patient was admitted to ABCD General Hospital on 09/02/2003 with a diagnosis of osteomyelitis of the right hallux and cellulitis of the right lower extremity.  The patient has a history of diabetes and has had a chronic ulceration to the right hallux and has been on outpatient antibiotics, which he failed.  The patient after a multiple conservative treatments such as wound care antibiotics, the patient was given the option of amputation as a treatment for the chronic resistant osteomyelitis.  The patient desires to attempt a surgical correction.  The risks versus benefits of the procedure were discussed with the patient in detail by Dr. X.  The consent was available on the chart for review.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After patient was taken to the operating room via cart and placed on the operating table in the supine position, a safety strap was placed across his waist.  Adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department of Anesthesia and a total of 3.5 cc of 1:1 mixture 1% lidocaine and 0.5% Marcaine plain were injected into the right hallux as a digital block.  The foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion lowering the operative field.,Attention was directed to the hallux where there was a full-thickness ulceration to the distal tip of the hallux measuring 0.5 cm x 0.5 cm.  There was a ________ tract, which probed through the distal phalanx and along the sides of the proximal phalanx laterally.  The toe was 2.5 times to the normal size.  There were superficial ulcerations in the medial arch of both feet secondary to history of a burn, which were not infected.  The patient had dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses that were found to be +2/4 bilaterally preoperatively.  X-ray revealed complete distraction of the distal phalanx and questionable distraction of the lateral aspect of the proximal phalanx.  A #10 blade was used to make an incision down the bone in a transverse fashion just proximal to the head of the proximal phalanx.  The incision was carried mediolaterally and plantarly encompassing the toe leaving a large amount of plantar skin intact.  Next, the distal phalanx was disarticulated at the interphalangeal joint and removed.  The distal toe was amputated and sent to laboratory for bone culture and sensitivity as well as tissue pathology.  Next, the head of the proximal phalanx was inspected and found to be soft on the distal lateral portion as suspected.  Therefore, a sagittal saw was used to resect approximately 0.75 cm of the distal aspect of head of the proximal phalanx.  This bone was also sent off for culture and was labeled proximal margin.  Next, the flexor hallucis longus tendon was identified and retracted as far as possible distally and transected.  The flexor tendon distally was gray discolored and was not viable.  A hemostat was used to inspect the flexor sheath to ensure no infection tracking up the sheath proximally.  None was found.  No purulent drainage or abscess was found.  The proximal margin of the surgical site tissue was viable and healthy.  There was no malodor.  Anaerobic and aerobic cultures were taken and passed this as a specimen to microbiology.  Next, copious amounts of gentamicin and impregnated saline were instilled into the wound.,A #3-0 Vicryl was used to reapproximate the deep subcutaneous layer to release skin tension.  The plantar flap was viable and was debulked with Metzenbaum scissors.  The flap was folded dorsally and reapproximated carefully with #3-0 nylon with a combination of simple interrupted and vertical mattress sutures.  Iris scissors were used to modify and remodel the plantar flap.  An excellent cosmetic result was achieved.  No tourniquet was used in this case.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and surgery without apparent complications.  A standard postoperative dressing was applied consisting of saline-soaked Owen silk, 4x4s, Kerlix, and Coban.  The patient was transported via cart to Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs able and vascular status intact to right foot.  He will be readmitted to Dr. Katzman where we will continue to monitor his blood pressure and regulate his medications.  Plan is to continue the antibiotics until further IV recommendations.,He will be nonweightbearing to the right foot and use crutches.  He will elevate his right foot and rest the foot, keep it clean and dry.  He is to follow up with Dr. X on Monday or Tuesday of next week.",1.0

She reports a rotational sensation upon arising from the bed or chair that lasts for several minutes and requires her to sit back down and stay in one place.  She gets similar symptoms when she rolls over in bed.  She is not able to describe what direction she feels like she is spinning.  At times, she also feels as though she is going to pass out.  These sensations stop if she just sits in one place or lies down for several minutes.  She does note that it is worse when she turns to the right and when she turns to the left.  She also complains that she gets similar sensations when she looks up.  She denies any recent fever, chills, earache, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, other change in vision, or recent new headaches.

Weight is 257 pounds.  Pain scale is 7.,GENERAL:  This is a somewhat anxious elderly African-American female who tends to amplify findings on examination.  It is a difficult examination due to the fact that no matter where the patient was touched she would wince in pain and withdraw.  She is obese.,HEENT:  She is normocephalic and atraumatic.  Conjunctivae and sclerae are clear.  Tympanic membranes were visualized bilaterally.  There is tenderness to palpation of any sinus region.  There are no palpable cervical nodes.,NECK:  Supple although she complains of pain when rotating her neck.,CHEST:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.,HEART:  Heart sounds are distant.

Brief inspection of her eyes failed to show any nystagmus at that time.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN:,  This is a 77-year-old African-American female with multiple medical problems who presents with episodic positionally related dizziness of unclear etiology.  Most certainly there is significant exaggeration of the underlying problem and her neurological examination is compounded by much functional overlay, limiting the interpretation of my findings.  I suspect this is just a mild benign positional vertigo, although I cannot rule out vertebrobasilar compromise.  I agree with symptomatic treatment with Antivert.,We will schedule her for CT of head, CT angiogram to evaluate for possible brain stroke and vertebrobasilar insufficiency.  In addition, we will attempt to get further objective data by ENG testing.  I will see the patient again after these tests are completed and she has a trial of the Antivert.",1.0

Upon transfer, he had a right pleural effusion demonstrated on x-ray as well as some shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion.  The risks, benefits, and alternatives to right VATS pleurodesis and pleural biopsy were discussed with the patient and his family and they wished to proceed.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed in supine position.  A double-lumen endotracheal tube was placed.  SCDs were also placed and he was given preoperative Kefzol.  The patient was then brought into the right side up, left decubitus position, and the area was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  A needle was inserted in the axillary line to determine position of the effusion.  At this time, a 10-mm port was placed using the knife and Bovie cautery.  The effusion was drained by placing a sucker into this port site.  Upon feeling the surface of the pleura, there were multiple firm nodules.  An additional anterior port was then placed in similar fashion.  The effusion was then drained with a sucker.  Multiple pleural biopsies were taken with the biopsy device in all areas of the pleura.  Of note, feeling the diaphragmatic surface, it appeared that it was quite nodular, but these nodules felt as though they were on the other side of the diaphragm and not on the pleural surface of the diaphragm concerning for a possibly metastatic disease.  This will be worked up with further imaging study later in his hospitalization.  After the effusion had been drained, 2 cans of talc pleurodesis aerosol were used to cover the lung and pleural surface with talc.  The lungs were then inflated and noted to inflate well.  A 32 curved chest tube chest tube was placed and secured with nylon.  The other port site was closed at the level of the fascia with 2-0 Vicryl and then 4-0 Monocryl for the skin.  The patient was then brought in the supine position and extubated and brought to recovery room in stable condition.,Dr. X was present for the entire procedure which was right VATS pleurodesis and pleural biopsies.,The counts were correct x2 at the end of the case.",1.0

2348,"PROCEDURE:, Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with brush cytology and biopsy.,INDICATION FOR THE PROCEDURE:, Patient with a history of chronic abdominal pain and CT showing evidence of chronic pancreatitis, with a recent upper endoscopy showing an abnormal-appearing ampulla.,MEDICATIONS:, General anesthesia.,The risks of the procedure were made aware to the patient and consisted of medication reaction, bleeding, perforation, aspiration, and post ERCP pancreatitis.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: ,After informed consent and appropriate sedation, the duodenoscope was inserted into the oropharynx, down the esophagus, and into the stomach. The scope was then advanced through the pylorus to the ampulla. The ampulla had a markedly abnormal appearance, as it was enlarged and very prominent. It extended outward with an almost polypoid shape. It had what appeared to be adenomatous-appearing mucosa on the tip. There also was ulceration noted on the tip of this ampulla. The biliary and pancreatic orifices were identified. This was located not at the tip of the ampulla, but rather more towards the base. Cannulation was performed with a Wilson-Cooke TriTome sphincterotome with easy cannulation of the biliary tree. The common bile duct was mildly dilated, measuring approximately 12 mm. The intrahepatic ducts were minimally dilated. There were no filling defects identified. There was felt to be a possible stricture within the distal common bile duct, but this likely represented an anatomic variant given the abnormal shape of the ampulla. The patient has no evidence of obstruction based on lab work and clinically. Nevertheless, it was decided to proceed with brush cytology of this segment. This was done without any complications. There was adequate drainage of the biliary tree noted throughout the procedure. Multiple efforts were made to access the pancreatic ductal anatomy; however, because of the shape of the ampulla, this was unsuccessful. Efforts were made to proceed in a long scope position, but still were unsuccessful. Next, biopsies were obtained of the ampulla away from the biliary orifice. Four biopsies were taken. There was some minor oozing which had ceased by the end of the procedure. The stomach was then decompressed and the endoscope was withdrawn.,FINDINGS:,1. Abnormal papilla with bulging, polypoid appearance, and looks adenomatous with ulceration on the tip; biopsies taken.,2. Cholangiogram reveals mildly dilated common bile duct measuring 12 mm and possible distal CBD stricture, although I think this is likely an anatomic variant; brush cytology obtained.,3. Unable to access the pancreatic duct.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,1. NPO except ice chips today.,2. Will proceed with MRCP to better delineate pancreatic ductal anatomy.,3. Follow up biopsies and cytology.",2.0
894,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Tailor's bunion, right foot.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  ,Tailor's bunion, right foot.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Removal of bone, right fifth metatarsal head.,ANESTHESIA:  ,TIVA/local.,HISTORY: , This 60-year-old male presents to ABCD Preoperative Holding Area after keeping himself n.p.o., since mid night for surgery on his painful right Tailor's bunion.  The patient has a history of chronic ulceration to the right foot which has been treated on an outpatient basis with conservative methods Dr. X.  At this time, he desires surgical correction as the ulcer has been refractory to conservative treatment.  Incidentally, the ulcer is noninfective and practically healed at this date.  The consent is available on the chart for review and Dr. X has discussed the risks versus benefits of this procedure to the patient in detail.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room, placed on the operating table in supine position and a safety strap was placed across his waist for his protection.  A pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied about the right foot over copious amount of Webril for the patient's protection.  After adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 10 cc of 1:1 mixture of 1% lidocaine and 0.5% Marcaine plain were administered into the right fifth metatarsal using a Mayo type block technique.  Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion.  An Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the foot and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was lowered in the operating field and a sterile stockinet was reflected.  The Betadine was cleansed with saline-soaked gauze and dried.  Anesthesia was tested with a one tooth pickup and found to be adequate.  A #10 blade was used to make 3.5 cm linear incision over the fifth metatarsophalangeal joint.  A #15 blade was used to deepen the incision to the subcutaneous layer.  Care was taken to retract the extensor digitorum longus tendon medially and the abductor digiti minimi tendon laterally.  Using a combination of sharp and blunt dissection, the medial and lateral edges of the wound were undermined down to the level of the capsule and deep fascia.  A linear capsular incision was made with a #15 blade down to the bone.  The capsular periosteal tissues were elevated off the bone with a #15 blade.  Metatarsal head was delivered into the wound.  There was hypertrophic exostosis noted laterally as well as a large bursa in the subcuteneous tissue layer.  The ulcer on the skin was approximately 2 x 2 mm, it was partial skin thickness and did not probe.  A sagittal saw was used to resect the hypertrophic lateral eminence.  The hypertrophic bone was split in half and one half was sent to Pathology and the other half was sent to Microbiology for culture and sensitivity.  Next, a reciprocating rasp was used to smoothen all bony surfaces.  The bone stock had an excellent healthy appearance and did not appear to be infected.  Copious amount of sterile gentamicin impregnated saline were used to flush the wound.  The capsuloperiosteal tissues were reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl in simple interrupted technique.  The subcutaneous layer was closed with #4-0 Vicryl in simple interrupted technique.  Next, the skin was closed with #4-0 nylon in a horizontal mattress suture technique.  A standard postoperative dressing was applied consisting of Betadine-soaked Owen silk, 4x4s, Kerlix, and Kling.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted at the digits.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.  He was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the right foot.  He was given a postop shoe and will be full weightbearing.  He has prescription already at home for hydrocodone and does not need to refill.  He is to follow up with Dr. X and was given emergency contact numbers.  He was discharged in stable condition.",2.0

Note, she refused her CMF adjuvant therapy and this was for a triple-negative infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the breast.  Patient has been following with Dr. Diener and Dr. Wilmot.  I believe that genetic counseling had been recommended to her and obviously the CMF was recommended, but she declined both.  She presented to the office with left axillary adenopathy in view of the high-risk nature of her lesion.  I recommended that she have this lymph node removed.  The procedure, purpose, risk, expected benefits, potential complications, alternative forms of therapy were discussed with her and she was agreeable to surgery.,TECHNIQUE: , Patient was identified, then taken into the operating room where after induction of appropriate anesthesia, her left chest, neck, axilla, and arm were prepped with Betadine solution, draped in a sterile fashion.  An incision was made at the hairline, carried down by sharp dissection through the clavipectoral fascia.  I was able to easily palpate the lymph node and grasp it with a figure-of-eight 2-0 silk suture and by sharp dissection, was carried to hemoclip all attached structures.  The lymph node was excised in its entirety.  The wound was irrigated.  The lymph node sent to pathology.  The wound was then closed.  Hemostasis was assured and the patient was taken to recovery room in stable condition.",2.0

Moderate stenosis C5-6.,OPERATION: , On 06/25/07, anterior cervical discectomy and fusions C4-5, C5-6, C6-7 using Bengal cages and Slimlock plate C4 to C7; intraoperative x-ray.,This is a 60-year-old white male who was in the office on 05/01/07 because of neck pain with left radiculopathy and ""tension headaches.""  In the last year or so, he has had more and more difficulty and more recently has developed tingling and numbness into the fingers of the left hand greater than right.  He has some neck pain at times and has seen Dr. X for an epidural steroid injection, which was very helpful.  More recently he saw Dr. Y and went through some physical therapy without much relief.,Cervical MRI scan was obtained and revealed a large right-sided disc herniation at C4-5 with significant midline herniations at C5-6 and a large left HNP at C6-7.  In view of the multiple levels of pathology, I was not confident that anything short of surgical intervention would give him significant relief.  The procedure and its risk were fully discussed and he decided to proceed with the operation.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , Following admission, the procedure was carried out without difficulty.  Blood loss was about 125 cc.  Postop x-ray showed good alignment and positioning of the cages, plate, and screws.  After surgery, he was able to slowly increase his activity level with assistance from physical therapy.  He had some muscle spasm and soreness between the shoulder blades and into the back part of his neck.  He also had some nausea with the PCA.  He had a low-grade fever to 100.2 and was started on incentive spirometry.  Over the next 12 hours, his fever resolved and he was able to start getting up and around much more easily.,By 06/27/07, he was ready to go home.

3271,"CLINICAL HISTORY: ,This 78-year-old black woman has a history of hypertension, but no other cardiac problems. She noted complaints of fatigue, lightheadedness, and severe dyspnea on exertion. She was evaluated by her PCP on January 31st and her ECG showed sinus bradycardia with a rate of 37 beats per minute. She has had intermittent severe sinus bradycardia alternating with a normal sinus rhythm, consistent with sinoatrial exit block, and she is on no medications known to cause bradycardia. An echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 70% without significant valvular heart disease.,PROCEDURE:, Implantation of a dual chamber permanent pacemaker.,APPROACH:, Left cephalic vein.,LEADS IMPLANTED: ,Medtronic model 12345 in the right atrium, serial number 12345.

The left neck and chest were prepped and draped in the usual manner and the skin and subcutaneous tissues below the left clavicle were infiltrated with 1% lidocaine for local anesthesia. A 2-1/2-inch incision was made below the left clavicle and electrocautery was used for hemostasis. Dissection was carried out to the level of the pectoralis fascia and extended caudally to create a pocket for the pulse generator. The deltopectoral groove was explored and a medium-sized cephalic vein was identified. The distal end of the vein was ligated and a venotomy was performed. Two guide wires were advanced to the superior vena cava and peel-away introducer sheaths were used to insert the two pacing leads. The venous pressures were elevated and there was a fair amount of back-bleeding from the vein, so a 3-0 Monocryl figure-of-eight stitch was placed around the tissue surrounding the vein for hemostasis. The right ventricular lead was placed in the high RV septum and the right atrial lead was placed in the right atrial appendage. The leads were tested with a pacing systems analyzer and the results are noted above. The leads were then anchored in place with #0-silk around their suture sleeve and connected to the pulse generator. The pacemaker was noted to function appropriately. The pocket was then irrigated with antibiotic solution and the pacemaker system was placed in the pocket. The incision was closed with two layers of 3-0 Monocryl and a subcuticular closure of 4-0 Monocryl. The incision was dressed with Steri-Strips and a sterile bandage and the patient was returned to her room in good condition.,IMPRESSION: ,Successful implantation of a dual chamber permanent pacemaker via the left cephalic vein. The patient will be observed overnight and will go home in the morning.",1.0

397,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Adenocarcinoma of the prostate.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Adenocarcinoma of the prostate.,TITLE OF OPERATION:,  Mini-laparotomy radical retropubic prostatectomy with bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection with Cavermap.,ANESTHESIA: , General by intubation.,Informed consent was obtained for the procedure.  The patient understands the treatment options and wishes to proceed.  He accepts the risks to include bleeding requiring transfusion, infection, sepsis, incontinence, impotence, bladder neck constricture, heart attack, stroke, pulmonary emboli, phlebitis, injury to the bladder, rectum, or ureter, etcetera.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the Operating Room and placed in the supine position, prepped with Betadine solution and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 20- French Foley catheter was inserted into the penis and into the bladder and placed to dependent drainage.  The table was then placed in minimal flexed position.  A midline skin incision was then made from the umbilicus to the symphysis pubis.  It was carried down to the anterior rectus fascia into the pelvis proper.  Both obturator fossae were exposed.  Standard bilateral pelvic lymph node dissections were carried out.  The left side was approached first by myself.  The limits of my dissection were from the external iliac vein laterally to the obturator nerve medially, and from the bifurcation of the common iliac vein proximally to Cooper's ligament distally.  Meticulous lymphostasis and hemostasis was obtained using hemoclips and 2-0 silk ligatures.  The obturator nerve was visualized throughout and was not injured.  The right side was carried out by my assistant under my direct and constant supervision.  Again, the obturator nerve was visualized throughout and it was not injured.  Both packets were sent to Pathology where no evidence of carcinoma was found.,My attention was then directed to the prostate itself.  The  endopelvic fascia was opened bilaterally.  Using gentle dissection with a Kitner, I swept the levator muscles off the prostate and exposed the apical portion of the prostate.  A back bleeding control suture of 0 Vicryl was placed at the mid-prostate level.  A sternal wire was then placed behind the dorsal vein complex which was sharply transected.  The proximal and distal portions of this complex were then oversewn with 2-0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  When I was satisfied that hemostasis was complete, my attention was then turned to the neurovascular bundles.,The urethra was then sharply transected and six sutures of 2-0 Monocryl placed at the 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 o'clock positions.  The prostate was then lifted retrograde in the field and was swept from the anterior surface of the rectum and the posterior layer of Denonvilliers' fascia was incised distally, swept off the rectum and incorporated with the prostate specimen.  The lateral pedicles over the seminal vesicles were then mobilized, hemoclipped and transected.  The seminal vesicles themselves were then mobilized and hemostasis obtained using hemoclips.  Ampullae of the vas were mobilized, hemoclipped and transected.  The bladder neck was then developed using careful blunt and sharp dissection.  The prostate was then transected at the level of the bladder neck and sent for permanent specimen.  The bladder neck was reevaluated and the ureteral orifices were found to be placed well back from the edge.  The bladder neck was reconstructed in standard fashion.  It was closed using a running 2-0 Vicryl.  The mucosa was everted over the edge of the bladder neck using interrupted 3-0 Vicryl suture.  At the end of this portion of the case, the new bladder neck had a stoma-like appearance and would accommodate easily my small finger.  The field was then re-evaluated for hemostasis which was further obtained using hemoclips, Bovie apparatus and 3-0 chromic ligatures.  When I was satisfied that hemostasis was complete, the aforementioned Monocryl sutures were then placed at the corresponding positions in the bladder neck.  A new 20-French Foley catheter was brought in through the urethra into the bladder.  A safety suture of 0 Prolene was brought through the end of this and out through a separate stab wound in the bladder and through the left lateral quadrant.  The table was taken out of flexion and the bladder was then brought into approximation to the urethra and the Monocryl sutures were ligated.  The bladder was then copiously irrigated with sterile water and the anastomosis was found to be watertight.  The pelvis was also copiously irrigated with 2 liters of sterile water.  A 10-French Jackson-Pratt drain was placed in the pelvis and brought out through the right lower quadrant and sutured in place with a 2-0 silk ligature.,The wound was then closed in layers.  The muscle was closed with a running 0 chromic, the fascia with a running 1-0 Vicryl, the subcutaneous tissue with 3-0 plain, and the skin with a running 4-0 Vicryl subcuticular.  Steri-Strips were applied and a sterile dressing.,The patient was taken to the Recovery Room in good condition.  There were no complications.  Sponge and instrument counts were reported correct at the end of the case.",1.0

The patient was status post coronary artery bypass surgery aortic valve repair at Shadyside Hospital.  The patient subsequently developed CVA.  She also developed thrombosis of the right arm, which ultimately required right hand amputation.  She was stabilized and eventually transferred to HealthSouth for further management.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,Vital Signs:  Pulse of 90 and blood pressure 150/70.,Heart:  Sounds were heard, grade 2/6 systolic murmur at the precordium.,Chest:  Clinically clear.,Abdomen:  Some suprapubic tenderness.  Evidence of right lower arm amputation.,The patient was started on Prevacid 30 mg daily, levothyroxine 75 mcg a day, Toprol 25 mg twice a day, Zofran 4 mg q.6 h, Coumadin dose at 5 mg and was adjusted.  She was given a pain control using Vicodin and Percocet, amiodarone 200 mg a day, Lexapro 20 mg a day, Plavix 75 mg a day, fenofibrate 145 mg, Lasix 20 mg IV twice a day, Lantus 50 units at bedtime and Humalog 10 units a.c. and sliding scale insulin coverage.  Wound care to the right heel was supervised by Dr. X.  The patient initially was fed through NG tube, which was eventually discontinued.  Physical therapy was ordered.  The patient continued to do well.  She was progressively ambulated.  Her meds were continuously adjusted.  The patient's insulin was eventually changed from Lantus to Levemir 25 units twice a day.  Dr. Y also followed the patient closely for left heel ulcer.,LABORATORY DATA: , The latest cultures from left heel are pending.  Her electrolytes revealed sodium of 135 and potassium of 3.2.  Her potassium was switched to K-Dur 40 mEq twice a day.  Her blood chemistries are otherwise closely monitored.  INRs were obtained and were therapeutic.  Throughout her hospitalization, multiple cultures were also obtained.  Urine cultures grew Klebsiella.  She was treated with appropriate antibiotics.  Her detailed blood work is as in the chart.  Detailed radiological studies are as in the chart.  The patient made a steady progress and eventually plans were made to transfer the patient to ABC furthermore aggressive rehabilitation.,FINAL DIAGNOSES:,1.

He was rendered unconscious by the head injury.  He underwent an extensive syncopal workup in Mississippi.  This workup was negative.  The patient does indeed have a heart pacemaker.  The patient was admitted to ABCD three days ago and yesterday underwent a CT scan, which showed a large appearance of subdural hematoma.  There is a history of some bladder tumors and so a scan with contrast was obtained that showed some enhancement in the membranes.  I decided to perform a craniotomy rather than burr hole drainage because of the enhancing membranes and the history of a bladder tumor undefined as well as layering of the blood within the cavity.  The patient and the family understood the nature, indications, and risk of the surgery and agreed to go ahead.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room where general and endotracheal anesthesia was obtained.  The head was turned over to the left side and was supported on a cushion.  There was a roll beneath the right shoulder.  The right calvarium was shaved and prepared in the usual manner with Betadine-soaked scrub followed by Betadine paint.  Markings were applied.  Sterile drapes were applied.  A linear incision was made more or less along the coronal suture extending from just above the ear up to near the midline.  Sharp dissection was carried down into subcutaneous tissue and Bovie electrocautery was used to divide the galea and the temporalis muscle and fascia.  Weitlaner retractors were inserted.  A single bur hole was placed underneath the temporalis muscle.  I placed the craniotomy a bit low in order to have better cosmesis.  A cookie cutter type craniotomy was then carried out in dimensions about 5 cm x 4 cm.  The bone was set aside.  The dura was clearly discolored and very tense.  The dura was opened in a cruciate fashion with a #15 blade.  There was immediate flow of a thin motor oil fluid under high pressure.  Literally the fluid shot out several inches with the first nick in the membranous cavity.  The dura was reflected back and biopsy of the membranes was taken and sent for permanent section.  The margins of the membrane were coagulated.  The microscope was brought in and it was apparent there were septations within the cavity and these septations were for the most part divided with bipolar electrocautery.  The wound was irrigated thoroughly and was inspected carefully for any sites of bleeding and there were none.  The dura was then closed in a watertight fashion using running locking 4-0 Nurolon.  Tack-up sutures had been placed at the beginning of the case and the bone flap was returned to the wound and fixed to the skull using the Lorenz plating system.  The wound was irrigated thoroughly once more and was closed in layers.  Muscle fascia and galea were closed in separate layers with interrupted inverted 2-0 Vicryl.  Finally, the skin was closed with running locking 3-0 nylon.,Estimated blood loss for the case was less than 30 mL.  Sponge and needle counts were correct.,FINDINGS: , Chronic subdural hematoma with multiple septations and thickened subdural membrane.,I might add that the arachnoid was not violated at all during this procedure.  Also, it was noted that there was no subarachnoid blood but only subdural blood.",1.0

She was afebrile.  She was taken by Dr. X to the operating room.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , The patient underwent a procedure.  She tolerated without difficulty.  She had her pain controlled with p.o. pain medicine.  She was afebrile.  She is tolerating liquid diet.  It was felt that the patient is stable for discharge.  She did complain of bladder spasms when she urinated and she did say that she has a history of chronic UTIs.  We will check a UA and urine culture prior to discharge.  I will give her prescription for ciprofloxacin that she can take for 3 days presumptively and I have discharged her home with omeprazole and Colace to take over-the-counter for constipation and we will send her home with Percocet for pain.  Her labs were within normal limits.  She did have an elevated white blood cell count, but I believe this is just leukemoid reaction, but she is afebrile, and if she does have UTI, may also be related.  Her labs in terms of her bilirubin were within normal limits.  Her LFTs were slightly elevated, I do believe this is related to the cautery used on the liver bed.  They were 51 and 83 for the AST and ALT respectively.  I feel that she looks good for discharge.,DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: , Clear liquid diet x48 hours and she can return to her Medifast, she may shower.  She needs to keep her wound clean and dry.  She is not to engage in any heavy lifting greater than 10 pounds x2 weeks.  No driving for 1 to 2 weeks.  She must be able to stop in an emergency and be off narcotic meds, no strenuous activity, but she needs to maintain mobility.  She can resume her medications per med rec sheets.,DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: , As previously mentioned.,FOLLOWUP:,  We will follow up on both urinalysis and cultures.  She is instructed to follow up with Dr. X in 2 weeks.

The patient had a chest x-ray and based on that there is concern by the Radiology it could be a foreign body in the right main stem.  The patient has been taken to the operating room for rigid bronchoscopy and foreign body removal.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room, placed supine, put under general mask anesthesia.  Using a 3.5 rigid bronchoscope we visualized between the cords into the trachea.  There were some secretions but that looked okay.  Got down at the level of the carina to see a foreign body flapping in the right main stem.  I then used graspers to grasp to try to pull into the scope itself.  I could not do that, I thus had to pull the scope out along with the foreign body that was held on to with a grasper.  It appeared to be consisting of some type of plastic piece that had broke off some different object.  I took the scope and put it back down into the airway again.  Again, there was secretion in the trachea that we suctioned out.  We looked down into the right bronchus intermedius.  There was no other pathology noted, just some irritation in the right main stem area.  I looked down the left main stem as well and that looked okay as well.  I then withdrew the scope.  Trachea looked fine as well as the cords.  I put the patient back on mask oxygen to wake the patient up.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.",1.0
3425,"CC: , ""Five years ago, I stopped drinking and since that time, I have had severe depression.  I was doing okay when I stopped my medications in April for a few weeks, but then I got depressed again.  I started lithium three weeks ago."",HPI:  ,The patient is a 45-year-old married white female without children currently working as a billing analyst for Northwest Natural.  The patient has had one psychiatric hospitalization for seven days in April of 1999.  The patient now presents with recurrent depressive symptoms for approximately four months.  The patient states that she has decreased energy, suicidal ideation, suicide plan, feelings of guilt, feelings of extreme anger, psychomotor agitation, and increased appetite.  The patient states her sleep is normal and her ability to concentrate is normal.  The patient states that last night she had an argument with her husband in which he threaten to divorce her.  The patient went into the rest room, tried to find a razor blade, could not find one but instead found a scissor and cut her arm moderately with some moderate depth.  She felt better after doing so and put a bandage over the wound and did not report to her husband or anybody else what she had done.  The patient reports that she has had increased tension with her husband as of recent.  She notes that approximately a week ago she struck her husband several times.  She states that he has never hit her but instead pushed her back after she was hitting him.  She reports no history of abuse in the past.  The patient identifies recent stressors as having ongoing conflict at work with her administrator with them ""cracking down on me."" The patient also notes that her longstanding therapy will be temporarily interrupted by the therapist having a child.  She states that her recent depression seems to coincide with her growing knowledge that her therapist was pregnant.  The patient states that she has a tremendous amount of anger towards her therapist for discontinuing or postponing treatment.  She states that she feels ""abandoned."" The patient notes that it does raise issues with her past, where she had a child at the age of 17 who she gave away for adoption and a second child that she was pregnant by the age of 42 that she aborted at the request of her husband.  The patient states she saw her therapist most recently last Friday.  She sees the therapy weekly and indicates the therapy helps, although she is unable to specify how.  When asked for specifics of what she has learned from the therapy, the patient was unable to reply.  It appears that she is very concrete and has difficulty with symbolization and abstractions and self-observation.  The patient reports that at her last visit her therapist was concerned that she may be suicidal and was considering hospitalization.  The patient, at that point, stated that she would be safe through Monday despite having made a gesture last night.  At present, the patient's mood is reactive and for much of the session she appears angry and irritated with me but at the end of the session, after I have given her my assessment, she appears calmed and not depressed.  When asked if she is suicidal at present, she states no.  The patient does not want to go into the hospital.  The patient also indicates at the end of the session she felt hopeful.  The patient reports her current sleep is about eight hours per night.  She states that longest she has been able to stay awake in the past has been 24 hours.  She states that during periods where she feels up she sleeps perhaps six hours per night.  The patient reports no spending sprees and no reports no sexual indiscretions.  The patient states that her sexuality does increase when she is feeling better but not enormously so.  The patient denies any history of delusions or hallucinations.  The patient denies any psychosis.  The patient states that she does have mood swings and that the upstate lasts for a couple of weeks at longest.  She states that more predominately she has depression.  The patient states that she does not engage in numerous projects when she is in an upstate although does imagine doing so.  The patient notes that suicidality and depression seems to often arise around disputes with her husband and/or feelings of abandonment.  The patient indicates some satisfaction when she is called on her behavior ""I need to answer for my actions."" The patient gives a substantial history of alcohol abuse lasting up to about five years ago when she was hospitalized.  Most typically, the patient will drink at least a bottle of wine per day.  The patient has attended AA but at present going once a week, although she states that she is not engaged as she has been in the past; and when asked if she may be in early relapse, she indicates that yes that is a very real possibility.  The patient states she is not working through any of the steps at present.,PPH: , The patient denies any sexual abuse as a child.  She states that she was disciplined primarily by her father with spankings.  She states that on occasion her mother would use a belt to spank her or with her hand or with a spoon.  The patient has been seeing Dr. A for the past five years.  Prior to that she was admitted to a hospital for her suicide attempt.  The patient also has one short treatment experienced with the Day Treatment Program here in Portland.  The patient states that it was not useful as it focused on group work with pts that she did not feel any similarity with.  The patient, also as a child, had a history of cutting behaviors.  The patient was admitted to the hospital after lacerating her arm.,MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,The patient has hypothyroidism and last had her TSH drawn a week ago but does not know the results.  Janet Green is her primary physician.  The patient also has had herniated disc in the neck and a sinus inflammation, both of which were treated surgically.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , The patient currently is taking Synthroid 75 mcg per day and lithium 1200 mg p.o. q.d. The patient started the lithium approximately three weeks ago and has not had a recent lithium level or kidney function test.,ALLERGIES: , No known drug allergies.,SUBSTANCE HISTORY: , The patient has been sober for five years.  She drank one bottle of wine per day as per HPI.  History of drinking for approximately 25 years.  The patient does not currently have a sponsor.  The patient experimented with amphetamines, cocaine, marijuana approximately 16 years ago.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient's mother is age 66, father is age 70, and she has a brother age 44.  Her brother has been incarcerated numerous times for assaults and has difficulty with anger and rage.  He made a suicide attempt at age 17.  The patient's father is a machinist who she describes as somewhat narcissistic and with alcohol abuse problem.  He also has arthritis.  The patient's mother is arthritic.  She states that her mother stopped working at middle age after being laid off and appears somewhat reclusive.,EDUCATIONAL HISTORY: , The patient was educated through high school and has two years of Night College.  The patient states that she grew up and was raised in Portland but notes her childhood was primarily lonely.  She states she was unliked and unpopular child because she was ""shy"" and ""not smart enough."" The patient denies having secrets.  The patient reports that this is her second marriage, which has lasted two years.  Her first marriage lasted I believe it was five years.  The patient also had a relationship in recovery for four years, which ended after they went ""different directions."",MSE:,  The patient is middle-aged white female, dressed in a red sweater with a white shirt, full patterned skirt, and open sandals.  The patient is suspicious and somewhat confrontative early in the session.  She asked me regarding my cancellation policy, why I require seven days and not 24 hours.  The patient also is irritated with paper required of her.  Psychomotor is increased slightly.  The patient makes strong eye contact.  Speech is normal rate, rhythm, and volume.  Mood is ""irritated."" Affect is irritated, angry, demanding, attempting to wrest control from me, depressed, frustrated.  Thought is directed.  Content is nondelusional.  There are no auditory and no visual hallucinations.  The patient has no homicidal ideation.  The patient does endorse suicidal ideations.  Regarding plan, the patient notes that cutting herself hurts too much therefore she would like to take some benzodiazepines or barbiturates but has access to none.  The patient states that she will not try to hurt herself currently and that she poses no risk at present.  The patient notes that she does not want to go to the hospital at present.  The patient is alert and oriented x 3.  Recall is three for three at five minutes.  Proverbs are concrete.  She has fair impulse control, poor judgment, and poor insight.,FORMULATION:  ,The patient is a 45-year-old married white female with no children now presenting with recurrent depressive symptoms and active suicidal ideation and planning.  The patient reports longstanding depressive symptoms that were subthreshold punctuated by periods of more severe depression.  The patient also reports some up periods, which do not meet most criteria for a bipolar disorder or manic states.  The patient notes that current depression started with approximately the same time that she became aware that her therapist was pregnant.  She notes that the current depression is atypical in that it is primarily anger based and she does not have the typical hypersomnia that she gets.  The patient reports being unable to express anger to her therapist and being unable to discuss her feeling regarding the pregnancy.  The patient also states that she feels abandoned with the upcoming discontinuation of treatment while the therapist is giving birth and thereafter.  Symptoms are consistent with a longstanding dysthymia and reoccurring depression.  In addition, diagnosis is highly complicated by presence of a strong personality disorder component, most likely borderline personality disorder.  This latter diagnosis seems to be the most active at this time with the patient acutely reacting to perceived therapist's absence and departure.  This is exacerbated by instability in the patient's marital life.,DIAGNOSIS:,Axis I:  Dysthymia.  Major depression, moderate severity, recurrent, with partial remission.,Axis II:  Borderline personality disorder.,Axis III:  Hypothyroidism and cervical disc herniation and sinus surgery.,Axis IV:  Medical access.  Marital discord.,Axis V:  A GAF of 30.,PLAN:  ,The patient is unlikely to have bipolar disorder.  We will recommend the patient's thyroid be rechecked to ensure she is currently euthymic.  We would recommend continued weekly or twice weekly insight oriented psychotherapy with aggressive exploration of the patient's reaction to her therapist's departure.  We would also recommend dialectical behavioral therapy while the therapist is on leave.  We would recommend continued treatment with SSRIs for dysthymia and depression.  We would suggest prescribing long acting antidepressant such as Prozac, given the patient's ambivalence regarding medications.  Prozac should be pushed to minimum of 40 mg, which the patient has already tolerated in the past, but most likely up to 60 or 80 mg.  We might also supplement the Prozac with a (anti-sleep medication).,Time spent with the patient was 1.5 hours.",1.0

A thoracostomy tube was placed at the bedside with only partial resolution of the pleural effusion.  On CT scan evaluation, there is evidence of an entrapped right lower lobe with loculations.  Decision was made to proceed with surgical intervention for a complete decortication and the patient understands the need for surgery and signed the preoperative informed consent.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operative suite and placed in the supine position under general anesthesia per Anesthesia Department.  Intraoperative bronchoscopy was performed by Dr. Y and evaluation of carina, left upper and lower lobes with segmental evidence of diffuse mucous, thick secretions which were thoroughly lavaged with sterile saline lavage.  Samples were obtained from both the left and the right subbronchiole segments for Gram stain cultures and ASP evaluation.  The right bronchus lower, middle, and upper were also examined and subsegmental bronchiole areas were thoroughly examined with no evidence of masses, lesions, or suspicious extrinsic compressions on the bronchi.  At this point, all mucous secretions were thoroughly irrigated and aspirated until the airways were clear.  Bronchoscope was then removed.  Vital signs remained stable throughout this portion of the procedure.  The patient was re-intubated by Anesthesia with a double lumen endotracheal tube.  At this point, the patient was repositioned in the left lateral decubitus position with protection of all pressure points and the table was extended in customary fashion.  At this point, the right chest was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The chest tube was removed before prepping the patient and the prior thoracostomy site was cleansed thoroughly with Betadine.  The first port was placed through this incision intrathoracically.  A bronchoscope was placed for inspection of the intrathoracic cavity.  Pictures were taken.  There is extensive fibrinous exudate noted under parietal and visceral pleura, encompassing the lung surface, diaphragm, and the posterolateral aspect of the right thorax.  At this point, a second port site anteriorly was placed under direct visualization.  With the aid of the thoracoscopic view, a Yankauer resection device was placed in the thorax and blunt decortication was performed and aspiration of reminder of the pleural fluid.  Due to the gelatinous nature of the fibrinous exudate, there were areas of right upper lobe that adhered to the chest wall and the middle and lower lobes appeared entrapped.  Due to the extensive nature of the disease, decision was made to open the chest in a formal right thoracotomy fashion.  Incision was made.  The subcutaneous tissues were then electrocauterized down to the level of the latissimus dorsi, which was separated with electrocautery down to the anterior 6th rib space.  The chest cavity was entered with the right lung deflated per Anesthesia at our request.  Once the intrathoracic cavity was accessed, a thorough decortication was performed in meticulous systematic fashion starting with the right upper lobe, middle, and the right lower lobe.  With the expansion of the lung and reduction of the pleural surface fibrinous extubate, warm irrigation was used and the lungs allowed to re-expand.  There was no evidence of gross leakage or bleeding at the conclusion of surgery.,Full lung re-expansion was noted upon re-inflation of the lung.  Two #32 French thoracostomy tubes were placed, one anteriorly straight and one posteriorly on the diaphragmatic sulcus.  The chest tubes were secured in place with #0-silk sutures and placed on Pneumovac suction.  Next, the ribs were reapproximated with five interrupted CTX sutures and latissimus dorsi was then reapproximated with a running #2-0 Vicryl suture.  Next, subcutaneous skin was closed sequentially with a cosmetic layered subcutaneous closure.  Steri-Strips were applied along with sterile occlusive dressings.  The patient was awakened from anesthesia without difficulty and extubated in the operating room.  The chest tubes were maintained on Pleur-Evac suction for full re-expansion of the lung.  The patient was transported to the recovery with vital signs stable.  Stat portable chest x-ray is pending.  The patient will be admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for close monitoring overnight.",2.0

1452,"REASON FOR VISIT:,  Followup status post L4-L5 laminectomy and bilateral foraminotomies, and L4-L5 posterior spinal fusion with instrumentation.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  Ms. ABC returns today for followup status post L4-L5 laminectomy and bilateral foraminotomies, and posterior spinal fusion on 06/08/07.,Preoperatively, her symptoms, those of left lower extremity are radicular pain.,She had not improved immediately postoperatively.  She had a medial breech of a right L4 pedicle screw.  We took her back to the operating room same night and reinserted the screw.  Postoperatively, her pain had improved.,I had last seen her on 06/28/07 at which time she was doing well.  She had symptoms of what she thought was ""restless leg syndrome"" at that time.  She has been put on ReQuip for this.,She returned.  I had spoken to her 2 days ago and she had stated that her right lower extremity pain was markedly improved.  I had previously evaluated this for a pain possibly relating to deep venous thrombosis and ultrasound was negative.  She states that she had recurrent left lower extremity pain, which was similar to the pain she had preoperatively but in a different distribution, further down the leg.  Thus, I referred her for a lumbar spine radiograph and lumbar spine MRI and she presents today for evaluation.,She states that overall, she is improved compared to preoperatively.  She is ambulating better than she was preoperatively.  The pain is not as severe as it was preoperatively.  The right leg pain is improved.  The left lower extremity pain is in a left L4 and L5 distribution radiating to the great toe and first web space on the left side.,She denies any significant low back pain.  No right lower extremity symptoms.,No infectious symptoms whatsoever.  No fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath.  No drainage from the wound.  No difficulties with the incision.,FINDINGS:  ,On examination, Ms. ABC is a pleasant, well-developed, well-nourished female in no apparent distress.  Alert and oriented x 3.  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Respirations are normal and nonlabored.  Afebrile to touch.,Left tibialis anterior strength is 3 out of 5, extensor hallucis strength is 2 out of 5.  Gastroc-soleus strength is 3 to 4 out of 5.  This has all been changed compared to preoperatively.  Motor strength is otherwise 4 plus out of 5.  Light touch sensation decreased along the medial aspect of the left foot.  Straight leg raise test normal bilaterally.,The incision is well healed.  There is no fluctuance or fullness with the incision whatsoever.  No drainage.,Radiographs obtained today demonstrate pedicle screw placement at L4 and L5 bilaterally without evidence of malposition or change in orientation of the screws.,Lumbar spine MRI performed on 07/03/07 is also reviewed.,It demonstrates evidence of adequate decompression at L4 and L5.  There is a moderate size subcutaneous fluid collection seen, which does not appear compressive and may be compatible with normal postoperative fluid collection, especially given the fact that she had a revision surgery performed.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  ,Ms. ABC is doing relatively well status post L4 and L5 laminectomy and bilateral foraminotomies, and posterior spinal fusion with instrumentation on 07/08/07.  The case is significant for merely misdirected right L4 pedicle screw, which was reoriented with subsequent resolution of symptoms.,I am uncertain with regard to the etiology of the symptoms.  However, it does appear that the radiographs demonstrate appropriate positioning of the instrumentation, no hardware shift, and the MRI demonstrates only a postoperative suprafascial fluid collection.  I do not see any indication for another surgery at this time.,I would also like to hold off on an interventional pain management given the presence of the fluid collection to decrease the risk of infection.,My recommendation at this time is that the patient is to continue with mobilization.  I have reassured her that her spine appears stable at this time.  She is happy with this.,I would like her to continue ambulating as much as possible.  She can go ahead and continue with ReQuip for the restless leg syndrome as her primary care physician has suggested.  I have also her referred to Mrs. Khan at Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation for continued aggressive management.,I will see her back in followup in 3 to 4 weeks to make sure that she continues to improve.  She knows that if she has any difficulties, she may follow up with me sooner.",1.0

3310,"PROCEDURE:,1.  Implantation, dual chamber ICD.,2.  Fluoroscopy.,3.  Defibrillation threshold testing.,4.  Venography.,PROCEDURE NOTE: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room.  The patient was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  Using modified Seldinger technique, the left subclavian vein was attempted to be punctured but unsuccessfully.  Approximately 10 cc of intravenous contrast was injected into the left upper extremity peripheral vein.  Venogram was then performed.  Under fluoroscopy via modified Seldinger technique, the left subclavian vein was punctured and a guidewire was passed through the vein into the superior vena cava, then the right atrium and then into the inferior vena cava.  A second guidewire was placed in a similar fashion.  Approximately a 5 cm incision was made in the left upper anterior chest.  The skin and subcutaneous tissue was dissected out of the prepectoral fascia.  Both guide wires were brought into the pocket area.  A sheath was placed over the lateral guidewire and fluoroscopically guided to the vena cava.  The dilator and guidewire were removed.  A Fixation ventricular lead, under fluoroscopic guidance, was placed through the sheath into the superior vena cava, right atrium and then right ventricle.  Using straight and curved stylettes, it was placed in position and screwed into the right ventricular apex.  After pacing and sensing parameters were established in the lead, the collar on the lead was sutured to the pectoral muscle with Ethibond suture.  A guide sheath was placed over the guidewire and fluoroscopically placed in the superior vena cava.  The dilator and guidewire were removed.  An Active Fixation atrial lead was fluoroscopically passed through the sheath, into the superior vena cava and then the right atrium.  Using straight and J-shaped stylettes, it was placed in the appropriate position and screwed in the right atrial appendage area.  After significant pacing parameters were established in the lead, the collar on the lead was sutured to the pectoral muscles with Ethibond suture.  The tract was flushed with saline solution.  A Medtronic pulse generator was attached to both the leads and fixed to the pectoral muscle with Ethibond suture.  Deep and superficial layers were closed with 3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  Steri-strips were placed over the incision.  Tegaderm was placed over the Steri-strips.  Pressure dressing was applied to the pocket area.",2.0

Allograft C5-C6.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General endotracheal.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,PATIENT STATUS: , Taken to recovery room in stable condition.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is a 36-year-old female who has had severe, recalcitrant right upper extremity pain, numbness, tingling, shoulder pain, axial neck pain, and headaches for many months.  Nonoperative measures failed to relieve her symptoms and surgical intervention was requested.  We discussed reasonable risks, benefits, and alternatives of various treatment options.  Continuation of nonoperative care versus the risks associated with surgery were discussed.  She understood the risks including bleeding, nerve vessel damage, infection, hoarseness, dysphagia, adjacent segment degeneration, continued worsening pain, failed fusion, and potential need for further surgery.  Despite these risks, she felt that current symptoms will be best managed operatively.,SUMMARY OF SURGERY IN DETAIL: , Following informed consent and preoperative administration of antibiotics, the patient was brought to the operating suite.  General anesthetic was administered.  The patient was placed in the supine position.  All prominences and neurovascular structures were well accommodated.  The patient was noted to have pulse in this position.  Preoperative x-rays revealed appropriate levels for skin incision.  Ten pound inline traction was placed via Gardner-Wells tongs and shoulder roll was placed.  The patient was then prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  Standard oblique incision was made over the C6 vertebral body in the proximal nuchal skin crease.  Subcutaneous tissue was dissected down to the level of the omohyoid which was transected.  Blunt dissection was carried out with the trachea and the esophagus in the midline and the carotid sheath in its vital structures laterally.  This was taken down to the prevertebral fascia which was bluntly split.  Intraoperative x-ray was taken to ensure proper levels.  Longus colli was identified and reflected proximally 3 to 4 mm off the midline bilaterally so that the anterior cervical Trimline retractor could be placed underneath the longus colli, thus placing no new traction on the surrounding vital structures.  Inferior spondylosis was removed with high-speed bur.  A scalpel and curette was used to remove the disc.  Decompression was carried posterior to the posterior longitudinal ligament down to the uncovertebral joints bilaterally.  Disc herniation was removed from the right posterolateral aspect of the interspace.  High-speed bur was used to prepare the endplate down to good bleeding bone and preparation for fusion.  Curette and ball tip dissector was then passed out the foramen and along the ventral aspect of the dura.  No further evidence of compression was identified.  Hemostasis was achieved with thrombin-soaked Gelfoam.  Interspace was then distracted with Caspar pin distractions set gently.  Interspace was then gently retracted with the Caspar pin distraction set.  An 8-mm allograft was deemed in appropriate fit.  This was press fit with demineralized bone matrix and tamped firmly into position achieving excellent interference fit.  The graft was stable to pull-out forces.  Distraction and traction was then removed and anterior cervical instrumentation was completed using a DePuy Trimline anterior cervical plate with 14-mm self-drilling screws.  Plate and screws were then locked to the plate.  Final x-rays revealed proper positioning of the plate, excellent distraction in the disc space, and apposition of the endplates and allograft.  Wounds were copiously irrigated with normal saline.  Omohyoid was approximated with 3-0 Vicryl.  Running 3-0 Vicryl was used to close the platysma.  Subcuticular Monocryl and Steri-Strips were used to close the skin.  A deep drain was placed prior to wound closure.  The patient was then allowed to awake from general anesthetic and was taken to the recovery room in stable condition.  There were no intraoperative complications.  All needle and sponge counts were correct.  Intraoperative neurologic monitoring was used throughout the entirety of the case and was normal.",2.0

The arm was exsanguinated.  The tourniquet was elevated at 290 mm/Hg.  Construction lines were made on the left palm to identify the ring ray.  A transverse incision was made in the wrist, between FCR and FCU, one fingerbreadth proximal to the interval between the glabrous skin of the palm and normal forearm skin.  Blunt dissection exposed the antebrachial fascia.  Hemostasis was obtained with bipolar cautery.  A distal-based window in the antebrachial fascia was then fashioned.  Care was taken to protect the underlying contents.  A proximal forearm fasciotomy was performed under direct vision.  A synovial elevator was used to palpate the undersurface of the transverse carpal ligament, and synovium was elevated off this undersurface.  Hamate sounds were then used to palpate the hook of hamate.  The endoscopic instrument was then inserted into the proximal incision.  The transverse carpal ligament was easily visualized through the portal.  Using palmar pressure, the transverse carpal ligament was held against the portal as the instrument was inserted down the transverse carpal ligament to the distal end.,The distal end of the transverse carpal ligament was then identified in the window.  The blade was then elevated, and the endoscopic instrument was withdrawn, dividing the transverse carpal ligament under direct vision.  After complete division o the transverse carpal ligament, the instrument was reinserted.  Radial and ulnar edges of the transverse carpal ligament were identified, and complete release was confirmed.,The wound was then closed with running subcuticular stitch.  Steri-Strips were applied, and sterile dressing was applied over the Steri-Strips.  The tourniquet was deflated.  The patient was awakened from anesthesia and returned to the Recovery Room in satisfactory condition, having tolerated the procedure well.,DE QUERVAIN'S RELEASE: , With the patient under adequate regional anesthesia applied by surgeon using 1% plain Xylocaine, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in a sterile manner.  The arm was exsanguinated.  The tourniquet was elevated to 290 mm/Hg.  A transverse incision was then made over the radial aspect of the wrist overlying the first dorsal tunnel.  Using blunt dissection, the radial sensory nerve branches were dissected and retracted out of the operative field.  The first dorsal tunnel was then identified.  The first dorsal tunnel was incised along the dorsal ulnar border, completely freeing the stenosing tenosynovitis (de Quervain's release).  EPB and APL tendons were inspected and found to be completely free.  The radial sensory nerve was inspected and found to be without damage.,The skin was closed with a running 3-0 Prolene subcuticular stitch and Steri-Strips were applied and, over the Steri-Strips, a sterile dressing, and, over the sterile dressing, a volar splint with the hand in safe position.  The tourniquet was deflated.  The patient was returned to the holding area in satisfactory condition, having tolerated the procedure well.",2.0

222,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Term pregnancy at 40 and 3/7th weeks.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Spontaneous vaginal delivery.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,The patient is a 36-year-old African-American female who is a G-2, P-2-0-0-2 with an EDC of 08/30/2003.  She is blood type AB -ve with antibody screen negative and is also rubella immune, VDRL nonreactive, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, and HIV nonreactive.  She does have a history of sickle cell trait.  She presented to Labor and Delivery Triage at 40 and 3/7th weeks gestation with complaint of contractions every ten minutes.  She also stated that she has lost her mucous plug.  She did have fetal movement, noted no leak of fluid, did have some spotting.  On evaluation of triage, she was noted to be contracting approximately every five minutes and did have discomfort with her contractions.  She was evaluated by sterile vaginal exam and was noted to be 4 cm dilated, 70% effaced, and -3 station.  This was a change from her last office exam, at which she was 1 cm to 2 cm dilated.,PROCEDURE DETAILS:,  The patient was admitted to Labor and Delivery for expected management of labor and AROM was performed and the amniotic fluid was noted to be meconium stained.  After her membranes were ruptured, contractions did increase to every two to three minutes as well as the intensity increased.  She was given Nubain for discomfort with good result.,She had a spontaneous vaginal delivery of a live born female at 11:37 with meconium stained fluid as noted from ROA position.  After controlled delivery of the head, tight nuchal cord was noted, which was quickly double clamped and cut and the shoulders and body were delivered without difficulty.  The infant was taken to the awaiting pediatrician.  Weight was 2870 gm, length was 51 cm.  The Apgars were 6 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes.  There was initial neonatal depression, which was treated by positive pressure ventilation and the administration of Narcan.,Spontaneous delivery of an intact placenta with a three-vessel cord was noted at 11:45.  On examination, there were no noted perineal abrasions or lacerations.  On vaginal exam, there were no noted cervical or vaginal sidewall lacerations.  Estimated blood loss was less than 250 cc.  Mother and infant are in recovery doing well at this time.",1.0
3783,"REASON FOR VISIT: , Mr. ABC is a 30-year-old man who returns in followup of his still moderate-to-severe sleep apnea.  He returns today to review his response to CPAP.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient initially presented with loud obnoxious snoring that disrupted the sleep of his bed partner.  He was found to have moderate-to-severe sleep apnea (predominantly hypopnea), was treated with nasal CPAP at 10 cm H2O nasal pressure.  He has been on CPAP now for several months, and returns for followup to review his response to treatment.,The patient reports that the CPAP has limited his snoring at night.  Occasionally, his bed partner wakes him in the middle of the night, when the mask comes off, and reminds him to replace the mask.  The patient estimates that he uses the CPAP approximately 5 to 7 nights per week, and on occasion takes it off and does not replace the mask when he awakens spontaneously in the middle of the night.,The patient's sleep pattern consists of going to bed between 11:00 and 11:30 at night and awakening between 6 to 7 a.m. on weekdays.  On weekends, he might sleep until 8 to 9 a.m.  On Saturday night, he might go to bed approximately mid night.,As noted, the patient is not snoring on CPAP.  He denies much tossing and turning and does not awaken with the sheets in disarray.  He awakens feeling relatively refreshed.,In the past few months, the patient has lost between 15 and 18 pounds in combination of dietary and exercise measures.,He continues to work at Smith Barney in downtown Baltimore.  He generally works from 8 to 8:30 a.m. until approximately 5 to 5:30 p.m.  He is involved in training purpose to how to sell managed funds and accounts.,The patient reports no change in daytime stamina.  He has no difficulty staying awake during the daytime or evening hours.,The past medical history is notable for allergic rhinitis.,MEDICATIONS: , He is maintained on Flonase and denies much in the way of nasal symptoms.,ALLERGIES: , Molds.,FINDINGS:  ,Vital signs:  Blood pressure 126/75, pulse 67, respiratory rate 16, weight 172 pounds, height 5 feet 9 inches, temperature 98.4 degrees and SaO2 is 99% on room air at rest.,The patient has adenoidal facies as noted previously.,Laboratories:  The patient forgot to bring his smart card in for downloading today.,ASSESSMENT: , Moderate-to-severe sleep apnea.  I have recommended the patient continue CPAP indefinitely.  He will be sending me his smart card for downloading to determine his CPAP usage pattern.  In addition, he will continue efforts to maintain his weight at current levels or below.  Should he succeed in reducing further, we might consider re-running a sleep study to determine whether he still requires a CPAP.,PLANS: , In the meantime, if it is also that the possible nasal obstruction is contributing to snoring and obstructive hypopnea.  I have recommended that a fiberoptic ENT exam be performed to exclude adenoidal tissue that may be contributing to obstruction.  He will be returning for routine followup in 6 months.",2.0
3088,"EXAMINATION: , Cardiac catheterization.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Left heart catheterization, LV cineangiography, selective coronary angiography, and right heart catheterization with cardiac output by thermodilution technique with dual transducer.,INDICATION: , Syncope with severe aortic stenosis.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained from the patient, the patient was brought to the cardiac catheterization laboratory in a post observed state.  The right groin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  After adequate conscious sedation and local anesthesia was obtained, a 6-French sheath was placed in the right common femoral artery and a 8-French sheath was placed in the right common femoral vein.  Following this, a 7.5-French Swan-Ganz catheter was advanced into the right atrium where the right atrial pressure was 10/7 mmHg.  The catheter was then manipulated into the right ventricle where the right ventricular pressure was 37/10/4 mmHg.  The catheter was then manipulated into the wedge position where the wedge pressure was noted to be 22 mmHg.  The pulmonary arterial pressures were noted to be 31/14/21 mmHg.  Following this, the catheter was removed, the sheath was flushed and a 6-French JL4 diagnostic catheter was the advanced over the guidewire and the left main coronary artery was cannulated and selective angiogram was obtained in orthogonal views.  Following this, the catheter was exchanged over the guidewire for 6-French JR4 diagnostic catheter.  We were unable to cannulate the right coronary artery.  Therefore, we exchanged for a Williams posterior catheter and we were able to cannulate the right coronary artery and angiographs were performed in orthogonal views.  Following this, this catheter was exchanged over a guidewire for a 6-French Langston pigtail catheter and the left ventricle was entered and left ventriculography was performed.  Following this, the catheters were removed.  Sheath angiograms revealed the sheath to be in the right common femoral artery and the right common femoral arteriotomy was sealed using a 6-French Angio-Seal device.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no complications.,DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS: , The left main coronary artery is a large vessel, which bifurcates into the left anterior descending artery and left circumflex artery and has moderate diffuse luminal irregularities with no critical lesions.  The left circumflex artery is a short vessel, which gives off one major obtuse marginal artery and has moderate diffuse luminal irregularities with no critical lesions.  The left anterior descending artery has moderate diffuse luminal irregularities and gives off two major diagonal branches.  There is a 70% ostial lesion in the first diagonal branch and the second diagonal branch has mild-to-moderate luminal irregularities.  The right coronary artery is a very large dominant vessel with a 60% to 70% lesion in its descending mid-portion.  The remainder of the vessel has moderate diffuse luminal irregularities with no critical lesions.  The left ventricle appears to be normal sized.  The aortic valve is heavily calcified.  The estimated ejection fraction is approximately 60%.  There was 4+ mitral regurgitation noted.  The mean gradient across the aortic valve was noted to be 33 mmHg yielding an aortic valve area of 0.89 cm2.,CONCLUSION:,1.  Moderate-to-severe coronary artery disease with a high-grade lesion seen at the ostium of the first diagonal artery as well as a 60% to 70% lesion seen at the mid portion of the right coronary artery.,2.  Moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of 0.89 cm2.,3.  4+ mitral regurgitation.,PLAN: , The patient will most likely need a transesophageal echocardiogram to better evaluate the valvular architecture and the patient will be referred to Dr Kenneth Fang for possible aortic valve replacement as well as mitral valve repair/replacement and possible surgical revascularization.",1.0

He passed his fill and pull study and was thought to self-catheterize in the event that he does incur urinary retention again.  We discussed with Mr. Barker that he has a urologist closer to his home and he lives approximately 3 hours away; however, he desires to continue follow up with the urology clinic at MCG and has been set up for followup in 6 weeks.  He was also given a prescription for 6 months of Flomax and Proscar.  He did not have a PSA drawn today as he had a catheter in place, therefore his PSA could be falsely elevated.  He will have PSA level drawn either just before his visit for followup.",1.0

Diagnostic bronchoscopy.,2.  Limited left thoracotomy with partial pulmonary decortication and insertion of chest tubes x2.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:,  After obtaining an informed consent, the patient was taken to the operating room where a time-out process was followed.  Initially, the patient was intubated with a #6 French tube because of the presence of previous laryngectomy.  Because of this, I proceeded to use a pediatric bronchoscope, which provided limited visualization, but I was able to see the trachea and the carina and both left and right bronchial systems without significant pathology, although there was some mucus secretion that was aspirated.,Then, with the patient properly anesthetized and looking very stable, we decided to insert a larger endotracheal tube that allowed for the insertion of the regular adult bronchoscope.  Therefore, we were able to obtain a better visualization and see the trachea and the carina that were normal and also the left and right bronchial systems.  Some brownish secretions were obtained, particularly from the right side and were sent for culture and sensitivity, both aerobic and anaerobic fungi and acid fast.,Then, the patient was turned with left side up and prepped for a left thoracotomy.  He was properly draped.  I had recently re-inspected the CT of the chest and decided to make a limited thoracotomy of about 6 cm or so in the midaxillary line about the sixth intercostal space.  Immediately, it was evident that there was a large amount of pus in the left chest.  We proceeded to insert the suction catheters and we rapidly obtained about 1400 mL of frank pus.  Then, we proceeded to open the intercostal space a bit more with a Richardson retractor and it was immediately obvious that there was an abundant amount of solid exudate throughout the lung.  We spent several minutes trying to clean up this area.  Initially, I had planned only to drain the empyema because the patient was in a very poor condition, but at this particular moment, he was more stable and well oxygenated, and the situation was such that we were able to perform a partial pulmonary decortication where we broke up a number of loculations that were present and we were able to separate the lung from the diaphragm and also the pulmonary fissure.  On the upper part of the chest, we had limited access, but overall we obtained a large amount of solid exudate and we were able to break out loculations.  We followed by irrigation with 2000 cc of warm normal saline and then insertion of two #32 chest tubes, which are the largest one available in this institution; one we put over the diaphragm and the other one going up and down towards the apex.,The limited thoracotomy was closed with heavy intercostal sutures of Vicryl, then interrupted sutures of #0 Vicryl to the muscle layers, and I loosely approximately the skin with a few sutures of nylon because I am suspicious that the incision may become infected because he has been exposed to intrapleural pus.,The chest tubes were secured with sutures and then connected to Pleur-evac.  Then, the patient was transported.,Estimated blood loss was minimal and the patient tolerated the procedure well.

She has been dealing with these symptoms for greater than three months.  She comes to my office with severe pain, left my office and reported to the Emergency Room where she was admitted for pain control one day before surgery.  I have discussed the MRI findings with the patient and the potential risks and complications.  She was scheduled to go to surgery through my office, but because of her severe symptoms, she was unable to keep that appointment and reported right to the Emergency Room.  We discussed the diagnosis and the operative procedure in detail.  I have reviewed the potential risks and complications and she had agreed to proceed with the surgery.  Due to the patient's weight which exceeds 340 lb, there was some concern about her operative table being able to support her weight and also my standard microlumbar discectomy incision is not ________ in this situation just because of the enormous size of the patient's back and abdomen and I have discussed this with her.  She is aware that she will have a much larger incision than what is standard and has agreed to accept this.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to OR #5 at ABCD General Hospital.  While in the hospital gurney, Department of Anesthesia administered general anesthetic, endotracheal intubation was followed.  A Jackson table was prepared for the patient and was reinforced replacing struts under table to prevent the table from collapsing.  The table reportedly does have a limit of 500 lb, but the table has never been stressed above 275 lb.  Once the table was reinforced, the patient was carefully rolled in a prone position on the Jackson table with the bony prominences being well padded.  A marker was placed in from the back at this time and an x-ray was obtained for incision localization.  The back is now prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A midline incision was made over the L5-S1 disc space taking through subcutaneous tissue sharply with a #10 Bard-Parker scalpel.  The lumbar dorsal fascia was then encountered and incised to the left of midline.  In the subperiosteal fashion, the musculature was elevated off the lamina at L5 and S1 after facet joint, but not disturbing the capsule.  A second marker was now placed and an intraoperative x-ray confirms our location at the L5-S1 disc space.  The microscope was brought into the field at this point and the remainder of the procedure done with microscopic visualization and illumination.  A high speed drill was used to perform a laminotomy by removing small portion of the superior edge of the S1 lamina and the inferior edge of the L5 lamina.  Ligaments and fragments were encountered and removed at this time.  The epidural space was now encountered.  The S1 nerve root was now visualized and found to be displaced dorsally as a result of a large disc herniation while the nerve was carefully protected with a Penfield.  A small stab incision was made into the disc fragment and probably a large portion of disc extrudes from the opening.  This disc fragment was removed and the nerve root was much more supple, it was carefully retracted.  The nerve root was now retracted and using a series of downgoing curettes, additional disc material was removed from around the disc space and from behind the body of S1 and L5.  At this point, all disc fragments were removed from the epidural space.  Murphy ball was passed anterior to the thecal sac in the epidural space and there was no additional compression that I can identify.  The disc space was now encountered and loose disc fragments were removed from within the disc space.  The disc space was then irrigated.  The nerve root was then reassessed and found to be quite supple.  At this point, the Murphy ball was passed into the foramen of L5 and this was patent and also into the foramen of S1 by passing ventral and dorsal to the nerve root and there were no obstructions in the passage of the device.  At this point, the wound was irrigated copiously and suctioned dry.  Gelfoam was used to cover the epidural space.  The retractors were removed at this point.  The fascia was reapproximated with #1 Vicryl suture, subcutaneous tissue with #2-0 Vicryl suture and Steri-Strips for curved incision.  The patient was transferred to the hospital gurney in supine position and extubated by Anesthesia, subsequently transferred to Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable condition.",1.0

She reports that it is painful to palpation on the right and has had multiple CT scans as well as an FNA which were all nondiagnostic.  After risks and benefits of surgery were discussed with the patient, an informed consent was obtained.  She was scheduled for an excisional biopsy of the right cervical lymph node.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  She was anesthetized with general endotracheal anesthesia.  The neck was then prepped and draped in the sterile fashion.  Again, noted on palpation there was an enlarged level 2 cervical lymph node.,A 3-cm horizontal incision was made over this lymph node.  Dissection was carried down until the sternocleidomastoid muscle was identified.  The enlarged lymph node that measured approximately 2 cm in diameter was identified and was removed and sent to Pathology for touch prep evaluation.  The area was then explored for any other enlarged lymph nodes.  None were identified, and hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery.  A quarter-inch Penrose drain was placed in the wound.,The wound was then irrigated and closed with 3-0 interrupted Vicryl sutures for a deep closure followed by a running 4-0 Prolene subcuticular suture.

There was no adenoid specimen.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,HISTORY: , The patient is a 9-year-old Caucasian male with history of recurrent episodes of adenotonsillitis that has been refractory to outpatient antibiotic therapy.  The patient has had approximately four to five episodes of adenotonsillitis per year for the last three to four years.,PROCEDURE: , Informed consent was properly obtained from the patient's parents and the patient was taken to the operating room #3 and was placed in a supine position.  He was placed under general endotracheal tube anesthesia by the Department of Anesthesia.  The bed was then rolled away from Department of Anesthesia.  A shoulder roll was then placed beneath the shoulder blades and a blue towel was then fashioned as a turban wrap.  The McIvor mouth gag was carefully positioned into the patient's mouth with attention to avoid the teeth.,The retractor was then opened and the oropharynx was visualized.  The adenoid pad was then visualized with a laryngeal mirror.  The adenoids appeared to be 1+ and non-obstructing.  There was no evidence of submucosal cleft palate palpable.  There was no evidence of bifid uvula.  A curved Allis clamp was then used to grasp the superior pole of the right tonsil.  The tonsil was then retracted inferiorly and medially.  Bovie cautery was used to make an incision on the mucosa of the right anterior tonsillar pillar to find the appropriate plane of dissection.  The tonsil was then dissected out within this plane using a Bovie.  Tonsillar sponge was re-applied to the tonsillar fossa.  Suction cautery was then used to adequately obtain hemostasis with the tonsillar fossa.  Attention was then directed to the left tonsil.  The curved Allis was used to grasp the superior pole of the left tonsil and it was retracted inferiorly and medially.  Bovie cautery was used to make an incision in the mucosa of the left anterior tonsillar pillar and define the appropriate plane of dissection.  The tonsil was then dissected out within this plane using the Bovie.  Next, complete hemostasis was achieved within the tonsillar fossae using suction cautery.  After adequate hemostasis was obtained, attention was directed towards the adenoid pad.  The adenoid pad was again visualized and appeared 1+ and was non-obstructing.  Decision was made to use suction cautery to cauterize the adenoids.  Using a laryngeal mirror under direct visualization, the adenoid pad was then cauterized with care to avoid the eustachian tube orifices as well as the soft palate and inferior turbinates.  After cauterization was complete, the nasopharynx was again visualized and tonsillar sponge was applied.  Adequate hemostasis was achieved.  The tonsillar fossae were again visualized and no evidence of bleeding was evident.  The throat pack was removed from the oropharynx and the oropharynx was suctioned.  There was no evidence of any further bleeding.  A flexible suction catheter was then used to suction out the nasopharynx to the oropharynx.  The suction catheter was also used to suction up the stomach.  Final look revealed no evidence of further bleeding and 10 mg of Decadron was given intraoperatively.,DISPOSITION:  ,The patient tolerated the procedure well and the patient was transported to the recovery room in stable condition.",2.0
2768,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION:,  Metastatic ovarian cancer.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , Mrs. ABCD is a very nice 66-year-old woman who is followed in clinic by Dr. X for history of renal cell cancer, breast cancer, as well as ovarian cancer, which was initially diagnosed 10 years ago, but over the last several months has recurred and is now metastatic.  She last saw Dr. X in clinic towards the beginning of this month.  She has been receiving gemcitabine and carboplatin, and she receives three cycles of this with the last one being given on 12/15/08.  She was last seen in clinic on 12/22/08 by Dr. Y.  At that point, her white count was 0.9 with the hemoglobin of 10.3, hematocrit of 30%, and platelets of 81,000.  Her ANC was 0.5.  She was started on prophylactic Augmentin as well as Neupogen shots.  She has also had history of recurrent pleural effusions with the knee for thoracentesis.  She had two of these performed in November and the last one was done about a week ago.,Over the last 2 or 3 days, she states she has been getting more short of breath.  Her history is somewhat limited today as she is very tired and falls asleep readily.  Her history comes from herself but also from the review of the records.  Overall, her shortness of breath has been going on for the past few weeks related to her pleural effusions.  She was seen in the emergency room this time and on chest x-ray was found to have a new right-sided pulmonic consolidative infiltrate, which was felt to be possibly related to pneumonia.  She specifically denied any fevers or chills.  However, she was complaining of chest pain.  She states that the chest pain was located in the substernal area, described as aching, coming and going and associated with shortness of breath and cough.  When she did cough, it was nonproductive.  While in the emergency room on examination, her vital signs were stable except that she required 5 liters nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturations.  An EKG was performed, which showed sinus rhythm without any evidence of Q waves or other ischemic changes.  The chest x-ray described above showed a right lower lobe infiltrate.  A V/Q scan was done, which showed a small mismatched defect in the left upper lobe and a mass defect in the right upper lobe.  The findings were compatible with an indeterminate study for a pulmonary embolism.  Apparently, an ultrasound of the lower extremities was done and was negative for DVT.  There was apparently still some concern that this might be pulmonary embolism and she was started on Lovenox.  There was also concern for pneumonia and she was started on Zosyn as well as vancomycin and admitted to the hospital.,At this point, we have been consulted to help follow along with this patient who is well known to our clinic.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY,1.

She was evaluated and found to have a CT evidence of appendicitis.  She was subsequently consented for a laparoscopic appendectomy.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room, placed supine on the table.  The abdomen was prepared and draped in usual sterile fashion.  After the induction of satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia, supraumbilical incision was made.  A Veress needle was inserted.  Abdomen was insufflated to 15 mmHg.  A 5-mm port and camera placed.  The abdomen was visually explored.  There were no obvious abnormalities.  A 15-mm port was placed in the suprapubic position in addition of 5 mm was placed in between the 1st two.  Blunt dissection was used to isolate the appendix.  Appendix was separated from surrounding structures.  A window was created between the appendix and the mesoappendix.  GIA stapler was tossed across it and fired.  Mesoappendix was then taken with 2 fires of the vascular load on the GIA stapler.  Appendix was placed in an Endobag and removed from the patient.  Right lower quadrant was copiously irrigated.  All irrigation fluids were removed.  Hemostasis was verified.  The 15-mm port was removed and the port site closed with 0-Vicryl in the Endoclose device.  All other ports were irrigated, infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine and closed with 4-0 Vicryl subcuticular sutures.  Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied.

He sustained a blunt trauma to his ribs resulting in multiple fractures and presumably also struck his mandible resulting in the above-mentioned fracture.  He was admitted to hospital in Harleton, Texas, where his initial evaluation showed the rib fractures have also showed a nodule on his right upper lobe as well as a mediastinal mass.  His mandible fracture was not noted initially.  The patient also has a history of prostate cancer and a renal cell carcinoma.  The patient at that point underwent a bronchoscopy with a biopsy of the mediastinal mass and the results of that biopsy are still pending.  The patient later saw a local oral surgeon.  He diagnosed his mandible fracture and advised him to seek treatment in Houston.  He presented to my office for evaluation on January 18, 2010, and he was found to have an extremely atrophic mandible with a fracture in the left parasymphysis region involving a failed dental implant, which had been placed approximately 15 years ago.  The patient had significant discomfort and could eat foods and drink fluids with difficulty.  Due to the nature of his fracture and the complex medical history, he was sent to the hospital for admission and following cardiac clearance, he was scheduled for surgery today.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room, and placed in a supine position.  Following a nasal intubation and induction of general anesthesia, the surgeon then scrubbed, gowned, and gloved in the normal sterile fashion.  The patient was then prepped and draped in a manner consistent with sterile procedures.  A marking pen was first used to outline the incision in the submental region and it was extended from the left mandibular body to the right mandibular body region, approximately 1.5 cm medial to the inferior border of the mandible.  A 1 mL of lidocaine 1% with 1:100,000 epinephrine was then infiltrated along the incision and then a 15-blade was used to incise through the skin and subcutaneous tissue.  A combination of sharp and blunt dissection was then used to carry the dissection superiorly to the inferior border of the mandible.  Electrocautery as well as 4.0 silk ties were used for hemostasis.  A 15-blade was then used to incise the periosteum along the inferior border of the mandible and it was reflected exposing the mandible as well as the fracture site.  The fracture site was slightly distracted allowing access to the dental implant within the bone and it was easily removed from the wound.  Cultures of this site were also obtained and then the granulation tissue from the wound was also curetted free of the wound and sent for a histologic diagnosis.  Manipulation of the mandible was then used to achieve an anatomic reduction and then an 11-hole Synthes reconstruction plate was then used to stand on the fracture site.  Since there was an area of weakness in the right parasymphysis region, in the location of another dental implant, the bone plate was extended posterior to that site.  When the plate was adapted to the mandible, it was then secured to the bone with 9 screws, each being 2 mm in diameter and each screw was placed bicortically.  All the screws were also locking screws.  Following placement of the screws, there was felt to be excellent stability of the fracture, so the wound was irrigated with a copious amount of normal saline.  The incision was closed in multiple layers with 4.0 Vicryl in the muscular and subcutaneous layers and 5.0 nylon in the skin.  A sterile dressing was then placed over the incision.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the recovery room with spontaneous respirations and stable vital signs.  Estimated blood loss is 125 mL.",1.0

4162,"HISTORY OF PRESENT PROBLEM:,  XYZ was seen by Dr. ABC for an FCR tendinitis.  We do not have his reports, but by history she has had two cortisone shots.  She plays musical instruments, and it does bother her from time to time.  She was considering surgery, but she takes ibuprofen and it seems to be well-controlled.  She is here now for consultation. ,CLINICAL/PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , ,General:  The patient is alert and oriented times three in no acute distress. ,Skin:  No skin breakdown or hyperhidrosis.,Vascular:  2+ radial and ulnar artery pulses.,Musculoskeletal:  Wrist, elbow, shoulder and neck exams reveal no focal findings except for some tenderness to palpation over the FCR tendon on the scaphoid tubercle, but there is no SL instability and no signs of lunotriquetral instability or midcarpal instability.  The DRUJ is stable.  Flexion/extension of the fingers is all intact.  Forearm, elbow and shoulder exams reveal no other focal tenderness to palpation.,Neurologic:  Negative Tinel's, Phalen's and compression median nerve test.  APB, EPL and first dorsal interosseous have 5/5 strength.  Forearm, elbow and shoulder exams reveal no neurologic compromise.,Gait:  Normal.,Neck:  Negative Spurling sign.  Negative signs of thoracic outlet.,HEENT:  Pupils equal and reactive with no asymmetry.,CLINICAL IMPRESSION:,  By history, possible FCR tendinitis.,EVALUATION/TREATMENT PLAN:  At this point, we have asked her some questions again.  She is not that sore at this point, and she has had a couple of cortisone shots.  Without being the initial treating physician, she has FCR tendinitis that fails to respond to cortisone shots.  She is a candidate for an FCR tunnel release.  It has been described and is effective for those patients with that problem.  My only consideration would be, if the patient should choose, to get an MRI when she is symptomatic to confirm the FCR tendinitis.  She will followup with Dr. ABC as needed or come back to us when she is thinking more along the lines of surgery.",2.0

Transcatheter infusion of papaverine.,ANESTHESIA: , General anesthesia,FLUORO TIME: , 19.5 minutes,CONTRAST:,  Visipaque-270, 100 mL,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , The patient is a 13-year-old boy who had clipping for a left ICA bifurcation aneurysm.  He was referred for a routine postop check angiogram.  He is doing fine clinically.  All questions were answered, risks explained, informed consent taken and patient was brought to angio suite.,TECHNIQUE: , After informed consent was taken patient was brought to angio suite, both groin sites were prepped and draped in sterile manner.  Patient was placed under general anesthesia for entire duration of the procedure.  Groin access was obtained with a stiff micropuncture wire and a 4-French sheath was placed in the right common femoral artery and connected to a continuous heparinized saline flush.  A 4-French angled Glide catheter was then taken up into the descending thoracic aorta was double flushed and connected to a continuous heparinized saline flush.  The catheter was then taken up into the aortic arch and both common and internal carotid arteries were selectively catheterized followed by digital subtraction imaging in multiple projections.  The images showed spasm of the left internal carotid artery and the left A1, it was thought planned to infused papaverine into the ICA and the left A1.  After that the diagnostic catheter was taken up into the distal internal carotid artery.  SL-10 microcatheter was then prepped and was taken up with the support of Transcend platinum micro guide wire.  The microcatheter was then taken up into the internal carotid artery under biplane roadmapping and was taken up into the distal internal carotid artery and was pointed towards the A1.  60 mg of papaverine was then slowly infused into the internal carotid artery and the anterior cerebral artery.  Post-papaverine infusion images showed increased caliber of the internal carotid artery as well as the left A1.  The catheter was then removed from the patient, pressure was held for 10 minutes leading to hemostasis.  Patient was then transferred back to the ICU in the Children's Hospital where he was extubated without any deficits.,INTERPRETATION OF IMAGES:,1.  LEFT COMMON/INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY INJECTIONS:  The left internal carotid artery is of normal caliber.  In the intracranial projection there is moderate spasm of the left internal carotid artery and moderately severe spasm of the left A1.  There is poor filling of the A2 through left internal carotid artery injection.  There is opacification of the ophthalmic and the posterior communicating artery MCA along with the distal branches are filling normally.  Capillary filling and venous drainage in MCA distribution is normal and it is very slow in the ACA distribution,2.  RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY INJECTION:  The right internal carotid artery is of normal caliber.  There is opacification of the right ophthalmic and the posterior communicating artery.  The right ACA A1 is supplying bilateral A2 and there is no spasm of the distal anterior cerebral artery.  Right MCA along with the distal branches are filling normally.  Capillary filling and venous drainage are normal.,3.

223,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Bilateral progressive conductive hearing losses with probable otosclerosis.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Bilateral conductive hearing losses with right stapedial fixation secondary to otosclerosis.,OPERATION PERFORMED: , Right argon laser assisted stapedectomy.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room.  Endotracheal intubation carried out by Dr. X. The patient's right ear was carefully prepped and then draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Slow infiltration of the external canal accomplished with 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine.  The earlobe was also infiltrated with the same solution.  A limited incision was made in the earlobe harvesting a small bit of fat from the earlobe that was diced and the donor site closed with interrupted sutures of 5-0 nylon.  This could later be removed in bishop.  A reinspection of the ear canal was accomplished.  A 65 Beaver blade was used to make incision both at 12 o'clock and at 6 o'clock.  Jordan round knife was used to incise the tympanomeatal flap with an adequate cuff for later reapproximation.  Elevation was carried down to the fibrous annulus.  An annulus elevator was used to complete the elevation beneath the annular ligament.  The tympanic membrane and the associated flap rotated anteriorly exposing the ossicular chain.  Palpation of the malleus revealed good mobility of both it and incus, but no movement of the stapes was identified.  Palpation with a fine curved needle on the stapes itself revealed no movement.  A house curette was used to takedown portions of the scutum with extreme care to avoid any inadvertent trauma to the chorda tympani.  The nerve was later hydrated with a small curved needle and an additional fluid to try to avoid inadvertent desiccation of it as well.  The self-retaining speculum holder was used to get secure visibility and argon laser then used to create rosette on the posterior cruse.  The stapes superstructure anteriorly was mobilized with a right angle hook at the incostapedial joint and the superstructure could then be downfractured.  The fenestration created in the footplate was nearly perfect for placement of the piston and therefore additional laser vaporization was not required in this particular situation.  A small bit of additional footplate was removed with a right angle hook to accommodate the 0.6 mm piston.  The measuring device was used and a 4.25 mm slim shaft wire Teflon piston chosen.  It was placed in the middle ear atraumatically with a small alligator forceps and was directed towards the fenestration in the footplate.  The hook was placed over the incus and measurement appeared to be appropriate.  A downbiting crimper was then used to complete the attachment of the prosthesis to the incus.  Prosthesis is once again checked for location and centering and appeared to be in ideal position.  Small pledgets of fat were placed around the perimeter of the piston in an attempt to avoid any postoperative drainage of perilymph.  A small pledget of fat was also placed on the top of the incudo-prosthesis junction.  The mobility appeared excellent.  The flap was placed back in its normal anatomic position.  The external canal packed with small pledgets of Gelfoam and antibiotic ointment.  She was then awakened and taken to the recovery room in a stable condition with discharge anticipated later this day to Bishop.  Sutures will be out in a week and a recheck in Reno in four to five weeks from now.",2.0

Next the neck, chest and legs were prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  We used a #10-blade scalpel to make a midline median sternotomy incision.  Dissection was carried down to the left of the sternum using Bovie electrocautery.  The sternum was opened with a sternal saw.  The chest retractor was positioned.  Next, full-dose heparin was given.  The pericardium was opened.  Pericardial stay sutures were positioned.  After obtaining adequate ACT, we prepared to place the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass.  A 2-0 double pursestring of Ethibond suture was placed in the ascending aorta.  Through this was passed an aortic cannula connected to the arterial side of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine.  Next a 3-0 Prolene pursestring was placed in the right atrial appendage.  Through this was passed our venous cannula connected to the venous portion of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine.  A 4-0 U-stitch was placed in the right atrium.  A retrograde cardioplegia catheter was positioned at this site.  Next, scissors were used to dissect out the right upper pulmonary vein.  A 4-0 Prolene pursestring was placed in the right upper pulmonary vein.  Next, a right-angle sump was placed at this position.  We then connected our retrograde cardioplegia catheter to the cardioplegia solution circuit.  Bovie electrocautery was used to dissect the interface between the aorta and pulmonary artery.  The aorta was completely encircled.  Next, an antegrade cardioplegia needle and associated sump were placed in the ascending aorta.  We then prepared to cross-clamp the aorta.  We went down on our flows and cross-clamped the aorta.  We backed up our flows.  We then gave antegrade and retrograde cold blood cardioplegia solution circuit so as to arrest the heart.  The patient had some aortic insufficiency so we elected, after initially arresting the heart, to open the aorta and transect it and then give direct ostial infusion of cardioplegia solution circuit.  Next, after obtaining complete diastolic arrest of the heart, we turned our attention to exposing the aortic valve, and 4-0 Tycron sutures were placed in the commissures.  In addition, a 2-0 Prolene suture was placed in the aortic wall so as to bring the aortic wall and root up into view.  Next, scissors were used to excise the diseased aortic valve leaflets.  Care was taken to remove all the calcium from the aortic annulus.  We then sized up the aortic annulus which came out to be a **-mm stentless porcine Toronto valve.  We prepared the valve.  Next, we placed our proximal suture line of interrupted 4-0 Tycron sutures for the annulus.  We started with our individual commissural stitches.  They were connected to our valve sewing ring.  Next, we placed 5 interrupted 4-0 Tycron sutures in a subannular fashion at each commissural position.  After doing so, we passed 1 end of the suture through the sewing portion of the Toronto stentless porcine valve.  The valve was lowered into place and all of the sutures were tied.  Next, we gave another round of cold blood antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia.  Next, we sewed our distal suture line.  We began with the left coronary cusp of the valve.  We ran a 5-0 RB needle up both sides of the valve.  Care was taken to avoid the left coronary ostia.  This procedure was repeated on the right cusp of the stentless porcine valve.  Again, care was taken to avoid any injury to the coronary ostia.  Lastly, we sewed our non-coronary cusp.  This was done without difficulty.  At this point we inspected our aortic valve.  There was good coaptation of the leaflets, and it was noted that both the left and the right coronary ostia were open.  We gave another round of cold blood antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia.  The antegrade portion was given in a direct ostial fashion once again.  We now turned our attention to closing the aorta.  A 4-0 Prolene double row of suture was used to close the aorta in a running fashion.  Just prior to closing, we de-aired the heart and gave a warm shot of antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia.  At this point, we removed our aortic cross-clamp.  The heart gradually regained its electromechanical activity.  We placed 2 atrial and 2 ventricular pacing wires.  We removed our aortic vent and oversewed that site with another 4-0 Prolene on an SH needle.  We removed our retrograde cardioplegia catheter.  We oversewed that site with a 5-0 Prolene.  By now, the heart was de-aired and resumed normal electromechanical activity.  We began to wean the patient from cardiopulmonary bypass.  We then removed our venous cannula and suture ligated that site with a #2 silk.  We then gave full-dose protamine.  After knowing that there was no evidence of a protamine reaction, we removed the aortic cannula.  We buttressed that site with a 4-0 Prolene on an SH needle.  We placed a mediastinal chest tube and brought it out through the skin.  We also placed 2 Blake drains, 1 in the left chest and 1 in the right chest, as the patient had some bilateral pleural effusions.  They were brought out through the skin.  The sternum was closed with #7 wires in an interrupted figure-of-eight fashion.  The fascia was closed with #1 Vicryl.  We closed the subcu tissue with 2-0 Vicryl and the skin with 4-0 PDS.",2.0

Lidocaine 1.5% for skin wheal was made 10 cm from the midline to the bilateral L2 distal vertebral body.  A 20-gauge, 15 cm SMK needle was then directed using AP and fluoroscopic guidance so that the tip of the needle was noted to be along the distal one-third and anterior border on the lateral view and on the AP view the tip of the needle was inside the lateral third of the border of the vertebral body.  At this time a negative motor stimulation was obtained.  Injection of 10 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plus 10 mg of Depo-Medrol was performed. Coagulation was then carried out for 90oC for 90 seconds.  At the conclusion of this, the needle under fluoroscopic guidance was withdrawn approximately 5 mm where again a negative motor stimulation was obtained and the sequence of injection and coagulation was repeated.  This was repeated one more time with a 5 mm withdrawal and coagulation.,At that time, attention was directed to the L3 body where the needle was placed to the upper one-third/distal two-thirds junction and the sequence of injection, coagulation, and negative motor stimulation with needle withdrawal one time of a 5 mm distance was repeated.

2456,"OTITIS MEDIA, is an infection of the middle ear space where the small bones and nerves of the ear connect to the eardrum on one side and the eustachian tube on the other.  The ear infection itself is not contagious but the respiratory infection preceding it is transmittable.  Otitis media is most often seen in infants and young children.  There are several causes including a viral or bacterial infection that spreads to the middle ear by way of the eustachian tubes, nasal allergy drainage blocking the sinuses or eustachian tubes, enlarged adenoids also blocking sinuses or eustachian tubes and eardrum rupture.  Many factors can increase the risk of an ear infection like recent upper respiratory tract illness, crowded living conditions, family history of ear infections, day care, smoking in household, altitude changes, cold weather and genetic factors.,SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS:,*  Irritability.,*  Ear pain, fullness, hearing loss.,*  Infants may pull on ear.,*  Fever.,*  Vomiting.,*  Discharge from ear.,*  Diarrhea.,TREATMENT:,*  Diagnosis is by physical exam and otoscopic exam.  Sometimes fluid from the ear is cultured.,*  Pain relievers, like acetaminophen (Tylenol).  Infant pain relievers are available.,*  Decongestant to relieve symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection.,*  Antibiotics when indicated for bacterial infection such as Amoxicillin or Zithromycin.  Finish ALL antibiotics as prescribed.  Do not stop the medication even if symptoms subside.,*  Avoid swimming until infection goes away.,*  Surgery is sometimes necessary to put in tubes through the eardrum to equalize pressure and drain fluids.,*  Surgery to remove adenoids if they are enlarged.,*  Reduce activity until symptoms subside.,Call doctor's office if symptoms do not improve within 2 days of treatment, and for convulsion, fever, ear swelling, dizziness, twitching facial muscles and severe headache.",1.0

3361,"REASON FOR REFERRAL: , The patient was referred to me by Dr. X of the Hospitalist Service at Children's Hospital due to a recent admission for pseudoseizures.  This was a 90-minute initial intake completed on 10/19/2007 with the patient's mother.  I have reviewed with her the boundaries of confidentiality and the treatment consent form, and she stated that she had understood these concepts.,PRESENTING PROBLEM: , It is reported that the patient was recently hospitalized and has been hospitalized in 2 occasions for pseudoseizure activity.  These were confirmed by video EEG and consist of trembling, shaking, and things of that nature.  She does have a history of focal seizures and perhaps simple seizures, which were diagnosed when she was 5 years old, but the seizure activity that was documented during the hospital stay is of a significant different quality.  I had met with them in the hospital and introduced myself and gathered some basic background information, but this is a supplement to that information, which is contained within this chart.  It was reported to me that she has been under considerable stress.  First of all, it should be noted that the patient is developmentally delayed.  Although she is 17 years old, she operates at about a fourth grade level.  Mother reported that The patient becomes stressed because she thinks that everyone is against her, that she cannot do anything unless someone is there, that she needs a lot of direction, that she gets confused easily, that she thinks that people become angry at her, that she misinterprets what people are saying and thinks that they are upset.  It is reported, the patient feels that her mother yells at her, and that is mad at her often.  It was reported that in addition she recently has had change in her visitation with her father, that she within the last 6 months, has started seeing her father every other weekend after he had been discharged from prison.  She reported that what is stress for her is that sometimes he does not always show up for visits or is late and that upsets her a lot and that she is upset when she has to leave him, also additional stressor is at school.  She reports that she has no friends that she feels unwanted and picked on.  She gets confused easily at school, worries about things, and believes that the teachers become angry with her.  In regards to her mood, mother reported that she is usually happy, unless things do not go her way, and then, she becomes upset and says that nobody cares about her.  She sits in the couch, she become angry, does not speak.  Mother sends her to her room, and she calms down, takes a couple of deep breaths, and that passes.  It is reported that the patient has ""always been this way"" and that is not a change in her behavior.  Mother did think that she did seem a little more depressed, that she seems more lonely.  Over the last few months, she has seemed a little bit more down because she does not have any friends and that she is bored.  Mother reported that she frequently complains of being bored, but has always been this way.  No sleep disturbance was noted.  No changes in weight.  No suicidal ideation.  No deficits in energy were noted.  Mother did report that she does tend to worry, but her worries tend to be because she gets confused, does not understand what she needs to do, and is quite rigid, but mother did not feel that the worry was actually affecting her functioning on a daily basis.,DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY:,  The patient was the 5 pound 12 ounce product of an unplanned pregnancy and normal spontaneous vaginal delivery.  She was delivered at 36 weeks' gestation.  Mother reported that she received prenatal care.  Difficulties during the pregnancy were denied.  The use of drugs, alcohol, tobacco during the pregnancy were denied.  No eating or sleeping difficulties during the perinatal period were reported.  Temperament was described as easy.  The patient is described as a cuddly baby.  In terms of serious injuries, they were denied.  Serious illnesses:  She has been diagnosed since age 5 with seizures.  Mother was not able to tell me the exact kind of seizures, but it would appear from I could gather that they are focal seizures and possibly simple-to-complex partial seizures.  The patient does not have a history of allergy or toileting problems.  She is currently taking Trileptal 450 mg b.i.d., and she is currently taking Depakote, although she is going to be weaned off the Depakote by her neurologist.  She is taking Prevacid and ibuprofen.  The neurologist that she sees is Dr. Y here at Children's Hospital.,FAMILY BACKGROUND:,  In terms of family background, the patient lives with her mother age 38 and her mother's partner, who is age 40, and with her 16-year-old sister who does not have any developmental delays.  Mother had been married to the patient's father, but they were together as a couple beginning 1990, married in 1997, separated in 2002, and divorced in 2003; he lives in the ABC area and visits them every other Saturday, but there are no overnight visits.

Mother's partner had been married previously; he has 2 children from that relationship, a 23-year-old, and a 20-year-old female, who really are not part of the patient's daily life.  In terms of other family background, it was reported that the mother's partner gets frustrated with The patient, does not completely understand the degree of her delay and how that may affect her ability to do things as well as her interpretation of things.  The sister was described as having some resentment towards her older sister, that she feels like she was just to watch out for her, care for her, and that sister has always wanted to follow her around and do the things that she does.  The biological father allegedly was in jail for a year due to drug possession.  Mother reported that he had a problem with methamphetamine.  In addition, she reported there is an accusation that he had molested their niece; however, she stated that there was a trial, and he was found to be not guilty of that.  She stated there was no evidence that he had ever molested the patient or her sister.  There had been quite a bit of chaos in the family when the mother and father were together.  There was a lot of arguing.  There were a lot of moves, there was domestic violence both from father to mother and mother to father consisting mostly of pushing and shoving by mother's report.  The patient did observe this.  After the separation, it was reported that there were continued difficulties that the father took the patient and her sister from school without mother's knowledge and had filed to get custody of them and actually ended up having custody of them for a month, and told the patient and her sister that the mother had abandoned them.  Mother reported that they went to court, and there was a court order giving the mother custody back after the father went to jail.  Mother stated that was approximately 5 years ago.  In terms of current, mother reports that she currently works 2 jobs from 8 to 5 on Monday and Friday and from 6 to 10 on Monday, Wednesday's, and Friday's, but she does have the weekends off.  The patient was reported also to have a job through her school on several weeknights.,Mother reported that she graduated from high school, had a year of college.  She was an average student, had learning difficulties in reading.  No psychological or drug or alcohol history was reported by mother.  In terms of the biological father, mother stated that he graduated from high school, had a couple of years of college, was a good student, no learning problems or psychological problems for him were reported.  Mother reported that he had a history of methamphetamine use.,Other psychiatric history in the family was denied.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , She reported that the patient feels like she does not have any friends, that she is lonely and bored, really does not do much for fun.  Her fun consists primarily of doing crafts with mother, sewing, painting, drawing, beadwork, and things like that.  It was reported that she really feels that she is bored and does not have much to do.,ACADEMIC BACKGROUND:  ,The patient is in the 11th grade at High School.  She has 2 regular education classes, mother could not tell me what they were, but the rest of her classes are special education.  Mother could not tell me what her IQ was, although she noticed she works at about a 4th or 5th grade level.  Mother reported that the terminology most often used with the patient was developmental delay.  Her counselor's name is Mr. XYZ, but she reported that overall she is a good student, but she does have sometimes some difficulties at school, becoming upset or angry regarding the little things that she does not seem to understand.  It is reported that the patient feels that she has no friends at school that she is lonely, and that is she does not really care for school.  She reported that the patient is involved in a work program through the school where she works at Pet Extreme on Mondays and Wednesdays from 3 to 8 p.m. where she stocks shelves.  It is reported that she does not like to go to school because she feels like nobody likes her.  She is not involved in any kind of clubs or groups at school.  Mother reported that she is also not receiving CVRC services.,PREVIOUS COUNSELING: , Mother reported that she has been in counseling before, but mother could not give me any information about that, who did the counseling, or what it was about.  She does receive evidently some peer counseling at school because she gets upset and needs help in calming down.,DIAGNOSTIC SUMMARY AND IMPRESSION:,  It appears that the patient best qualifies for a diagnosis of conversion disorder, and information from Neurology suggests that the ""seizure episodes"" are not true seizures, but appear to be pseudoseizures.  The patient is experiencing quite bit of stress with a lot of changes in her life, also difficulty in functioning likely due to her developmental delay makes it difficult for her to understand.,PLAN:,  My plan is to meet with the patient in approximately 1 to 2 weeks to complete a clinical interview with her, and then to begin teaching coping skills as well as explore ways for reducing her stress.,DSM IV DIAGNOSES:  ,AXIS I:  Conversion disorder (300.11).,AXIS II:  Diagnoses deferred.,AXIS III:  Seizure disorder.,AXIS IV:  Problems with primary support group, peer problems, and educational problems.,AXIS V:  Global assessment of functioning equals 60.",2.0

The x-ray technician was supervised and instructed to operate the fluoroscopy machine.  The patient was placed in the prone position on the treatment table with a pillow under the abdomen to reduce the natural lumbar lordosis.  The skin over and surrounding the treatment area was cleaned with Betadine.  The area was covered with sterile drapes, leaving a small window opening for needle placement.  Fluoroscopy was used to identify the boney landmarks of the spine and the planned needle approach.  The skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle within the planned approach were anesthetized with 1% Lidocaine.  With fluoroscopy, a Teflon coated needle, ***, was gently guided into the region of the Medial Branch nerves from the Dorsal Ramus of ***.  Specifically, each needle tip was inserted to the bone at the groove between the transverse process and superior articular process on lumbar vertebra, or for sacral vertebrae at the lateral-superior border of the posterior sacral foramen.  Needle localization was confirmed with AP and lateral radiographs.,The following technique was used to confirm placement at the Medial Branch nerves.  Sensory stimulation was applied to each level at 50 Hz; paresthesias were noted at,*** volts.  Motor stimulation was applied at 2 Hz with 1 millisecond duration; corresponding paraspinal muscle twitching without extremity movement was noted at *** volts.,Following this, the needle Trocar was removed and a syringe containing 1% lidocaine was attached.  At each level, after syringe aspiration with no blood return, 1cc 1% lidocaine was injected to anesthetize the Medial Branch nerve and surrounding tissue.

There is also evidence of bilateral internal as well as external nasal valve collapse.,INDICATIONS:  ,The patient is a pleasant 49-year-old gentleman who had undergone a previous septorhinoplasty after significant trauma in his 20s.  He now presents with significant upper airway resistance and nasal obstruction and is unable to tolerate a CPAP machine.  Therefore, for repair of the above-mentioned deformities including the internal and external nasal valve collapse as well as straightening of the deviated septum, the risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with him included but not limited to bleeding, infection, septal perforation, need for further surgeries, external deformity, and he desired to proceed with surgery.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room and laid supine upon the OR table.  After the induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, the nose was decongested using Afrin-soaked pledgets followed by the injection of % lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine in the submucoperichondrial planes bilaterally.  Examination revealed significant deviation of the nasal septum and the bony cartilaginous junction as well as the large septal spur along the floor.  The caudal septum appeared to be now in adequate position.  There was evidence that there had been a previous caudal septal graft on the right nares and it was decided to leave this in place.  Following the evaluation of the nose, a hemitransfixion incision was made on the left revealing a large septal spur consisting primarily down on the floor of the left nostril creating nearly a picture of the vestibular stenosis on the side.  Very carefully, the mucoperichondrial flaps were elevated over this, and it was excised using an osteotome taking care to preserve the 1.5 cm dorsal and caudal strap of the nasal septum and keep it attached to the nasal spine.  Very carefully, the bony cartilaginous junction was identified and a small piece of the bone, where the spur was, was carefully removed.  Following this, it was noted that the cartilaginous region was satisfactory in quantity as well as quality to perform adequate grafting procedures.  Therefore, attention was turned to harvesting the right-sided auricular cartilage, which was done after the region had adequately been prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  Postauricular incision using a #15 blade, the area of the submucoperichondrial plane was elevated in order to preserve the nice lining and identifiable portion of the cartilage taking care to preserve the ridge of the helix at all times.  This was very carefully harvested.  This area had been injected previously with 1% lidocaine and 1:100,000 epinephrine.  Following this, the cartilage was removed.  It was placed in saline, noted to be fashioned in the bilateral spreader graft and alar rim graft as well as a small piece of crush which was used to be placed along the top of the dorsal irregularity.  The spreader grafts were sutured in place using submucoperichondrial pockets.  After an external septorhinoplasty approach had been performed and reflection of the skin and soft tissue envelope had been performed, adequately revealing straight septum with significant narrowing with what appeared to be detached perhaps from his ipsilateral cartilages rather from his previous surgery.  These were secured in place in the pockets using a 5-0 PDS suture in a mattress fashion in two places.  Following this, attention was turned to placing the alar rim grafts where pockets were created along the caudal aspect of the lower lateral cartilage and just along the alar margin.  Subsequently, the alar rim grafts were placed and extended all the way to the piriform aperture.  This was sutured in place using a 5-0 self-absorbing gut suture.  The lower lateral cartilage has had some inherent asymmetry.  This may have been related to his previous surgery with some asymmetry of the dome; however, this was left in place as he did not desire any changes in the tip region, and there was adequate support.  An endodermal suture was placed just to reenforce the region using a 5-0 PDS suture.  Following all this, the area was closed using a mattress 4-0 plain gut on a Keith needle followed by the application of ***** 5-0 fast-absorbing gut to close the hemitransfixion incision.  Very carefully, the skin and subcutaneous tissue envelopes were reflected.  The curvilinear incision was closed using a Vicryl followed by interrupted 6-0 Prolene sutures.  The marginal incisions were then closed using 5-0 fast-absorbing gut.  Doyle splints were placed and secured down using a nylon suture.  They had ointment also placed on them.  Following this, nasopharynx was suctioned.  There were no further abnormalities noted and everything appeared to be in nice position.  Therefore, an external splint was placed after the application of Steri-Strips.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  He was awakened in the operating room.  He was extubated and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.",2.0

He is scheduled for the above-mentioned procedures.  The planned procedures were discussed with the patient including the associated risks.  The risks included but are not limited to bleeding, infection, nerve damage, failure to heal, possible need for reoperation, possible recurrence, or any associated risk of the anesthesia.  He voiced understanding and agreed to proceed as planned.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was identified in the holding area and correct operative site was identified by the surgeon's mark.  Informed consent was obtained.  The patient was then brought to the operating room and transferred to the operating table in supine position.  Time-out was then performed at which point the surgeon, nursing staff, and anesthesia staff all confirmed the correct identification.,After adequate general LMA anesthesia was obtained, a well-padded tourniquet was placed on the patient's right upper arm.  The right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Planned skin incision was marked along the base of the patient's right palm.  Right upper extremity was then exsanguinated using Esmarch.  The tourniquet was then inflated to 250 mmHg.  Skin incision was then made and dissection was carried down with scalpel to the level of the palmar fascia which was sharply divided by the skin incision.  Bleeding points were identified with electrocautery using bipolar electrocautery.  Retractors were then placed to allow visualization of the distal extent of the transverse carpal ligament, and this was then divided longitudinally under direct vision.  Baby Metzenbaum scissors were used to dissect distal to this area to confirm the absence of any remaining crossing obstructing fibrous band.  Retractors were then replaced proximally to allow visualization of proximal extent of the transverse carpal ligament and the release was continued proximally until complete release was performed.  This was confirmed by visually and palpably.  Next, baby Metzenbaum scissors were used to dissect anteroposterior adjacent antebrachial fascia, and this was divided longitudinally under direct vision using baby Metzenbaum scissors to a level of approximately 3 cm proximal to the proximal extent of the skin incision.  Carpal canal was then inspected.  The median nerve was flattened and injected.  No other abnormalities were noted.  Wounds were then irrigated with normal saline and antibiotic additive.  Decadron 4 mg was then placed adjacent to the median nerve.  Skin incision was then closed with interrupted 5-0 nylon suture.  The wound was then dressed with Adaptic, 4 x 4s, Kling, and Coban.  The tourniquet was then deflated.  Attention was then directed to the left side.  Using sterile technique, the left carpal canal was injected with a mixture of 40 mg of Depo-Medrol, 1 cc of 1% lidocaine, and 1 cc of 0.25% Marcaine.  Band-Aid was then placed over the injection site.  The patient was then awakened, extubated, and transferred over to his hospital bed.  He was transported to recovery room in stable condition.  There were no intraoperative or immediate postoperative complications.  All counts were reported as correct.",2.0

Necrotic testes.,SURGERY:,  Left orchiectomy, scrotal exploration, right orchidopexy.,DRAINS:,  Penrose drain on the left hemiscrotum.,The patient was given vancomycin, Zosyn, and Levaquin preop.,BRIEF HISTORY:  ,The patient is a 49-year-old male who came into the emergency room with 2-week history of left testicular pain, scrotal swelling, elevated white count of 39,000.  The patient had significant scrotal swelling and pain.  Ultrasound revealed necrotic testicle.  Options such as watchful waiting and removal of the testicle were discussed.  Due to elevated white count, the patient was told that he must have the testicle removed due to the infection and possible early signs of urosepsis.  The risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, scrotal issues, other complications were discussed.  The patient was told about the morbidity and mortality of the procedure and wanted to proceed.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the OR.  Anesthesia was applied.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  A midline scrotal incision was made.  There was very, very thick scrotal skin.  There was no necrotic skin.  As soon as the left hemiscrotum was entered, significant amount of pus poured out of the left hemiscrotum.  The testicle was completely filled with pus and had completely disintegrated with pus.  The pus just poured out of the left testicle.  The left testicle was completely removed.  Debridement was done of the scrotal wall to remove any necrotic tissue.  Over 2 L of antibiotic irrigation solution was used to irrigate the left hemiscrotum.  There was good tissue left after all the irrigation and debridement.  A Penrose drain was placed in the bottom of the left hemiscrotum.  I worried about the patient may have torsed and then the testicle became necrotic, so the plan was to pex the right testicle, plus the right side also appeared very abnormal.  So, the right hemiscrotum was opened.  The testicle had significant amount of swelling and scrotal wall was very thick.  The testicle appeared normal.  There was no pus coming out of the right hemiscrotum.  At this time, a decision was made to place 4-0 Prolene nonabsorbable stitches in 3 different quadrants to prevent it from torsion.  The hemiscrotum was closed using 2-0 Vicryl in interrupted stitches and the skin was closed using 2-0 PDS in horizontal mattress.  There was very minimal pus left behind and the skin was very healthy.  Decision was made to close it to help the patient heal better in the long run.

Repair of periumbilical hernia.,ANESTHESIA: , General with endotracheal intubation.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,DISPOSITION: , The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery in stable condition.,SPECIMEN: , Hernia sac.,HISTORY:  ,The patient is a 98-year-old female who presents from nursing home extended care facility with an incarcerated umbilical hernia, intractable nausea and vomiting and a bowel obstruction.  Upon seeing the patient and discussing in extent with the family, it was decided the patient needed to go to the operating room for this nonreducible umbilical hernia and bowel obstruction and the family agreed with surgery.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , The patient was found to have an incarcerated umbilical hernia.  There was a loop of small bowel incarcerated within the hernia sac.  It showed signs of ecchymosis, however no signs of any ischemia or necrosis.  It was easily reduced once opening the abdomen and the rest of the small bowel was ran without any other defects or abnormalities.,PROCEDURE: , After informed written consent, risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient and the patient's family.  The patient was brought to the operating suite.  After general endotracheal intubation, prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion.  A midline incision was made around the umbilical hernia defect with a #10 blade scalpel.  Dissection was then carried down to the fascia.  Using a sharp dissection, an incision was made above the defect superior to the defect entering the fascia.  The abdomen was entered under direct visualization.  The small bowel that was entrapped within the hernia sac was easily reduced and observed and appeared to be ecchymotic, however, no signs of ischemia were noted or necrosis.  The remaining of the fascia was then extended using Metzenbaum scissors.  The hernia sac was removed using Mayo scissors and sent off as specimen.  Next, the bowel was run from the ligament of Treitz to the ileocecal valve with no evidence of any other abnormalities.  The small bowel was then milked down removing all the fluid.  The bowel was decompressed distal to the obstruction.  Once returning the abdominal contents to the abdomen, attention was next made in closing the abdomen and using #1 Vicryl suture in the figure-of-eight fashion the fascia was closed.  The umbilicus was then reapproximated to its anatomical position with a #1 Vicryl suture.  A #3-0 Vicryl suture was then used to reapproximate the deep dermal layers and skin staples were used on the skin.  Sterile dressings were applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery in stable condition.",2.0

Placement of vacuum-assisted closure device, less than 50 centimeter squared (CPT code 97605).,PREOP DIAGNOSIS: , Postoperative wound infection, complicated (ICD-9 code 998.59).,POSTOP DIAGNOSIS: , Postoperative wound infection, complicated (ICD-9 code 998.59).,PROCEDURE DETAIL:  ,The patient is a 59-year-old gentleman who is status post open reduction and internal fixation of bilateral calcanei.  He was admitted for a left wound breakdown with drainage.  He underwent an irrigation and debridement with VAC placement 72 hours prior to this operative visit.  It was decided to bring him back for a repeat irrigation and debridement and VAC change prior to Plastics doing a local flap.  The risks of surgery were discussed in detail including, but not limited to infection, bleeding, injuries to nerves and vital structures, need for reoperation, pain or stiffness, arthritis, fracture, the risk of anesthesia.  The patient understood these risks and wished to proceed.  The patient was admitted, and the operative site was marked.,The patient was brought to the operating room and given general anesthetic.  He was placed in the right lateral decubitus, and all bony prominences were well padded.  An axillary roll was placed.  A well-padded thigh tourniquet was placed on the left leg.  The patient then received antibiotics on the floor prior to coming down to the operating room which satisfied the preoperative requirement.  Left leg was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  The previous five antibiotic spacer beads were removed without difficulty.  The wound was then rongeured and curetted, and all bone was cleaned down to healthy bleeding bone.  The wound actually looked quite good with evidence of purulence or drainage.  Skin edges appeared to be viable.  Hardware all looked to be intact.  At this point, the wound was irrigated with 9 liters of bibiotic solution.  A VAC sponge was then placed over the wound, and the patient's leg was placed into a posterior splint.  The patient was awakened and then taken to recovery in good condition.,Dr. X was present for the timeouts and for all critical portions of the procedure.  He was immediately available for any questions during the case.,PLAN:,1.  A CAM walker boots.,2.  A VAC change on Sunday by the nurse.,3.  A flap per Plastic Surgery.",1.0
2977,"CLINICAL HISTORY:,  A 48-year-old smoker found to have a right upper lobe mass on chest x-ray and is being evaluated for chest pain.  PET scan demonstrated a mass in the right upper lobe and also a mass in the right lower lobe, which were also identified by CT scan.  The lower lobe mass was approximately 1 cm in diameter and the upper lobe mass was 4 cm to 5 cm in diameter.  The patient was referred for surgical treatment.,SPECIMEN:,A.  Lung, wedge biopsy right lower lobe,B.  Lung, resection right upper lobe,C.  Lymph node, biopsy level 2 and 4,D.  Lymph node, biopsy level 7 subcarinal,FINAL DIAGNOSIS:,A.  Wedge biopsy of right lower lobe showing:  Adenocarcinoma, Grade 2, Measuring 1 cm in diameter with invasion of the overlying pleura and with free resection margin.,B.  Right upper lobe lung resection showing:  Adenocarcinoma, grade 2, measuring 4 cm in diameter with invasion of the overlying pleura and with free bronchial margin.  Two (2) hilar lymph nodes with no metastatic tumor.,C.  Lymph node biopsy at level 2 and 4 showing seven (7) lymph nodes with anthracosis and no metastatic tumor.,D.  Lymph node biopsy, level 7 subcarinal showing (5) lymph nodes with anthracosis and no metastatic tumor.,COMMENT:  ,The morphology of the tumor seen in both lobes is similar and we feel that the smaller tumor involving the right lower lobe is most likely secondary to transbronchial spread from the main tumor involving the right upper lobe.  This suggestion is supported by the fact that no obvious vascular or lymphatic invasion is demonstrated and adjacent to the smaller tumor, there is isolated nests of tumor cells within the air spaces.  Furthermore, immunoperoxidase stain for Ck-7, CK-20 and TTF are performed on both the right lower and right upper lobe nodule.  The immunohistochemical results confirm the lung origin of both tumors and we feel that the tumor involving the right lower lobe is due to transbronchial spread from the larger tumor nodule involving the right upper lobe.,",1.0

Interpretation of Radiograph.,ANESTHESIA:  ,IV Sedation with Versed and Fentanyl.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  None.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,INDICATIONS: , Patient with reflex sympathetic dystrophy, left side.  Positive for allodynia, pain, mottled appearance, skin changes upper extremities as well as swelling.,SUMMARY OF PROCEDURE: , Patient is admitted to the Operating Room.  Monitors placed, including EKG, Pulse oximeter, and BP cuff.  Patient had a pillow placed under the shoulder blades.  The head and neck was allowed to fall back into hyperextension.  The neck region was prepped and draped in sterile fashion with Betadine and alcohol.  Four sterile towels were placed.  The cricothyroid membrane was palpated, then going one finger's breadth lateral from the cricothyroid membrane and one finger's breadth inferior, the carotid pulse was palpated and the sheath was retracted laterally.  A 22 gauge SMK 5-mm bare tipped needle was then introduced in between the cricothyroid membrane and the carotid sheath and directed inferiomedially.  The needle is advanced prudently through the tissues, avoiding the carotid artery laterally.  The tip of the needle is perceived to intersect with the vertebral body of Cervical #7 and this was visualized by fluoroscopy.  Aspiration was cautiously performed after the needle was retracted approximately 1 mm and held steady with left hand.  No venous or arterial blood return is noted.  No cerebral spinal fluid is noted.  Positive sensory stimulation was elicited using the Radionics unit at 50 Hz from 0-0.1 volts and negative motor stimulation was elicited from 1-10 volts at 2 Hz.  After negative aspiration through the 22 gauge SMK 5mm bare tipped needle is absolutely confirmed, 5 cc of solution (solution consisting of 5 cc of 0.5% Marcaine, 1 cc of triamcinolone) was then injected into the stellate ganglion region.  This was done with intermittent aspiration vigilantly verifying negative aspiration.  The stylet was then promptly replaced and neurolysis (nerve decompression) was then carried out for 60 seconds at 80 degrees centigrade.  This exact same procedure using the exact same protocol was repeated one more time to complete the two lesions of the stellate ganglion.  The patient was immediately placed in the sitting position to reduce any side effect from the stellate ganglion block associated with cephalad spread of the solution.  Pressure was placed over the puncture site for approximately five minutes to eliminate any hemorrhage from blood vessels that may have been punctured and a Band-Aid was placed over the puncture site.  Patient was monitored for an additional ten to fifteen minutes and was noted to have tolerated the procedure well without any adverse sequelae.  Significant temperature elevation was noted on the affected side verifying neurolysis of the ganglion.  ,Interpretation of radiograph reveals placement of the 22-gauge SMK 5-mm bare tipped needle in the region of the stellate ganglion on the affected side.  Four lesions were carried out.",1.0
3112,"PROCEDURE: , Fiberoptic bronchoscopy.,PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Right lung atelectasis.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Extensive mucus plugging in right main stem bronchus.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  Fiberoptic bronchoscopy was carried out at the bedside in the medical ICU after Versed 0.5 mg intravenously given in 2 aliquots.  The patient was breathing supplemental nasal and mask oxygen throughout the procedure.  Saturations and vital signs remained stable throughout.  A flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope was passed through the right naris.  The vocal cords were visualized.  Secretions in the larynx were as aspirated.  As before, he had a mucocele at the right anterior commissure that did not obstruct the glottic opening.  The ports were anesthetized and the trachea entered.  There was no cough reflex helping explain the propensity to aspiration and mucus plugging.  Tracheal secretions were aspirated.  The main carinae were sharp.  However, there were thick, sticky, grey secretions filling the right mainstem bronchus up to the level of the carina.  This was gradually lavaged clear.  Saline and Mucomyst solution were used to help dislodge remaining plugs.  The airways appeared slightly friable, but were patent after the airways were suctioned.  O2 saturations remained in the mid-to-high 90s.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Specimens were submitted for microbiologic examination.  Despite his frail status, he tolerated bronchoscopy quite well.",2.0
444,"TITLE OF PROCEDURE: , Percutaneous liver biopsy.,ANALGESIA: , 2% Lidocaine.,ALLERGIES: , The patient denied any allergy to iodine, lidocaine or codeine.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The procedure was described in detail to the patient at a previous clinic visit and by the medical staff today.  The patient was told of complications which might occur consisting of bleeding, bile peritonitis, bowel perforation, pneumothorax, or death.  The risks and benefits of the procedure were understood, and the patient signed the consent form freely.,With the patient lying in the supine position and the right hand underneath the head, an area of maximal dullness was identified in the mid-axillary location by percussion.  The area was prepped and cleaned with povidone iodine following which the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and serosal surfaces were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine down to the capsule of the liver.  Next, a small incision was made with a Bard-Parker #11 scalpel.  A 16-gauge modified Klatskin needle was inserted through the incision and into the liver on one occasion with the patient in deep expiration.  Liver cores measuring *** cm were obtained and will be sent to Pathology for routine histologic study.,POST-PROCEDURE COURSE AND DISPOSITION: , The patient will remain under close observation in the medical treatment room for four to six hours and then be discharged home without medication.  Normal activities can be resumed tomorrow.  The patient is to contact me if severe abdominal or chest pain, fever, melena, light-headedness or any unusual symptoms develop.

He has been evaluated now for inflammatory bowel disease.  Upon endoscopy, the colon prep was good.  We were able to reach the cecum without difficulty.  There are no diverticluli, inflammatory bowel disease, strictures, or obstructing lesions.  There was a pedunculated polyp approximately 4.5 cm in size located in the sigmoid colon at approximately 35 cm.  This large polyp was removed using the snare technique.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the endoscopy suite, prepped and draped in left lateral decubitus position.  IV sedation was given by Anesthesia Department.  The Olympus videoscope was inserted into anus.  Using air insufflation, the colonoscope was advanced through the anus to the rectum, sigmoid colon, descending colon, transverse colon, ascending colon and cecum, the above gross findings were noted.  The colonoscope was slowly withdrawn and carefully examined the lumen of the bowel.  When the polyp again was visualized, the snare was passed around the polyp.  It required at least two to three passes of the snare to remove the polyp in its totality.  There was a large stalk on the polyp.  ________ the polyp had been removed down to the junction of the polyp in the stalk, which appeared to be cauterized and no residual adenomatous tissue was present.  No bleeding was identified.  The colonoscope was then removed and patient was sent to recovery room in stable condition.",2.0
3325,"HISTORY:,  The patient is a 10-1/2-year-old born with asplenia syndrome with a complex cyanotic congenital heart disease characterized by dextrocardia bilateral superior vena cava, complete atrioventricular septal defect, a total anomalous pulmonary venous return to the right-sided atrium, and double-outlet to the right ventricle with malposed great vessels, the aorta being anterior with a severe pulmonary stenosis.  He had undergone staged repair beginning on 04/21/1997 with a right modified Blalock-Taussig shunt followed on 09/02/1999 with a bilateral bidirectional Glenn shunt, and left pulmonary artery to main pulmonary artery pericardial patch augmentation.  These procedures were performed at Medical College Hospital.  Family states that they moved to the United States.  Evaluation at the Children's Hospital earlier this year demonstrated complete occlusion of the right bidirectional Glenn shunt as well as occlusion of the proximal right pulmonary artery.  He was also found to have elevated Glenn pressures at 22 mmHg, transpulmonary gradient axis of 14 mmHg.  The QP:QS ratio of 0.6:1.  A large decompressing venous collateral was also appreciated.  The patient was brought back to cardiac catheterization in an attempt to reconstitute the right caval pulmonary anastomosis and to occlude the venous collateral vessel.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , After sedation and local Xylocaine anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped.  Cardiac catheterization was performed as outlined in the attached continuation sheets.  Vascular entry was by percutaneous technique, and the patient was heparinized.  Monitoring during the procedure included continuous surface ECG, continuous pulse oximetry, and cycled cuff blood pressures, in addition to intravascular pressures.,Using a 6-French sheath, a 6-French wedge catheter was inserted in the right femoral vein and advanced from the inferior vena cava into the right-sided atrium pulmonary veins and the right ventricle.,Using a 6-French sheath, a 5-French pigtail catheter was inserted into the right femoral artery and advanced retrograde to the descending aorta and ascending aorta.  A separate port of arterial access was obtained in the left femoral artery utilizing a 5-French sheath.,Percutaneous access into the right jugular vein was attempted, but unsuccessful.  Ultrasound on the right neck demonstrated a complete thrombosis of the right internal jugular vein.  Using percutaneous technique and a 5-French sheath, 5-French wedge catheter was inserted into the left internal jugular vein and advanced along the left superior vena cava across the left caval-pulmonary anastomosis into the main pulmonary artery and left pulmonary artery with aid of guidewire.  This catheter then also advanced into the bridging innominate vein.  The catheter was then exchanged over wire for a 4-French Bernstein catheter, which was advanced to the blind end of the right superior vena cava.  A balloon wedge angiogram of the right lower pulmonary vein demonstrated back filling of a small right lower pulmonary artery.  There was no vascular continuity to the stump of the right Glenn.  The jugular venous catheter and sheaths were exchanged over a wire for a 6-French flexor sheath, which was advanced to the proximal right superior vena cava.  The Bernstein catheter was then reintroduced using a Terumo guidewire.  Probing of the superior vena cava facilitated access into the right lower pulmonary artery.  The angiogram in the right pulmonary artery showed a diminutive right lower pulmonary artery and severe long segment proximal stenosis.  The distal pulmonary measured approximately 5.5 to 60 mm in diameter with a long segment stenosis measuring approximately 31 mm in length.  The length of the obstruction was balloon dilated using ultra-thin SD 4 x 2 cm balloon catheter with complete disappearance of the waist.  This facilitated advancement of a flexor sheath into the proximal portion of the stenosis.  A PG 2960 BPX Genesis stent premounted on a 6 mm OptiProbe.  A balloon catheter was advanced across the area of narrowing and inflated with a near-complete disappearance of proximal waist.  Angiogram demonstrated a good stent apposition to the caval wall.  Further angioplasty was then performed utilizing an ultra-thin SDS 8 x 3 cm balloon catheter inflated to 19 atmospheres pressure with complete disappearance of a distinct proximal waist.  Angiogram demonstrated wide patency of reconstituted right caval pulmonary anastomosis though there was no flow seen to the right upper pulmonary artery.  The balloon wedge angiograms were then obtained in the right upper pulmonary veins suggesting the presence of right upper pulmonary artery and not contiguous with the right lower pulmonary artery.  Bernstein catheter was advanced into the main pulmonary artery where a wire probing of the stump of the proximal right pulmonary artery facilitated access to the right upper pulmonary artery.  Angiogram demonstrated severe long segment stenosis of the proximal right pulmonary artery.  Angioplasty of the right pulmonary was then performed using the OptiProbe 6-mm balloon catheter inflated to 16 atmospheres pressure with disappearance of a distinct waist.  Repeat angiogram showed improvement in caliber of right upper pulmonary artery with filling defect of the proximal right pulmonary artery.  The proximal right pulmonary artery was then dilated and stent implanted using a PG 2980 BPX Genesis stent premounted on 8-mm OptiProbe balloon catheter and implanted with complete disappearance of the waist.  Distal right upper pulmonary artery was then dilated and stent implanted utilizing a PG 1870 BPX Genesis stent premounted on 7-mm OptiProbe balloon catheter.  Repeat angiograms were then performed.  Attention was then directed to the large venous collateral vessel arising from the left superior vena cava with a contrast filling of a left-sided azygos vein.  A selective angiogram demonstrated a large azygos vein of the midsection measuring approximately 9.4 mm in diameter.  An Amplatzer 12 mm vascular plug was loaded on the delivery catheter and advanced through the flexor sheath into the azygos vein.  Once stable device was confirmed, the device was released from the delivery catheter.  The 4-French Bernstein catheter was then reintroduced and 5 inch empirical 0.038 inch, 10 cm x 8 mm detachable coils were then implanted above the vascular plug filling the proximal azygos vein.  A pigtail catheter was then introduced into the left superior vena cava for final angiogram.,Flows were calculated by the Fick technique using an assumed oxygen consumption and contents derived from Radiometer Hemoximeter saturations and hemoglobin capacity.,Cineangiograms were obtained with injection of the coronary sinus of pulmonary veins, the innominate vein, superior vena cava, the main pulmonary artery, and azygos vein.,After angiography, two normal-appearing renal collecting systems were visualized.  The catheters and sheaths were removed and topical pressure applied for hemostasis.  The patient was returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  There were no complications.,DISCUSSION:,  Oxygen consumption was assumed to be normal mixed venous saturation, but was low due to systemic arterial desaturation of 79%.  The pulmonary veins were fully saturated with partial pressure of oxygen ranging between 120 and 169 mmHg in 30% oxygen.  Remaining saturations reflected complete admixture.  There was increased saturation in the left pulmonary artery due to aortopulmonary collateral flow.  Phasic right atrial pressures were normal with an A-wave somewhat to the normal right ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 9 mmHg.  Left ventricular systolic pressure was systemic with no outflow obstruction to the ascending aorta.  Phasic ascending, descending pressures were similar and normal.  Mean Glenn pressures at initiation of the case were slightly elevated at 14 mmHg with a transpulmonary gradient of 9 mmHg.  The calculated systemic flow was a normal pulmonary flows reduced with a QP:QS ratio of 0.6:1.  The pulmonary vascular resistance was elevated at 4.4 Woods units.  Following stent implantation in the right caval pulmonary anastomosis and right pulmonary artery, there was a slight increase in the Glenn venous pressures to 16 mmHg.  Following embolization of the azygos vein, there was increase in systemic arterial saturation to 84% and increase in mixed venous saturation.  There was similar increase in Glenn pressures to 28 mmHg with a transpulmonary gradient of 14 mmHg.  There was an increase in arterial pressure.  The calculated systemic flow increased from 3.1 liters /minute/meter squared to 4.3 liters/minute/meter squared.  Angiogram within the innominate vein following stent implantation demonstrated appropriate stent position without significant distortion of the innominate vein or proximal cava.  There appeared unobstructed contrast flow to the right lower pulmonary artery of a 1-mmHg mean pressure gradient.  There was absence of contrast filling of the right middle and right upper pulmonary artery.  Final angiogram with a contrast injection in the left superior vena cava showed a forward flow through the right Glenn, a good contrast filling of the right lower pulmonary artery, and a widely patent left Glenn negative contrast washout of the proximal right pulmonary artery and left pulmonary artery presumably due to aortopulmonary collateral flow.  Contrast injection within the right upper pulmonary artery following the stent implantation demonstrated widely patent proximal right pulmonary artery along the length of the implanted stents though with retrograde contrast flow.,INITIAL DIAGNOSES:  ,1.

One 10-mm 2.0 partially threaded cannulated screw of the OsteoMed system.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position.  After adequate sedation was achieved by the anesthesia team, the above-mentioned anesthetic mixture was infiltrated directly into the patient's right foot to anesthetize the future surgical sites.  The right ankle was covered with cast padding and an 18-inch ankle tourniquet was placed around the right ankle and set up at 250 mmHg.  The right foot was then prepped, scrubbed, and draped in a normal sterile technique.  The right ankle tourniquet was then inflated.  Attention was then directed on the dorsomedial aspect of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint where a 6-cm linear incision was placed parallel and medial to the course of the extensor hallucis longus tendon to the right great toe.  The incision was deepened through subcutaneous tissues.  All the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped, and cauterized.  The incision was deepened to the level of the capsule and the periosteum of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint.  All the tendinous and neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved.  Using sharp and dull dissection, the periosteal and capsular tissues were mobilized from the head and neck of the first right metatarsal and the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe.  The conjoint tendon was identified on the lateral plantar aspect of the base of the proximal phalanx and resected transversely.,A lateral capsulotomy was also performed at the level of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint.  Using sharp and dull dissection, the dorsomedial prominence of the first right metatarsal head was adequately exposed and resected with the use of a sagittal saw.  The same saw was used to perform the Austin osteotomy on the capital aspect of the first right metatarsal with its apex distal and its base proximal.  The dorsal arm of the osteotomy was longer than the plantar arm and noted to accommodate for the future internal fixation.  The capital fragment of the first right metatarsal was then transposed laterally and impacted on the shaft of the first right metatarsal.  Two wires of the OsteoMed system were also used as provisional fixation wires and also as guidewires for the insertion of the future screws.  The wires were inserted dorsal distal to plantar proximal through the dorsal arm of the osteotomy.  The two screws from the 3.0 OsteoMed system were inserted over the wires using AO technique.  One screw measured 16 mm, second screw measured 18 mm in length.  Both 3.0 screws were then evaluated for the fixation of the osteotomy after the wires were removed.  Fixation of the osteotomy was found to be excellent.  The dorsomedial prominence of the first right metatarsal shaft was then resected with the sagittal saw.  To improve the correction of the hallux abductus angle, an Akin osteotomy was also performed on the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe with its base medially and its apex laterally.  Upon removal of the base wedge from the base of the proximal phalanx, the osteotomy was reduced with the OsteoMed smooth wire, which was also used as a guidewire for the insertion of a 16-mm partially threaded cannulated screw from the OsteoMed 3.0 system.  Upon insertion of the screw, using AO technique, the wire was removed.  The screw was inserted proximal medial to distal lateral through the osteotomy of the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe.  Fixation of the osteotomy was found to be excellent.  Reduction of the bunion deformity was also found to be excellent and position of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint was found to be anatomical.  Range of motion of that joint was uninhibited.  The area was flushed copiously with saline.  Then, 3-0 suture material was used to approximate the periosteum and capsular tissues, 4-0 was used to approximate the subcutaneous tissues, and Steri-Strips were used to reinforce the incision.  Attention was directed over the neck of the second right metatarsal head where a 3-cm linear incision was placed directly over the surgical neck of the second right metatarsal.  The incision was deepened through subcutaneous tissues.  All the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped and cauterized.  The incision was deepened through the level of the periosteum over the surgical neck of the second right metatarsal.  All the tendinous and neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved.  Using sharp and dull dissection, the surgical neck of the second right metatarsal was adequately exposed and then Weil-type osteotomy was performed from dorsal distal to plantar proximal through the surgical neck of the second right metatarsal.  The capital fragment was then transposed proximally and impacted on the shaft of the second right metatarsal.,The 2.0 Osteo-Med system was also used to fixate this osteotomy wire from that system was inserted dorsal proximal to plantar distal through the second right metatarsal osteotomy and the wire was used as a guidewire for the insertion of the 10-mm partially threaded 2.0 cannulated screw.  Upon insertion of the screw, using AO technique, the wire was then removed.  Fixation of the osteotomy with 2.0 screw was found to be excellent.  The second right metatarsophalangeal joint was then relocated and the dislocation of that joint was completely reduced.  Range of motion of the second right metatarsophalangeal joint was found to be excellent.  Then, 3-0 Vicryl suture material was used to approximate the periosteal tissues.  Then, 4-0 Vicryl was used to approximate the skin incision.  Attention was then directed at the level of the PIP joint of the second right toe where two semi-elliptical incisions were placed directly over the bony prominence at the level of the second right PIP joint.  The island of skin between the two semi-elliptical incisions was resected in toto.  The dissection was carried down to the level of extensor digitorum longus of the second right toe, which was resected transversely at the level of the PIP joint.  A capsulotomy and a medial and lateral collateral ligament release of the PIP joint of the second right toe was also performed and head of the proximal phalanx of the second right digit was adequately exposed.  Using the double-action bone cutter, the head of the proximal phalanx of the second right toe was then resected.  The area was copiously flushed with saline.  The capsular and periosteal tissues were approximated with 2-0 Vicryl and 3-0 Vicryl suture material was also used to approximate the extensor digitorum longus to the second right toe.  A 5-0 Prolene was used to approximate the skin edges of the two semi-elliptical incisions.  Correction of the hammertoe deformity and relocation of the second right metatarsophalangeal joint were evaluated with the foot loaded and were found to be excellent and anatomical.  At this time, the patient's three incisions were covered with Xeroform, copious amounts of fluff and Kling, stockinette, and Ace bandage.  The patient's right ankle tourniquet was deflated, time was 60 minutes.  Immediate hyperemia was noted on the entire right lower extremity upon deflation of the cuffs.,The patient's right foot was placed in a surgical shoe and the patient was transferred to the recovery room under the care of anesthesia team with the vital signs stable and the vascular status at appropriate levels.  The patient was given instructions and education on how to continue caring for her right foot surgery.  The patient was eventually discharged from Hospital according to nursing protocol and was advised to follow up with Dr. X's office in one week's time for her first postoperative appointment.",2.0

The posterior left chest wall was prepped and draped in the usual fashion and then a mixture of 1% Xylocaine 20 mL and Marcaine 0.25% 20 mL were mixed together and the intercostal spaces from the fourth to the tenth ribs were anesthetized.  A total of 30 mL worth of solution was used.  I also injected some local anesthetic subcutaneously into an area of contusion in the left lumbar area.,The patient tolerated the procedure well.  She had no respiratory distress.  Immediately, the patient felt some relief from the pain.  Chest x-ray was ordered for the following day.",1.0
2436,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Left canal cholesteatoma.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Left canal cholesteatoma.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:,1.  Left canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy with ossicular chain reconstruction.,2.  Microdissection.,3.  NIM facial nerve monitoring for three hours.,COMPLICATIONS:  ,None.,FINDINGS:,  There is an extremely large canal cholesteatoma, which eroded most of the posterior and superior canal wall.  There was a significant amount of myringosclerosis and tympanosclerosis.  There is some mild erosion of the lenticular process of the incus.  The facial nerve was normal.  We removed the incus, removed the head of the malleus, and placed a titanium-PORP from the stapes capitulum to a cartilage graft.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room, placed under general anesthetic and intubated without difficulty.  The NIM facial nerve monitoring electrodes were positioned and monitoring was performed throughout the procedure.  There was no abnormal activity during this case.  We inspected the ear canal, identified the huge defect, which was completely filled with cerumen.  Through the ear canal, we removed as much as we could and then infiltrated the canal and postauricular area with 1:100,000 of epinephrine.,We prepped and draped the ear in a sterile fashion.  We reopened the previously used postauricular incision and dissected down the mastoid cortex.  We reflected the soft tissues anteriorly to the level of the ear canal and identified where the ear canal skin entered the defect in the mastoid bone.  A #6 cutting bur was used to drill down the mastoid cortex and identified this cholesteatoma which was then carefully dissected out.  We went all the way to the mastoid antrum.  We finished a complete mastoidectomy with identification of the tegmen, sigmoid sinus.  We removed the lateral aspect of the mastoid tip.  We lowered the facial ridge.  The incudostapedial joint was already membranous in nature, we went ahead and used the joint knife and removed the incus.  We separated the incus from the stapes and then removed it.  We used a malleus head nipper to remove the head of the malleus and then we continued to saucerize the entire mastoid cavity.,There was no cholesteatoma within the middle ear space, but there was roughly 40% surface area perforation.  The remaining portion of the tympanic membrane was extremely calcified and myringosclerotic; this was removed.  There was also a large focus of tympanosclerosis between the stapes crura, which was impinging the ability of the stapes to move.  We carefully dissected this out.  This did seem to improve the mobility of the stapes somewhat.  At this point, there was a near total perforation.  There was only a minimal amount of anterior remnant of the drum left.  We tried to go ahead and harvest the temporalis fascia, but there was really only wisps of this fascia in place.  He had already had a previous tympanoplasty, but even outside the areas where the graft was taken, the temporalis muscle was quite atrophied and lumpy, and I suspect this was due to his chronic disease and long history of corticosteroid usage.  We harvested a few pieces as best as we could.  We went ahead and did a meatoplasty by making a canal incision in the 6 o'clock and 12 o'clock positions.  We excised cartilage posteriorly and inferiorly to enlarge the meatus.  This cartilage was thin and used for cartilage tympanoplasty.  We placed some Gelfoam in the middle ear space and placed the cartilage on the top of it.  We did cut a titanium-PORP of the proper side and placed on top of the stapes capitulum to interface with the cartilage cap.  A few other small pieces of temporalis fascia were used to bulge through the surrounding edges of the cartilage and make sure that it was medial to any remnant of ear canal and tympanic membrane remnants.  We placed a layer of Gelfoam lateral to the graft, closed the postauricular incision in layers and put 2 Merocel packs in the ear.  Glasscock dressing was applied.  The patient was awakened from anesthesia and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.  He will be given antibiotics and pain medicines and he will be given instructions to follow up with me in one week.",2.0

The sheath was washed with sterile saline.  Following this, the left coronary was attempted to be cannulated with an XP catheter, however, the catheter folded on itself and could not reach the left main, this was removed.  A second 6-French JL4 guiding catheter was then used to cannulate the left main and initial guiding shots demonstrated occlusion of the proximal LAD.  The patient had an ACT check, received additional IV heparin and IV ReoPro.  The lesion was crossed with 0.014 BMW wire and redilated with a 2.5 x 20-mm balloon at nominal pressures.  The balloon was deflated and angiography demonstrated establishment of flow.  Following this, the lesion was stented with a 2.5 x 18-mm Endeavor stent at 10 atmospheres.

1344,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Left hip degenerative arthritis.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Left hip degenerative arthritis.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  ,Total hip arthroplasty on the left.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General.,BLOOD LOSS: , 800 cc.,The patient was positioned with the left hip exposed on the beanbag.,IMPLANT SPECIFICATION: , A 54 mm Trilogy cup with cluster holes 3 x 50 mm diameter with a appropriate liner, a 28 mm cobalt-chrome head with a zero neck length head, and a 12 mm porous proximal collared femoral component.,GROSS INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS:  ,Severe degenerative changes within the femoral head as well as the acetabulum, anterior as well as posterior osteophytes.  The patient also had a rent in the attachment of the hip abductors and a partial rent in the vastus lateralis.  This was revealed once we removed the trochanteric bursa.,HISTORY:  ,This is a 56-year-old obese female with a history of bilateral degenerative hip arthritis.  She underwent a right total hip arthroplasty by Dr. X in the year of 2000, and over the past three years, the symptoms in her left hip had increased tremendously especially in the past few months.,Because of the increased amount of pain as well as severe effect on her activities of daily living and uncontrollable pain with narcotic medication, the patient has elected to undergo the above-named procedure.  All risks as well complications were discussed with the patient including but not limited to infection, scar, dislocation, need for further surgery, risk of anesthesia, deep vein thrombosis, and implant failure.  The patient understood all these risks and was willing to continue further on with the procedure.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was wheeled back to the Operating Room #2 at ABCD General Hospital on 08/27/03.  The general anesthetic was first performed by the Department of Anesthesia.  The patient was then positioned with the left hip exposed on the beanbag in the lateral position.  Kidney rests were also used because of the patient's size.  An axillary roll was also inserted for comfort in addition to a Foley catheter, which was inserted by the OR nurse.  All her bony prominences were well padded.  At this time, the left hip and left lower extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for this procedure.  At this time, an anterolateral approach was then performed, first incising through the skin in approximately 5 to 6 inches of subcutaneous fat.  The tensor fascia lata was then identified.  A self-retainer was then inserted to expose the operative field.  Bovie cautery was used for hemostasis.  At this time, a fresh blade was then used to incise the tensor fascia lata over the posterior one-third of the greater trochanter.  At this time, a blunt dissection was taken proximally.  The tensor fascia lata was occluded with a hip retractor.  At this time, after hemostasis was obtained, Bovie cautery was used to incise the proximal end of the vastus lateralis and removing the partial portion of the hip abductor, the gluteus medius.  At this time, a periosteal elevator was used to expose anterior hip capsule.  A ________ was then inserted over the femoral head purchasing of the acetabulum underneath the reflected head of the quadriceps muscle.  Once this was performed, Homan retractors were then inserted superiorly and inferiorly underneath the femoral neck.  At this time, a capsulotomy was then performed using a Bovie cautery and the capsulotomy was ________ and then edged over the acetabulum.  At this point, a large bone hook was then inserted over the neck and with gentle traction and external rotation, the femoral head was dislocated out of the acetabulum.  At this time, we had an exposure of the femoral head, which did reveal degenerative changes of the femoral head and once the acetabulum was visualized, we did see degenerative changes within the acetabulum as well as osteophyte formation around the rim of the acetabulum.  At this time, a femoral stem guide was then used to measure proximal femoral neck cut.  We made a cut approximately a fingerbreadth above the lesser trochanter.  At this time, with protection of the soft tissues an oscillating saw was used to make femoral neck cut.,The femoral head was then removed.  At this time, we removed the leg out of the bag and Homan retractors were then used to expose the acetabulum.  A long-handle knife was used to cut through the remainder of the capsule and remove the glenoid labrum around the rim of the acetabulum.  With better exposure of the acetabulum, we started reaming the acetabulum.  We started with a size #44 and progressively reamed to a size #50.  At the size #50 mm reamer, we obtained excellent bony bleeding with good remainder of bone stalk both anteriorly and posteriorly as well as superiorly within the acetabulum.  We then reamed up to size #52 in order to get bony bleeding around the rim as well as anterior and posterior within the acetabulum.  A size 54 mm Trilogy cup was then implanted with excellent approaches approximately 45 degrees of abduction and 10 to 15 degrees of anteversion dialed in.  Once the cup was impacted in place, we did visualize that the cup was well seated on to the internal portion of the acetabulum.  At this time, two screws were the placed within the superior table for better approaches securing the acetabular cup.  At this time, a plastic liner was then inserted for protection.  The leg was then placed back in the bag.  A Bennett retractor was used to retract the tensor fascia lata and femoral elevator was used to elevate the femur for better exposure and at this time, we began working on the femur.  A rongeur was used to lateralize over the greater trochanter.  A Box osteotome was used to remove the cancellous portion of the femoral neck.  A Charnley awl was then used to cannulate through the proximal femoral canal.  A power reamer was then used to ream the lateral aspect of the greater trochanter in order to provide maximal lateralization and prevent varus implantation of our stem.  At this time, we began broaching.  We started with a size #10 and progressively worked up to a size #12 mm broach.  Once the 12 mm broach was inserted in place, it was seated approximately 1 mm below the calcar.  A calcar reamer was then placed and the calcar was reamed smoothly.  A standard neck as well as a 28 mm plastic head was then placed and a trial reduction was then performed.  Once this was performed, the hip was taken to range of motion with external rotation, longitudinal traction as well as flexion and revealed good stability with no impingement or dislocation.  At this time, we removed 12 mm broach and proceeded with implanting our polyethylene liner within the acetabulum.  This was impacted and placed and checked to assure that it was well seated with no loosening.  Once this was performed, we then exposed the proximal femur one more time.  We copiously irrigated within the canal and then suctioned it dry.  At this time, a 12 mm porous proximal collared stem, a femoral component was then impacted in place.  Once it was well seated on the calcar, we double checked to assure that there was no evidence of calcar fractures, which there were none.  The 28 mm zero neck length cobalt-chrome femoral head was then impacted in place and the Morse taper assured that this was well fixed by ________.,Next, the hip was then reduced within the acetabulum and again we checked range of motion as well as ligamentous stability with gentle traction, external rotation, as well as hip flexion.  We were satisfied with components as well as the alignment of the components.  Copious irrigation was then used to irrigate the wound.  #1 Ethibond was then used to approximate the anterior hip capsule.  #1 Ethibond in interrupted fashion was used to approximate the vastus lateralis as well as the gluteus medius attachment over the partial gluteus medius attachment which was resected off the greater trochanter.  Next, a #1 Ethibond was then used to approximate the tensor fascia lata with figure-of-eight closure.  A tight closure was performed.  Since the patient did have a lot of subcutaneous fat, multiple #2-0 Vicryl sutures were then used to approximate the bed space and then #2-0 Vicryl for the subcutaneous skin.  Staples were then used for skin closure.  The patient's hip was then cleansed.  Sterile dressings consisting of Adaptic, 4 x 4, ABDs, and foam tape were then placed.  A drain was placed prior to wound closure for postoperative drainage.  After the dressing was applied, the patient was extubated safely and transferred to recovery in stable condition.  Prognosis is good.",2.0

Intraoperative cholangiogram.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was taken to the operative suite and placed in the supine position under general endotracheal anesthetic.  The patient received 1 gm of IV Ancef intravenously piggyback.  The abdomen was prepared and draped in routine sterile fashion.,A 1-cm incision was made at the umbilicus and a Veress needle was inserted.  Saline test was performed.  Satisfactory pneumoperitoneum was achieved by insufflation of CO2 to a pressure of 14 mmHg.  The Veress needle was removed.  A 10- to 11-mm cannula was inserted.  Inspection of the peritoneal cavity revealed a gallbladder that was soft and without adhesions to it.  It was largely mobile.  The liver had a normal appearance as did the peritoneal cavity.  A 5-mm cannula was inserted in the right upper quadrant anterior axillary line.  A second 5-mm cannula was inserted in the subcostal space.  A 10- to 11-mm cannula was inserted into the upper midline.,The gallbladder was reflected in a cephalad direction.  The gallbladder was punctured with the aspirating needle, and under C-arm fluoroscopy was filled with contrast, filling the intra- and extrahepatic biliary trees, which appeared normal.  Extra contrast was aspirated and the aspirating needle was removed.  The ampulla was grasped with a second grasper, opening the triangle of Calot.  The cystic duct was dissected and exposed at its junction with the ampulla, was controlled with a hemoclip, digitally controlled with two clips and divided.  This was done while the common duct was in full visualization.  The cystic artery was similarly controlled and divided.  The gallbladder was dissected from its bed and separated from the liver, brought to the outside through the upper midline cannula and removed.,The subhepatic and subphrenic spaces were irrigated thoroughly with saline solution.  There was oozing and bleeding from the lateral 5-mm cannula site, but this stopped spontaneously with removal of the cannula.  The subphrenic and subhepatic spaces were again irrigated thoroughly with saline until clear.  Hemostasis was excellent.  CO2 was evacuated and the camera removed.  The umbilical fascia was closed with 2-0 Vicryl, the subcu with 3-0 Vicryl, and the skin was closed with 4-0 nylon.  Sterile dressings were applied.  Sponge and needle counts were correct.",2.0

This is considered as a life threatening admission with a hemorrhage in the temporal lobe extending into the frontal lobe and with significant mass effect.,The patient apparently became hemiplegic suddenly today.  She also had an episode of incoherence and loss of consciousness as well as loss of bowel/urine.,She was brought to Emergency Room where a CT of the brain showed that she had significant hemorrhage of the right temporal lobe extending into the external capsule and across into the frontal lobe.  There is significant mass effect.  There is mixed density in the parenchyma of the temporal lobe.,She was originally scheduled for elective craniotomy for biopsy of the temporal lobe to find out why she was having spontaneous hemorrhages.  However, this event triggered her family to bring her to the emergency room, and this is considered a life threatening admission now with a significant mass effect, and thus we will proceed directly today for evacuation of ICH as well as biopsy of the temporal lobe as well as the dura.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was anesthetized by the anesthesiology team.  Appropriate central line as well as arterial line, Foley catheter, TED, and SCDs were placed.  The patient was positioned supine with a three-point Mayfield head pin holder.  Her scalp was prepped and draped in a sterile manner.  Her former incisional scar was barely and faintly noticed; however, through the same scalp scar, the same incision was made and extended slightly inferiorly.  The scalp was resected anteriorly.  The subdural scar was noted, and hemostasis was achieved using Bovie cautery.  The temporalis muscle was reflected along with the scalp in a subperiosteal manner, and the titanium plating system was then exposed.,The titanium plating system was then removed in its entirety.  The bone appeared to be quite fused in multiple points, and there were significant granulation tissue through the burr hole covers.,The granulation tissue was quite hemorrhagic, and hemostasis was achieved using bipolar cautery as well as Bovie cautery.,The bone flap was then removed using Leksell rongeur, and the underlying dura was inspected.  It was quite full.  The 4-0 sutures from the previous durotomy closure was inspected, and more of the inferior temporal bone was resected using high-speed drill in combination with Leksell rongeur.  The sphenoid wing was also resected using a high-speed drill as well as angled rongeur.,Hemostasis was achieved on the fresh bony edges using bone wax.  The dura pack-up stitches were noted around the periphery from the previous craniotomy.  This was left in place.,The microscope was then brought in to use for the remainder of the procedure until closure.  Using a #15 blade, a new durotomy was then made.  Then, the durotomy was carried out using Metzenbaum scissors, then reflected the dura anteriorly in a horseshoe manner, placed anteriorly, and this was done under the operating microscope.  The underlying brain was quite edematous.,Along the temporal lobe there was a stain of xanthochromia along the surface.  Thus a corticectomy was then accomplished using bipolar cautery, and the temporal lobe at this level and the middle temporal gyrus was entered.  The parenchyma of the brain did not appear normal.  It was quite vascular.  Furthermore, there was a hematoma mixed in with the brain itself.  Thus a core biopsy was then performed in the temporal tip.  The overlying dura was inspected and it was quite thickened, approximately 0.25 cm thick, and it was also highly vascular, and thus a big section of the dura was also trimmed using bipolar cautery followed by scissors, and several pieces of this vascularized dura was resected for pathology.  Furthermore, sample of the temporal lobe was cultured.,Hemostasis after evacuation of the intracerebral hematoma using controlled suction as well as significant biopsy of the overlying dura as well as intraparenchymal lesion was accomplished.  No attempt was made to enter into the sylvian fissure.  Once hemostasis was meticulously achieved, the brain was inspected.  It still was quite swollen, known that there was still hematoma in the parenchyma of the brain.  However, at this time it was felt that since there is no diagnosis made intraoperatively, we would need to stage this surgery further should it be needed once the diagnosis is confirmed.  DuraGen was then used for duraplasty because of the resected dura.  The bone flap was then repositioned using Lorenz plating system.  Then a medium Hemovac drain was placed in subdural space.  Temporalis muscle was approximated using 2-0 Vicryl.  The galea was then reapproximated using inverted 2-0 Vicryl.  The scalp was then reapproximated using staples.  The head was then dressed and wrapped in a sterile fashion.,She was witnessed to be extubated in the operating room postoperatively, and she followed commands briskly.

The previous incision was opened by excising the old scar.  The port pocket was then opened and the port was removed from the pocket.  There was a resistance to the catheter being removed and so therefore, we began following the catheter along its path opening the tract until finally the catheter seemed to come free and could be pulled out without difficulty.  The port pocket was then closed using a #3-0 Vicryl in subcutaneous tissue, #5-0 subcuticular Monocryl in the skin.  Sterile dressing was applied.
