case  the patient wa monitored for cardiac blood pressure and oxygen saturation continuouslythe hair wa prepared and secured with rubber band and micropore tape along the incision line  a marking pen had been used to outline the area of the incision which included the preauricular area to the level of the tragus the posttragal region the post auricular region and into the hairline  in addition the incision wa marked in the temporal area in the event of a temporal lift then across the coronal scalp for the forehead lift  the incision wa marked in the submental crease for the submental lipectomy and liposuction  the incision in the post auricular area extended up on the posterior aspect of the ear and ended near the occipital hairlinethe area to be operated on were injected with 1 lidocaine containing 1100000 epinephrine  this provided local anesthesia and vasoconstriction  the total of lidocaine used throughout the procedure wa maintained at no more than 500mgsubmental suction assisted lipectomy  the incision wa made a previously outlined in the submental crease in a transverse direction through the skin and subcutaneous tissue and hemostasis wa obtained with bipolar cautery  a metzenbaum scissors wa used to elevate the area in the submental region for about 2 or 3cm and making radial tunnel from the angle of the mandible all the way to the next angle of the mandible  4mm liopsuction cannula wa then introduced along these previously outlined tunnel into the jowl on both side and down top the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid laterally and just past the thyroid notch interiorly  the tunnel were enlarged with a 6mm flat liposuction cannulathen with the wellsjohnson liposuction machine 2729 inch of underwater mercury suction wa accomplished in all tunnel  care wa taken not to turn the opening of the suction cannula up to the dermis but it wa rotated in and out taking a symmetrical amount of fat from each area  a similar procedure wa performed with the 4 mm

cervical mental angle  a plication stitch of 30 vicryl wa placedwhen a satisfactory visible result had been accomplished from the liposuction the inferior flap wa then advanced over anteriorly and the overlying skin excised in an incremental fashion  50 plain catgut wa used for closure in a running interlocking fashion  the wound wa cleaned at the end dried and mastisol applied  then tan micropore tape wa placed for support to the entire areaface lift  after waiting approximately 1015 minute for adequate vasoconstriction the post auricular incision wa started at the earlobe and continued up on the posterior aspect of the ear for approximately 2cm just superior to the external auditory canal  a gentle curve wa then made and again the incision wa carried down to and into the posterior hairline paralleling the hair follicle and directed posteriorly towards the occipital region  a preauricular incision wa carried into the natural crease superior to the tragus curved posterior to the tragus bilaterally then brought out inferiorly in the natural crease between the lobule and preauricular skin  the incision wa made in the temporal area beveling parallel with the hair follicle  the incision had been designed with curve underneath the sideburn in order to maintain the sideburn hair location and then curved posteriorlythe plane of dissection in the hairbearing area wa kept deep to the root of the hair follicle and superficial to the fascia of the temporalis muscle and sternocleidomastoid  the dissection over the temporalis muscle wa continued anteriorly towards the anterior hairline and underneath the frontalis to the supraorbital rim  at the superior level of the zygoma and at the level of the sideburn dissection wa brought more superficially in order to avoid the nerve and vessel in the area specifically the frontalis branch of the facial nervethe facial flap were then elevated with both blunt and sharp dissection with the kahn facelift dissecting scissors in the post auricular region to pas the angle of the mandible  this area of undermining wa connected with an area of undermining starting with the temporal region extending in the preauricular area of the cheek out to the jowl  great care wa taken to direct the plane of dissecting superficial to the parotid fascia or smas  the entire dissection wa carried in a radial fashion from the ear for approximately 4cm at the lateral canthal area to 810cm in the neck region  when the area of dissection had been connected carefully hemostasis wa obtained and all area inspected  at no point were muscle fiber or major vessel or nerve encountered in the dissectionthe smas wa sharply incised in a semilunar fashion in front of the ear and in front of the anterior border of the scm  the smas flap wa then advanced posteriorly and superiorly  the smas wa split at the level of the earlobe and the inferior portion wa sutured to the mastoid periosteum  the excess smas wa trimmed and excised from the portion anterior to the auricle  the smas wa then imbricated with 20 surgidak interrupted suturesthe area wa then inspected for any bleeding point and careful hemostasis obtained  the flap were then rotated and advanced posteriorly and then superiorly and incremental cut were made and the suspension point in the pre and post auricular area were done with 20 tycron suture  the excess and redundant amount of skin were then excised and trimmed cautiously so a not to cause any downward pull on the ear lobule or any stretching of the scar in the healing period  skin closure wa accomplished in the hairbearing area with 50 nylon in the preauricular tuft and 40 nylon interrupted in the post auricular area  the pre auricular area wa closed first with 50 dexon at the ear lobule and 60 nylon at the lobule and 50 plain catgut in a running interlocking fashion  50 plain catgut wa used in the post auricular area a well leaving ample room for serosanguinous drainage into the

point immediately a small bowel wa retracted cephalad  the patient wa taken to a slightly trendelenburg position and the descending colon wa seen  the white line of toldt wa opened all the way down to the area of inflammation  at this point meticulous dissection wa carried to separate the small bowel from the attachment to the abscess  when the small bowel wa completely freed of  abscess bulk of the bladder wa seen anteriorly to the uterus  the abscess wa cultured and sent it back to bacteriology department and immediately the opening into the bladder wa visualized  at this point the entire sigmoid colon wa separated posteriorly a well a laterally and it wa all the way down to sigmoid down to the rectum  at this point decision to place a moist towel and retract old intestine superiorly a well a to place first selfretaining retractor in the abdominal cavity with a bladder blade wa placed  immediately a gia wa fired right across the descending colon and sigmoid colon junction and then with peon within the mesentery were placed all the way down to the rectosigmoid junction where a ta55 balloon roticulator wa fired  the specimen wa cut with 10 blade bardparker and sent it to pathology  immediately copious amount of irrigation wa used and the staple line in the descending colon wa brought with allis  a pursestring device wa fired  the staple line wa cut  the dilator were used using 25 and 29 then  29 eea wa placed and the suture wa tied  at this point attention wa directed down to the rectal stump where dilator 25 and 29 were passed from the anus into the rectum and then the 29 ethicon gia wa introduced  the spike came posteriorly through the staple line to avoid the inflammatory process anteriorly that wa present in the area of the culdesac a well a the uterine wa present in this patient  immediately the eea wa connected with a mushroom  it wa tied fired and a doyen wa placed above the anastomosis approximately four inch  fluid wa placed within the  and immediately a colonoscope wa introduced from the patient anus insufflating air  no air wa seen evolving from the staple line  all fluid wa removed and picture of the staple line were taken  the scope wa removed at this point  the case wa passed to dr x for repair of the vesicle fistula  dr x did repair down the perforation of the bladder that wa communicating with an abscess secondary to the perforated diverticulitis and the colon  after this wa performed copious amount of irrigation wa used again  more lysis of adhesion were performed and decision to make a loop transverse colostomy wa made to protect the anastomosis in a phase of a severe inflammatory process in the pelvis in the infected area  the incision wa performed in the right upper quadrantthis incision wa performed with cutting in the cautery down into the fascia splitting the muscle and then the penrose wa passed under transverse colon and wa grasped on pulling the transverse colon at the level of the skin  the wire wa passed under the transverse colon  it wa left in place  moderate irrigation wa used in the peritoneal cavity and in the right lower quadrant a jp wa placed in the pelvis posteriorly to the abscess cavity that wa down on the pelvis  at this point immediately yellow fluid wa removed from the peritoneal cavity and the abdomen wa closed with cephalad to caudad and caudad to cephalad with a loop pd suture and then tied  electrocautery for hemostasis and the subcutaneous tissue  copious amount of irrigation wa used  the skin wa approximated with staple  at this point immediately the wound wa covered with a moist towel and decision to mature the loop colostomy wa made  the colostomy wa opened longitudinally and then matured with interrupted 30 vicryl suture through the skin edge  one it wa completely matured immediately the index finger wa probed proximally and distally and both loop were completely opened  a previously mentioned the penrose wa removed and the bard wa secured with a 30

now present with significant upper airway resistance and nasal obstruction and is unable to tolerate a cpap machine  therefore for repair of the abovementioned deformity including the internal and external nasal valve collapse a well a straightening of the deviated septum the risk and benefit of the procedure were discussed with him included but not limited to bleeding infection septal perforation need for further surgery external deformity and he desired to proceed with surgerydescription of the procedure in detail  the patient wa taken to the operating room and laid supine upon the or table  after the induction of general endotracheal anesthesia the nose wa decongested using afrinsoaked pledgets followed by the injection of  lidocaine with 1100000 epinephrine in the submucoperichondrial plane bilaterally  examination revealed significant deviation of the nasal septum and the bony cartilaginous junction a well a the large septal spur along the floor  the caudal septum appeared to be now in adequate position  there wa evidence that there had been a previous caudal septal graft on the right naris and it wa decided to leave this in place  following the evaluation of the nose a hemitransfixion incision wa made on the left revealing a large septal spur consisting primarily down on the floor of the left nostril creating nearly a picture of the vestibular stenosis on the side  very carefully the mucoperichondrial flap were elevated over this and it wa excised using an osteotome taking care to preserve the 15 cm dorsal and caudal strap of the nasal septum and keep it attached to the nasal spine  very carefully the bony cartilaginous junction wa identified and a small piece of the bone where the spur wa wa carefully removed  following this it wa noted that the cartilaginous region wa satisfactory in quantity a well a quality to perform adequate grafting procedure  therefore attention wa turned to harvesting the rightsided auricular cartilage which wa done after the region had adequately been prepped and draped in a sterile fashion  postauricular incision using a 15 blade the area of the submucoperichondrial plane wa elevated in order to preserve the nice lining and identifiable portion of the cartilage taking care to preserve the ridge of the helix at all time  this wa very carefully harvested  this area had been injected previously with 1 lidocaine and 1100000 epinephrine  following this the cartilage wa removed  it wa placed in saline noted to be fashioned in the bilateral spreader graft and alar rim graft a well a a small piece of crush which wa used to be placed along the top of the dorsal irregularity  the spreader graft were sutured in place using submucoperichondrial pocket  after an external septorhinoplasty approach had been performed and reflection of the skin and soft tissue envelope had been performed adequately revealing straight septum with significant narrowing with what appeared to be detached perhaps from his ipsilateral cartilage rather from his previous surgery  these were secured in place in the pocket using a 50 pd suture in a mattress fashion in two place  following this attention wa turned to placing the alar rim graft where pocket were created along the caudal aspect of the lower lateral cartilage and just along the alar margin  subsequently the alar rim graft were placed and extended all the way to the piriform aperture  this wa sutured in place using a 50 selfabsorbing gut suture  the lower lateral cartilage ha had some inherent asymmetry  this may have been related to his previous surgery with some asymmetry of the dome however this wa left in place a he did not desire any change in the tip region and there wa adequate support  an endodermal suture wa placed just to reenforce the region using a 50 pd suture  following all this the area wa closed using a mattress 40 plain gut on a keith needle followed by the application of  50 fastabsorbing gut to close the hemitransfixion incision  very carefully the skin and subcutaneous tissue envelope were reflected  the curvilinear incision wa closed using a vicryl followed by interrupted 60 prolene suture  the marginal incision were then closed using 50 fastabsorbing gut  doyle splint were placed and secured down using a nylon suture  they had ointment also placed on them  following this nasopharynx wa suctioned  there were no further abnormality noted and everything appeared to be in nice position  therefore an external splint wa placed after the application of steristrips  the patient tolerated the procedure well  he wa awakened in the operating room  he wa extubated and taken to the recovery room in stable condition ,2.0

flap reconstruction with subsequent deformity  in particular the patient ha had effacement of his alar crease with deepening of his nasolabial fold and notable asymmetry  the patient wa seen in consultation and felt to be a surgical candidate for improvement  risk and benefit of the operation were described to the patient in detail including but not limited to bleeding infection scarring possible damage to surrounding structure including neurovascular structure need for revision of surgery continued asymmetry and anesthetic complication  the patient understood these risk and benefit and consented to the operationprocedure in detail  the patient wa taken to or and placed supine on the operating table  dose of antibiotic wa given to the patient  compression device were placed on the lower extremity to prevent the knee embolic event  the patient wa turned to 180 degree  the ett tube wa secured and the area wa then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion  a head wrap wa then placed on the position and we then began our local  of note the patient had previous incision just lateral to his lateral canthus bilaterally and that were used for access  local consisting a 5050 mix of 025 marcaine with epinephrine and 1 lidocaine with epinephrine wa then injected into the subperiosteal plane taking care to prevent injury to the infraorbital nerve  this wa done bilaterally  we then marked the nasolabial fold and began with the elevation of the left midfacewe began with a lateral canthaltype incision extending out over his previous incision down to subcutaneous tissue  we continued down to the lateral orbital rim until we identified periosteum  we then pulled in a periosteal elevator and elevated the midface down over the zygoma elevating some lateral mesenteric attachment down over the buccal region until we felt we had reached pas the nasolabial fold medially  care wa taken to preserve the infraorbital nerve and that wa visualized after elevation  we then released the periosteum distally and retracted up on the periosteum and noted improved contour of the nasolabial fold with increased bulk over the midface region over the zygomawe then used our endotine coapt device to engage the periosteum at the desired location and then elevated the midface and secured into position using the coapt bioabsorbable screw  after this wa then carried out we then clipped and cut a well a the end of the screw  satisfied with this we then elevated the periosteum and secured it to reinforce our midface elevation to the lateral orbital rim and this wa done using 30 monocryl  several suture were then used to anchor the orbicularis and deeper tissue to create additional symmetry  excess skin along the incision wa then removed a well the skin from just lateral to the canthus  care wa taken to leave the orbicularis muscle down  we then continued closing our incision using absorbable plain gut 50 suture for the subciliarytype incision and then continuing with interrupted 60 prolenes lateral to the canthuswe then turned our attention to performing the zplasty portion of the case  a zplasty wa designed along the previous scar where it wa padding to the notable scar deformity and effacement of crease and the zplasty wa then designed to lengthen along the scar to improve the contour  this wa carried out using a 15 blade down to subcutaneous tissue  the flap were debulked slightly to reduce the amount of fullness and then transposed and sutured into place using chromic suture  at this point we then noted that he had improvement of the nasal fold but continued asymmetry with regard to improved bulk on the left side and le bulk on the right and it wa felt that a symmetrization procedure wa required to make more symmetry with the midface bilaterally and nasolabial fold bilaterally  a such we then carried out the dissection after injecting local a noted and we used a 15 blade scalpel to create our incision along the lateral canthus along it preexisting incision  we carried this down to the lateral orbital rim again elevating the periosteum taking care to preserve infraorbital nerveat this point we then released the periosteum distally just at the level of the nasolabial fold and placed our endotine midface implant into the desired area and then elevated slightly just for symmetry only  this wa then secured in place using the bioabsorbable screw and then resected a very marginal amount of tissue just for removal of the dog ear deformity and closed the deeper layer of tissue using 30 pd and then closing the extension to the subciliary area using 50 plain gut and then 60 prolene lateral to the canthusat this point we felt that we had achieved improved contour improved symmetry and decreased effacement of the nasolabial fold and alar crease  satisfied with our procedure we then placed cool compress on to the eyesthe patient wa then extubated and brought to the pacu in stable conditiondr x

gerd and postprandial vomiting including nuclear gastric emptying study which showed increased esophageal retention with normal gastric emptying  preoperative barium swallow demonstrated moderated esophageal dysmotility with incomplete emptying and a small hiatal hernia  it wa recommended that she undergo an exploratory laparotomy and possible redo fundoplication and possible gastrectomy  she had already undergone multiple egds with dilatation without success  she continued to have abdominal discomforton 07072008 she wa admitted to hospital  she underwent an exploratory laparotomy with esophagogastrectomy with esophagogastric anastomosis and dor fundoplication repair of hiatal hernia small bowel resection x2 with primary anastomosis extensive lysis of adhesion insertion of a redrubber j tube and esophagogastroduodenoscopy  she also had her ileojejunal bypass reversed  postoperatively she wa able to be extubated  she wa started on tpn given the risk of not being able to tolerate enteral nutrition  her operative note confirmed that the stomach pouch wa enlarged with outlet obstruction where the band wa  there wa 2 hour of extensive lysis of adhesion  it took 2 hour to identify the colon  a defect wa repaired in the transverse colon  the bypass segment of the anastomosis wa seen between the proximal jejunum and the distal ileum which wa divided and the proximal jejunum wa reconnected to the atretic blind limb of the small bowel  a red feeding tube wa placed proximal to the anastomosis then tended to cross the anastomosis into the distal atretic small bowel for enteral feed  the hiatal hernia wa repaired a noted  the obstructed proximal gastric segment wa resected  an anastomosis wa made between the proximal intestine and the stomach and distal esophagus with dor fundoplication  omentectomy wa performed due to devascularization  the wound wa able to be closed with staplespostoperatively the patient wa started on iv antibiotic  she wa able to be extubated  however on 07142008 she coded with shortness of breath and chest pain  she had respiratory failure required endotracheal intubation and icu management  ct scan of the abdomen and the pelvis confirmed that she had an anastomotic leak  sputum culture were positive esbl klebsiella  blood culture were negative  she wa managed closely for sepsis with an elevated white cell count  she wa also febrile  her chest xray also showed left lower lobe consolidation  she had scattered contrast material in the anterior abdomen and left upper quadrant due to the anastomotic leak  her antibiotic were adjusted  of note the patient did have a jp drain placed out to the surface during her initial surgery  followup ct scan on 07162008 confirmed the anastomosis a the likely site of a fistula a there wa continued extraluminal enteric contrast seen within anterior abdomen just beneath the peritoneum a well a the left upper quadrant adjacent to the spleen  no enteric contrast wa seen surrounding the patient known ge junction leak  a jp drain wa noted at the posterior aspect of the fundoplication  there wa only a small amount of pelvic fluid  follow up scan again on 07252008 showed no abscess formation  on 08052008 she did underwent an advancement of the 14 french redrubber catheter feeding tube distal to the dehiscence of fistula into the distal small bowel  at the beginning of the procedure the catheter did appear to traverse through an anastomotic suture line in the wound dehiscence  at some point during her course the patient did undergo a second operative procedure but i do not have any operative note at this time  she subsequently wa left with a large open abdominal defect which wa being managed by the wound care nurse which at the time of her transfer to this facility wa being managed with a wound manager system to lowcontinuous wall suction  she wa also transferred on tube feeding via the red rubber catheter 20 ml per hour  she is only to have her tube feed increased by 10 ml a week to ensure tolerance  during her course she wa started on tpn  she wa transferred on tpn hereat the time of her transfer the patient wa no longer on iv antibiotic  she is on fragmin for dvt prophylaxis  during her course she did have to undergo a tracheostomy  this ha subsequently been removed and this site is healing  the tracheostomy wa removed on 08062008 i believe  at the time of her tracheostomy on 07222008 the patient also underwent a flexible bronchoscopy which showed some secretion in the left airway right wa clear which did not appear to be purulent  of note also pathology of her partial stomach resection showed helicobacter pylorus gastritis  there were no other significant abnormality noted in the small intestine or omentum  on 08112008 the patient wa

subsequently developed reflux associated with postprandial vomiting which wa found to be secondary to esophageal retention  on 07082008 she underwent exploratory laparotomy with esophagogastrectomy with esophagogastric anastomosis and dor fundoplication hiatal hernia repair small bowel resection and lysis of adhesion  she ha had a fairly rocky postoperative course and ha subsequently underwent some type of reexploration after she wa noted to have enteric content draining from her jp drain with confirmed anastomotic leak  she ha undergone placement on an ng tube  at present she is on enteral feed a well a tpn  during all these she also coded and had respiratory failure requiring vent management but this ha improved  her trach ha been removed and this site is healing  from the wound standpoint her largest problem at this point is the abdominal wound which is open  a wound manager system is currently in place which is connected to low intermittent wall suction for drainage of the enteral content still present at present the drainage is quite yellow in appearance  she ha no significant complaint of pain at this time  at some point in her note there wa mention of a negative pressure wound therapy being used to this wound but this cannot be confirmed at this time  i will plan to contact dr z office to see whether or not they wanted to resume a wound vac system to this wound  for now we will continue with wound manager system  we will need to keep track of in and out of drainage from this site  her fluid status will need to be monitored  in an attempt to get her mobilized we will need extra care to be sure that this wound dressingmanagement system stay in place  she is eager and motivated to get mobilized  we will plan to ask plastic dr a to be involved in following this wound also  again i will plan to call the surgeon office for further direction  she is to follow up with dr z in 2 weekslater in afternoon i wa able to reach dr z office  i wa called back by one of his nurse who advised me that a wound vac negative pressure wound therapy wa not to be used on this wound  they are using the wound manager system  she did report that the confusion came about with the inability during her discharge summary dictation that she wa only able to cite a wound vac when describing the system that wa in place on the patient  she wa using a formatted discharge summary program  at present the patient ha had some leakage from the system  according to my discussion with our wound care coordinator at this time this system ha been removed with leakage repaired and replaced with another wound manager system with suctioning continuing  picture were also taken of the wound bed  there were several staple apparently in place  i wa not present at the

excision of nerve lesion in the left third interspaceanesthesia  monitored iv sedation with localhistory  this is a 37yearold female who present to abcds preoperative holding area npo since mid night last night for surgery of her painful left second and third interspaces and her left fifth metatarsal  the patient ha attempted conservative correction and injection with minimal improvement  the patient desire surgical correction at this time  the patient state that her pain ha been increasingly worsening with activity and with time and it is currently difficult for her to ambulate and wear shoe  at this time the patient desire surgical intervention and correction  the risk versus benefit of the procedure have been explained to the patient in detail by dr x and consent wa obtainedprocedure in detail  after an iv wa instituted by the department of anesthesia in the preoperative holding area the patient wa taken to the operating suite via cart and placed on the operating table in the supine position  a safety strap wa placed across her waist for protectionnext a pneumatic ankle tourniquet wa applied around her left ankle over copious amount of webril for the patient protection  after adequate iv sedation wa administered by the department of anesthesia a total of 20 cc of a mixture of 45 cc of 1 lidocaine plain 45 cc of 05 marcaine plain and 1 cc of solumedrol per 10 cc dose wa administered to the patient for local anesthesia  the foot wa then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic manner  the foot wa then elevated and a tourniquet wa then placed at 230 mmhg after applying esmarch bandage  the foot wa then lowered down the operative field and sterile stockinet wa draped  the stockinet wa then reflected  attention wa then directed to the second intermetatarsal interspace  after testing the anesthesia a 4 cm incision wa placed using a 10 blade over the dorsal surface of the foot in the second intermetatarsal space beginning from proximal third of the metatarsal distally to and beyond the metatarsal head  then using 15 blade the incision wa deepened through the skin into the subcutaneous tissue  care wa taken to identify and avoid or to cauterize any local encountered vascular structure  incision wa deepened using the combination of blunt and dull dissection using mayo scissors hemostat and a 15 blade  the incision wa deepened distally down to the level of the deep transverse metatarsal ligament which wa reflected and exposure of the intermetatarsal space wa appreciated  the individual branch of the plantar digital nerve were identified extending into the second and third digit plantarly  these ending were dissected distally and cut at their most distal portion  following this the nerve wa dissected proximally into the common nerve and dissected proximally into the proximal portion of the intermetatarsal space  using careful meticulous dissection there wa noted to a be a enlarged bulbous mass of fiber and nerve tissue embedded with the adipose tissue  this wa also cut and removed  the proximal portion of the nerve stump wa identified and care wa taken to suture this into the lumbrical muscle to leave no free nerve ending exposed  following this the interspace wa irrigated with copious amount of sterile saline and interspace explored for any other portion of nerve which may been missed on the previous dissection  it wa noted that no other portion of the nerve were detectable and the proximal free nerve ending wa embedded and found to be  the lumbrical muscle belly  following this the interspace wa packed using iodoform gauze packing and wa closed in layer with the packing extruding from the wound  attention wa then directed to the third interspace where in a manner a mentioned before  a dorsal linear incision which measured 5 cm wa made over the third interspace extending from the proximal portion of the metatarsal distally to the metatarsal head  like before using a combination of blunt and dull dissection with sharp dissection the incision wa deepened down with care taken to cauterize all retracting vascular structure which were encounteredthe incision wa deepened down to the level of the subcutaneous tissue and then down deeper to the interspace of the third and fourth metatarsal  the dissection wa deepened distally down to the level of the transverse intermetatarsal ligament where upon this wa reflected and the nerve fiber to the third and fourth digit plantarly were identified  these were once again dissected distally out and transected at their most distal portion  care wa then taken to dissect the nerve proximally into the proximal metatarsal region  no other branch of the nerve were identified and the nerve in it entirety along with fibrous tissue encountered in the area wa removed  the proximal portion of the nerve which remained wa not large enough to suture into lumbrical muscle a wa done in the previous interspace  half of the nerve wa transected proximally a wa feasible and no exposed ending wa noted  incision wa then flushed and irrigated using sterile saline  following this the incision wound wa packed with iodoform gauze packed and closed in layer using a before 40 vicryl and 40 nylon suturefollowing this attention wa directed to the fifth metatarsal head where a lateral 4 cm incision wa placed along the lateral distal shaft and head of the fifth metatarsal using a fresh 10 blade  the incision wa then deepened using 15 blade down to the level of the subcutaneous tissue  care wa taken to reflect any neurovascular structure which were encountered  following this the incision wa deepened down to the level of the periosteum and periosteum wa reflected using the sharp dissection to expose the head of the metatarsal along with the neck region  after adequate exposure of the fifth metatarsal head wa achieved an oblique incision directed from distal lateral to proximal medial in a sagittal plane wa performed and the head of the fifth metatarsal wa shifted medially  following this an orthosorb pin wa retrograded through the fifth metatarsal head into the neck of the fifth metatarsal and wa cut off first with the lateral surface of bone  orthosorb pin wa noted to be intact and the fifth metatarsal head wa in good alignment and position  following this the sagittal saw and the 138 blade were used to provide rasping and smoothing of the sharp acute edge of bone laterally  following this the periosteum wa closed using 40 vicryl and the skin wa closed in layer using 40 vicryl and closed with running subcuticular 40 monocryl suture  upon completion of this the foot wa noted to be in good position with good visual alignment of the fifth metatarsal head and digit  the incision in foot were then  draped in the normal manner using owen silk 4 x 4 kling and kerlix and covered with coban bandage  the tourniquet wa then deflated with the total tourniquet time of 103 minute at 230 mmhg and immediate hyperemia wa noted to end digit one through five of the left footthe patient wa then transferred to the cart and wa escorted to the postanesthesia care unit with vital sign stable and vascular status intact  the patient tolerated the procedure well without any complication  the patient wa then given prescription for vicoprofen 30 and augmentin 14 to be taken twice daily  the patient wa instructed to followup with dr x after the weekend on tuesday in his office  the patient also given postoperative instruction and wa placed in a postoperative shoe and instructed to limit weightbearing to the heel only ice

systemmonitoring  sseps and the eps were availableindications  the patient is a 12yearold female who ha had a very dysmorphic scoliosis  she had undergone a workup with an mri which showed no evidence of cord abnormality  therefore the risk benefit and alternative were discussed with surgery with the mother to include infection bleeding nerve injury vascular injury spinal cord injury with catastrophic loss of motor function and bowel and bladder control  i also discussed  and need for revision surgery  the mom understood all this and wished to proceedprocedure  the patient wa taken to the operating room and underwent general anesthetic  she then had line placed and wa then placed in a prone position  monitoring wa then set up and it wa then noted that we could not obtain motorevoked potential  the sseps were clear and were compatible with the preoperative but no preoperative motor had been done and there wa a concern that possibly this could be from the result of the positioning  it wa then determined at that time that we would go ahead and proceed to wake her up and make sure she could move her foot  she wa then lightened under anesthesia and she could indeed dorsiflex and plantarflex her foot so therefore it wa determined to go ahead and proceed with only monitoring with the ssepsthe patient after being prepped and draped sterilely a midline incision wa made and dissection wa carried down  the dissection utilized a combination of hand instrument and electrocautery and dissected out along the lamina and up to the transverse process  this occurred from t2l2  fluoroscopy wa brought in to verify position and level  once this wa done and all bleeding wa controlled retractor were then placed  attention wa then turned towards placing screw first on the left side  lumbar screw were placed at the junction of the transverse process and the facet under fluoroscopic guidance  the area wa opened with a high speed burr and then the track wa defined with a blunt probe and a balltipped feeler wa then utilized to verify all wall were intact  they were then tapped and then screw were then placed  this technique wa used at l1 and l2 both the right and left  at t12 a direct straightahead technique wa utilized where the facet wa removed and then the position wa chosen under the fluoroscopy and then it wa spurred the track wa defined and then probed and tapped and it wa felt to be in good position  two screw in the right and left were placed at t12 a well reduction screw on the left  the same technique wa used for t11 where right and left screw were placed a well a t10 on the left  at t9 a screw wa placed on the left and this wa a reduction screw  on the left at t8 a screw could not be placed due to the dysmorphic nature of the pedicle  it wa not felt to be intact therefore a screw wa left out of this  on the right a thoracic screw wa placed a well a at 7 and 6  this wa the dysmorphic portion of this  screw were attempted to be placed up they could not be placed so attention wa then turned towards placing pedicle hook  pedicle hook were done by first making a box out of the pedicle removing the complete pedicle feeling the undersurface of the pedicle with a probe and then seating the hook  upgoing pedicle hook were placed at t3 t4 and t5  a downgoing laminar hook wa placed at the t7 level  screw had been placed at t6 and t7 on the right  an upgoing pedicle hook wa also placed at t3 on the right and then downgoing laminar hook were placed at t2  this wa done by first using a transverse process lamina finder to go around the transverse process and then  laminar hook  once all hook were in place spinal osteotomy were performed at t7t8 and t8t9  this wa the level of the kyphosis to bring her back out of her kyphoscoliosis  first the ligamentum flavum wa resected using a large kerrisons  next the laminotomy wa performed and then a kerrison wa used to remove the ligamentum flavum at the level of the facet  once this wa accomplished a laminotomy wa performed by removing more of the lamina and to create a small wedge that could be closed down later to correct the kyphosis  this wa then brought out with resection of bone out to the foramen doing a foraminotomy to free up the foramen on both side  this wa done also between the t8t9  once this wa completed gelfoam wa then placed  next we observed and measured and contoured  the rod were then seated on the left and then a derotation maneuver wa performed  hook had come loose so the rod wa removed on the left  the hook were then replaced and the rod wa reseated  again it wa derotated to give excellent correction  hook were then well seated underneath and therefore they were then locked  a second rod wa then chosen on the right and wa measured contoured and then seated  next once this wa done the rod were locked in the midsubstance and then the downgoing pedicle hook which had been placed at t7 wa then helped to compress t8 a wa the pedicle screw and then this compressed the osteotomy site quite nicely  next distraction wa then utilized to further correct at the spine and to correct on the left the left concave curve which gave excellent correction  on the right compression wa used to bring it down and then in the lower lumbar area distraction and compression were used to level out l2  once this wa done all screw were tightened  fluoroscopy wa then brought in to verify l1 wa level and the first rib were also level and it gave a nice balanced spine  everything wa copiously irrigated   next a wakeup test wa performed and the patient wa then noted to flex and extend the knee a well a dorsiflex and plantar flex both the foot  the patient wa then again sedated and brought back under general anesthesia  next a highspeed burr wa used for decortication  after final tightening had been accomplished and then allograft bone and autograft bone were mixed together with 10 ml of iliac crest aspirate and were placed into the wound  the open canal area had been protected with gelfoam  once this wa accomplished the deep fascia wa closed with multiple figureofeight 1 oversewn with a running 1  were then placed in the subcutaneous space which were then closed with 30 vicryl and then the skin wa closed with 30 monocryl and dermabond  sterile dressing wa applied  drain had been placed in the subcutaneous layer x2  the patient

after adequate anesthesia wa achieved a curvilinear incision wa made in the right pelvic fossa approximately 9 cm in length extending from the 15 cm medial of the asis down to the suprapubic space  after this wa taken down with a 10 blade electrocautery wa used to take down tissue down to the layer of the subcutaneous fat  camper and scarpas were dissected with electrocautery  hemostasis wa achieved throughout the tissue plain with electrocautery  the external oblique aponeurosis wa identified with musculature and wa entered with electrocautery  then hemostat were entered in and dissection continued down with electrocautery down through the external internal oblique and the transversalis fascia  additionally the rectus sheath wa entered in a linear fashion  after these plane were entered using electrocautery the retroperitoneum wa dissected free from the transversalis fascia using blunt dissection  after the peritoneum and peritoneal structure were moved medially and superiorly by blunt dissection the dissection continued down bluntly throughout the tissue plane removing some alveolar tissue over the right iliac artery  upon entering through the transversalis fascia the epigastric vessel were identified and doubly ligated and tied with 0 silk tie  after the ligation of the epigastric vessel the peritoneum wa bluntly dissected and all peritoneal structure were bluntly dissected to a superior and medial plane  this wa done without any complication and without entering the peritoneum grossly  the round ligament wa identified and doubly ligated at this time with 0 silk tie a well  the dissection continued down now to layer of the alveolar tissue covering the right iliac artery  this alveolar tissue wa cleared using blunt dissection a well a electrocautery  after the external iliac artery wa identified it wa cleared circumferentially all the way around and noted to have good flow and had good arterial texture  the right iliac vein wa then identified and this wa cleared again using electrocautery and blunt dissection  after the right iliac vein wa identified and cleared off all the alveolar tissue it wa circumferentially cleared a well  an additional perforating branch wa noted at the inferior pole of the right iliac vein  this wa tied with a 0 silk tie and secured  hemostasis wa achieved at this time and the tie had adequate control  the dissection continued down and identified all other vital structure in this area  careful preservation of all vital structure wa carried out throughout the dissection  at this time satinsky clamp wa placed over the right iliac vein  this wa then opened using a 11 blade approximately 1 cm in length  the heparinized saline wa placed and irrigated throughout the inside of the vein and the kidney wa pulled into the abdominal field still covered in it protective socking with the superior pole marked  the renal vein wa then elevated and identified in this area  a 50 doubleended prolene stitch wa used to secure the renal vein both superiorly and inferiorly and after appropriately being secured with 50 prolene these were tied down and secured  the renal vein wa then anastomosed to the right iliac vein in a circumferential manner in a running fashion until secured at both superior and inferior pole  the dissection then continued down and the iliac artery wa then anastomosed to the renal artery at this time using a similar method with 50 prolene securing both superior and inferior pole  after such time the 50 prolene wa run around in a circumferential manner until secured in both superior and inferior pole once again  after this wa done and the artery wa secured the satinsky clamp wa removed and a bulldog placed over  the flow wa then opened on the arterial side and then opened on the venous side to allow for proper flow  the bulldog wa then placed back on the renal vein and allowed for the hyperperfusion of the kidney  the kidney pinked up nicely and had a good appearance to it and had appearance of good blood flow  at this time all satinsky clamp were removed and all bulldog clamp were removed  the dissection then continued down to the layer of the bladder at which time the bladder wa identified  appropriate area on the dome the bladder wa identified for entry  this wa entered using electrocautery and approximately 1 cm length after appropriately sizing and incising of the ureter using the metzenbaum scissors in a linear fashion  before this wa done 0 chromic catgut stitch were placed and secured laterally and inferiorly on the dome of the bladder to elevate the area of the bladder and then the bladder wa entered using the electrocautery approximately 1 cm in length  at this time a renal stent wa placed into the ureter and secured superiorly and the stent wa then placed into the bladder and secured a well  subsequently the superior and inferior pole stitch with 50 prolene were used to secure the ureter to the bladder  this wa then run mucosatomucosa in a circumferential manner until secured in both superior and inferior pole once again  good flow wa noted from the ureter at the time of operation  additional vicryl stitch were used to overlay the musculature in a seromuscular stitch over the dome of the bladder and over the ureter itself  at this time an ethibond stitch wa used to make an additional seromuscular closure and rolling of the bladder musculature over the dome and over the anastomosis once again  this wa inspected and noted for proper control  irrigation of the bladder revealed that the bladder wa appropriately filled and there were no flow and no defect  at this time the anastomosis were all inspected hemostasis wa achieved and good closure of the anastomosis wa noted at this time  the kidney wa then placed back into it new position in the right pelvic fossa and the area wa once again inspected for hemostasis which wa achieved  a 10 prolene stitch wa then used for mass closure of the external internal and transversalis fascia and musculature in a running fashion from superior to inferior  this wa secured and knot were dumped  subsequently the area wa then checked and inspected for hemostasis which wa achieved with electrocautery and the skin wa closed with 40 running monocryl  the patient tolerated procedure well without evidence of complication transferred to the dunn icu

3601,reason for visit  this is a cosmetic consultationhistory of present illness  the patient is a very pleasant 34yearold white female who is a nurse in the operating room  she know me through the operating room and ha asked me to possibly perform cosmetic surgery on her  she is very bright and well informed about cosmetic surgery  she ha recently had some neck surgery for a refusion of her neck and is currently on methadone for chronic pain regarding this  her current desire are that she obtain a breast augmentation and liposuction of her abdomen and she came to me mostly because i offer transumbilical breast augmentation  her breast are reportedly healthy without any significant problem  her weight is currently stablepast medical and surgical history   negative  past surgical history is significant for a second anterior cervical fusion and diskectomy in 0205 and in 0906  she ha had no previous cosmetic or aesthetic surgeryfamily history and social history  significant for huntington disease in her mother and diabetes in her father  her brother ha an aneurysm  she doe occasionally smoke and ha been trying to quit recently  she is currently smoking about a pack a day  she drink about once a week  she is currently a registered nurse circulator and scrub technician in the operating room at hopkins  she ha no childrenreview of system  a 12system review is significant for some musculoskeletal pain mostly around her neck and thoracic region  she doe have occasional rash on her chest and problem with sleep and anxiety that are related to her chronic pain  she ha considered difficult airway due to anterior cervical disk fusion and instability  her last mammogram wa in 2000  she ha a size 38c breastmedications  current medication are 5 mg of methadone three time a day and amitriptyline at night a neededallergies  nonefindings  on exam today the patient ha good posture good physique good skin tone  she is tanned  her lower abdomen ha some excess adiposity  there is some mild laxity of the lower abdominal skin  her umbilicus is oval shaped and of adequate caliber for a transumbilical breast augmentation  there wa no piercing in that region  her breast are c shaped  they are not ptotic  they have good symmetry with no evidence of tubular breast deformity  she ha no mass or lesion noted  the nipple are of appropriate size and shape for a woman of her age  her scar on her neck from her anterior cervical disk fusion is well healed  hopefully our scar would be similar to thisimpression and plan  hypomastia  i think her general physique and body habitus would accommodate about 300 to 350 cubic centimeter implant nicely  this would make her fill out her clothes much better and i think transumbilical technique in her is a good option  i have discussed with her the other treatment option and she doe not want scar around her breast if at all possible  i think her lower abdominal skin is of good tone  i think suction lipectomy in this region would bring down her size and accentuate her waist nicely  i am a little concerned about the lower abdominal skin laxity and i will discus with her further that in the near future if this continues to be a problem she may need a mini tummy tuck  i do think that a liposuction is a reasonable alternative and we could see how much skin tightening she get after the adiposity is removed  i will try to set this up in the near future  i will try to set this up to get the instrumentation from the instrumentation rep for the transumbilical breast augmentation procedure  due to her neck issue we may not be able to perform her surgery but i will check with dr x to see if she is comfortable giving her deep sedation and no general anesthetic with her neck being fused ,2.0

obtaining informed consent from the patient including a thorough explanation of the risk and benefit of the aforementioned procedure the patient wa taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia wa administered  next the patient chest and leg were prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion  a 10blade scalpel wa used to make a midline median sternotomy incision  dissection wa carried down to the level of the sternum using bovie electrocautery  the sternum wa opened with a sternal saw and fulldose heparinization wa given  next the chest retractor wa positioned  the pericardium wa opened with bovie electrocautery and pericardial stay suture were positioned  we then prepared to place the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass  a 20 ethibond double pursestring wa placed in the ascending aorta  through this wa passed our aortic cannula and connected to the arterial side of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine  next double cannulation with venous cannula wa instituted  a 30 prolene pursestring wa placed in the right atrial appendage  through this wa passed our sec cannula  this wa connected to the venous portion of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine in a yshaped circuit  next a 30 prolene pursestring wa placed in the lower border of the right atrium  through this wa passed our inferior vena cava cannula  this wa likewise connected to the y connection of our venous cannula portion  we then used a 40 ustitch in the right atrium for our retrograde cardioplegia catheter which wa inserted  cardiopulmonary bypass wa instituted  metzenbaum scissors were used to dissect out the svc and ivc which were subsequently encircled with umbilical tape  sondergaards groove wa taken down  next an antegrade cardioplegia needle and associated sump were placed in the

into view  of note wa the fact that the mitral valve p2 segment of the posterior leaflet had an abscess associated with it  the border of the p2 segment abscess were defined by using a right angle to define the chordae which were encircled with a 40 silk  after doing so the p2 segment of the posterior leaflet wa excised with a 11blade scalpel  given the laxity of the posterior leaflet it wa decided to reconstruct it with a 20 ethibond pledgeted suture  this wa done so a to reconstruct the posterior annular portion  prior to doing so care wa taken to remove any debris and abscesstype material  the pledgeted stitch wa lowered into place and tied  next the more anterior portion of the p2 segment wa reconstructed by running a 40 prolene stitch so a to reconstruct it  this wa done without difficulty  the apposition of the anterior and posterior leaflet wa confirmed by infusing solution into the left ventricle  there wa noted to be a small amount of central regurgitation  it wa felt that this would be corrected with our annuloplasty portion of the procedure  next 20 nonpledgeted ethibond suture were placed in the posterior portion of the annulus from trigone to trigone in interrupted fashion  care wa taken to go from trigone to trigone  prior to placing these suture the annulus wa sized and noted to be a  size for the cosgrovegalloway suture band ring from medtronic  after a mentioned we placed our interrupted suture in the annulus and they were passed through the cg suture band  the suture band wa lowered into position and tied in place  we then tested our repair and noted that there wa very mild regurgitation  we subsequently removed our selfretaining retractor  we closed our left atriotomy using 40 prolene in a running fashion  this wa done without difficulty  we deaired the heart  we then gave another round of antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia in warm fashion  the aortic crossclamp wa removed and the heart gradually resumed electromechanical activity  we then removed our retrograde cardioplegia catheter from the coronary sinus and buttressed this site with a 50 prolene  we placed 2 ventricular and 2 atrial pacing lead which were brought out through the skin  the patient wa gradually weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass and our venous cannula were removed  we then gave fulldose protamine and after noting that there wa no evidence of a protamine reaction we removed our aortic cannula  this site wa buttressed with a 40 prolene on an sh needle  the patient tolerated the procedure well  we placed a mediastinal 32french chest tube a well a a right chest blake drain  the mediastinum wa inspected for any sign of bleeding  there were none  we closed the sternum with 7 sternal wire in interrupted figureofeight fashion  the fascia wa closed with a 1 vicryl followed by a 20 vicryl followed by 30 vicryl in a running subcuticular fashion  the instrument and sponge count wa correct at the end of the case  the patient

1782,reason for hospitalization  suspicious calcification upper outer quadrant left breasthistory of present illness  the patient is a 78yearold woman who had undergone routine screening mammography on 060408  that study disclosed the presence of punctate calcification that were felt to be in a cluster distribution in the left breast mound at the 2 oclock position  additional imaging study confirmed the suspicious nature of these calcification  the patient underwent a stereotactic core needle biopsy of the left breast 2 oclock position on 061708  the final histologic diagnosis of the tissue removed during that procedure revealed focal fibrosis  no calcification could be identified in examination of the biopsy material including radiograph taken of the preserved tissuetwo day post stereotactic core needle biopsy however the patient returned to the breast center with severe swelling and pain and mass in the left breast  she underwent sonographic evaluation and wa found to have a development of false aneurysm formation at the site of stereotactic core needle biopsy  i wa called to see the patient in the emergency consultation in the breast center  at the same time dr y wa consulted in interventional radiology  dr z and dr y were able to identify the neck of the false aneurysm in the left breast mound and this wa injected with ultrasound guidance with thrombin material  this resulted in immediate occlusion of the false aneurysm  the patient wa seen in my office for followup appointment on 062408  at that time the patient continued to have sign of a large hematoma and extensive ecchymosis which resulted from the stereotactic core needle biopsy  there wa however no evidence of reforming of the false aneurysm  there wa no evidence of any pulsatile mass in the left breast mound or on the left chest walli discussed the issue with the patient and her husband  the underlying problem is that the suspicious calcification which had been identified on mammography had not been adequately sampled with the stereotactic core needle biopsy therefore the histologic diagnosis is not explanatory of the imaging finding  for this reason the patient wa advised to have an excisional biopsy of this area with guidewire localization  since the breast mound wa significantly disturbed from the stereotactic core needle biopsy the decision wa to postpone any surgical intervention for at least three to four month  the patient now return to undergo the excision of the left breast tissue with preoperative guidewire localization to identify the location of suspicious calcificationsthe patient ha a history of prior stereotactic core needle biopsy of the left breast which wa performed on 012704  this revealed benign histologic finding  the family history is positive

revealing extrafocal extrathyroidal extension and extranodal extension in the soft tissue of his medullary thyroid cancer  the patient had been followed for a period of time and underwent rapid development of a left and right infraclavicular lymphadenopathy and central neck lymphadenopathy also with imaging study to suggest superior mediastinal disease  fineneedle aspiration of the left and right infraclavicular lymph node revealed persistent medullary thyroid cancer  risk benefit and alternative of the procedure discussed with in detail and the patient elected to proceed with surgery a discussed  the risk included but not limited to anesthesia bleeding infection injury to nerve lip tongue shoulder weakness tongue numbness droopy eyelid tumor come back need for additional treatment diaphragm weakness pneumothorax need for chest tube others  the patient understood all these issue and did wish to proceedprocedure detail  after identifying the patient the patient wa placed supine on the operating room table  the patient wa intubated with a number 7 nerve integrity monitor system endotracheal tube  the eye were protected with tegaderm  the patient wa rotated to 180 degree towards the operating surgeon  the foley catheter wa placed into the bladder with good return of urine  attention then wa turned to securing the nerve integrity monitor system endotracheal tube and this wa confirmed to be working adequately  a previous apron incision wa incorporated and advanced over onto the right side to the mastoid tip  the incision then wa planned around the old scar to be excised  a 1 lidocaine with 1 to 100000 epinephrine wa injected  a shoulder roll wa applied  the incision wa made the apron flap wa raised to the level of the mandible and mastoid tip bilaterally all the way down to the clavicle and sternal notch inferiorly  attention wa then turned to performing the level 1 dissection on the left  subsequently the marginal mandibular nerve wa identified over the facial notch of the mandible  the facial artery and vein were individually ligated and marginal mandibular nerve traced superiorly and perifascial lymph node freed from the marginal mandibular nerve  level 1a lymph node of the submental region were dissected off the mylohyoid and digastric  the submandibular gland wa appreciated and retracted laterally  the mylohyoid muscle appreciated  the lingual nerve wa appreciated and the submandibular ganglion wa ligated  the hypoglossal nerve wa appreciated and protected and digastric tunnel wa then made posteriorly and the lymph node posterior along the marginal mandibular nerve and into the parotid gland were then dissected and incorporated into the specimen for histopathologic analysis  the marginal mandibular nerve stimulated at the completion of this portion of the procedure  attention wa then turned to incising the fascia along the clavicle on the left side  dissection then ensued along the floor of the neck palpating a very large bulky lymph node before the neck wa identified  the brachial plexus and phrenic nerve were identified  the internal jugular vein identified and the mass wa freed from the floor of the neck with careful dissection and suture ligation of vessel  attention wa then turned to the central neck  the strap muscle were appreciated in the midline  there wa a large firm mass measuring approximately 3 cm that appeared to be superior to the strap musculature  a careful dissection with incorporation of a portion of the sternal hyoid muscle in this area for a margin wa then performed  attention wa then turned to identify the carotid artery and the internal jugular vein on the left side  this wa traced inferiorly internal jugular vein to the brachiocephalic vein  palpation deep to this area into the mediastinum and up against the trachea revealed a 15 cm lymph node mass  subsequently this wa carefully dissected preserving the brachiocephalic vein and also the integrity of the trachea and the carotid artery and these lymph node were removed in full and sent for histopathologic analysis  attention wa then turned to the right neck dissection  a posterior flap on the right wa raised to the anterior border of the trapezius  the accessory nerve wa identified in the posterior triangle and traced superiorly and inferiorly  attention wa then turned to identifying the submandibular gland  a digastric tunnel wa performed back to the sternocleidomastoid muscle  the fascia overlying the sternocleidomastoid muscle on the right side wa incised and the omohyoid muscle wa appreciated  the omohyoid muscle wa retracted inferiorly  penrose drain wa placed around the inferior aspect of the sternocleidomastoid muscle  subsequently the internal jugular vein wa identified  the external jugular vein ligated about 1 cm above the clavicle  palpation in this area and the infraclavicular region on the right revealed a firm irregular lymph node complex  dissection along the floor of the neck then wa performed to allow for mobilization  the transverse cervical artery and vein were individually ligated to allow full mobilization of this mass  tissue between the phrenic nerve and the internal jugular vein wa clamped and suture ligated  the tissue wa then brought posteriorly from the trapezius muscle to the internal jugular vein and traced superiorly  the cervical rootlet were transected after the contribution so the phrenic nerve all the way superiorly to the skull base  the hypoglossal nerve wa identified and protected a the lymph node packet wa dissected over the internal jugular vein  the wound wa copiously irrigated  valsalva maneuver wa given  no bleeding point identified  the wound wa then prepared for closure  two number 10 jps were placed through the

2559,history of present illness  the patient is a 68yearold woman whom i have been following who ha had angina  in any case today she called me because she had a recurrent left arm pain after her stent three day ago and this persisted after two sublingual nitroglycerin when i spoke to her  i advised her to call 911 which she did  while waiting for 911 she wa attended to by a physician who is her neighbor and he advised her to take the third nitroglycerin and that apparently relieved her pain  by the time she presented here she is currently painfree and is feeling wellpast cardiac history  the patient ha been having arm pain for several month  she underwent an exercise stress echocardiogram within the last several month with me which wa equivocal but then she had a nuclear stress test which showed inferobasilar ischemia  i had originally advised her for a heart catheterization but she wanted medical therapy so we put her on a betablocker  however her arm pain symptom accelerated and she had some jaw pain so she presented to the emergency room  on 081608 she ended up having a cardiac catheterization and that showed normal left main 80  mid lad lesion circumflex normal and rca totally occluded in the mid portion and there were collateral from the left to the right a well a right to right to that area  the decision wa made to transfer  her a she may be having collateral insufficiency from the lad stenosis to the rca vessel  she underwent that with drugeluting stent on 081608 with i believe three or four total placed and wa discharged on 081708  she had some left arm discomfort on 081808 but this wa mild  yesterday she felt very fatigued but no arm pain and today she had arm pain after walking and again it resolved now completely after three sublingual

angina characterized with arm pain who underwent recent left anterior descending percutaneous coronary intervention and ha now had recurrence of that arm pain post stenting to the left anterior descending artery and it may be that she is continuing to have collateral insufficiency of the right coronary artery  in any case given this unstable presentation requiring three sublingual nitroglycerin before she wa even pain free i am going to admit her to the hospital and there is currently no evidence requiring acute reperfusion therapy  we will continue her betablocker and i cannot increase the dose because she is bradycardic already  aspirin plavix valsartan lipitor and norvasc  i am going to add imdur and watch headache a she apparently had some on nitro paste before and we will rule out mi although there is a little suspicion  i suppose it is possible that she ha noncardiac arm pain but that seems le likely a it ha been nitrate responsive and seems exertionally related and the other possibility may be that we end up needing to put in a pacemaker so we can maximize betablocker use for antianginal effect  my concern is that there is persistent right coronary artery ischemia not helped by left anterior descending percutaneous coronary intervention which wa severely stenotic and she doe have normal lv function  she will continue the glucosamine for her arthritis

anterior a well a posterior osteophyte  the patient also had a rent in the attachment of the hip abductor and a partial rent in the vastus lateralis  this wa revealed once we removed the trochanteric bursahistory  this is a 56yearold obese female with a history of bilateral degenerative hip arthritis  she underwent a right total hip arthroplasty by dr x in the year of 2000 and over the past three year the symptom in her left hip had increased tremendously especially in the past few monthsbecause of the increased amount of pain a well a severe effect on her activity of daily living and uncontrollable pain with narcotic medication the patient ha elected to undergo the abovenamed procedure  all risk a well complication were discussed with the patient including but not limited to infection scar dislocation need for further surgery risk of anesthesia deep vein thrombosis and implant failure  the patient understood all these risk and wa willing to continue further on with the procedureprocedure  the patient wa wheeled back to the operating room 2 at abcd general hospital on 082703  the general anesthetic wa first performed by the department of anesthesia  the patient wa then positioned with the left hip exposed on the beanbag in the lateral position  kidney rest were also used because of the patient size  an axillary roll wa also inserted for comfort in addition to a foley catheter which wa inserted by the or nurse  all her bony prominence were well padded  at this time the left hip and left lower extremity wa then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for this procedure  at this time an anterolateral approach wa then performed first incising through the skin in approximately 5 to 6 inch of subcutaneous fat  the tensor fascia lata wa then identified  a selfretainer wa then inserted to expose the operative field  bovie cautery wa used for hemostasis  at this time a fresh blade wa then used to incise the tensor fascia lata over the posterior onethird of the greater trochanter  at this time a blunt dissection wa taken proximally  the tensor fascia lata wa occluded with a hip retractor  at this time after hemostasis wa obtained bovie cautery wa used to incise the proximal end of the vastus lateralis and removing the partial portion of the hip abductor the gluteus medius  at this time a periosteal elevator wa used to expose anterior hip capsule  a  wa then inserted over the femoral head purchasing of the acetabulum underneath the reflected head of the quadriceps muscle  once this wa performed homan retractor were then inserted superiorly and inferiorly underneath the femoral neck  at this time a capsulotomy wa then performed using a bovie cautery and the capsulotomy wa  and then edged over the acetabulum  at this point a large bone hook wa then inserted over the neck and with gentle traction and external rotation the femoral head wa dislocated out of the acetabulum  at this time we had an exposure of the femoral head which did reveal degenerative change of the femoral head and once the acetabulum wa visualized we did see degenerative change within the acetabulum a well a osteophyte formation around the rim of the acetabulum  at this time a femoral stem guide wa then used to measure proximal femoral neck cut  we made a cut approximately a fingerbreadth above the lesser trochanter  at this time with protection of the soft tissue an oscillating saw wa used to make femoral neck cutthe femoral head wa then removed  at this time we removed the leg out of the bag and homan retractor were then used to expose the acetabulum  a longhandle knife wa used to cut through the remainder of the capsule and remove the glenoid labrum around the rim of the acetabulum  with better exposure of the acetabulum we started reaming the acetabulum  we started with a size 44 and progressively reamed to a size 50  at the size 50 mm reamer we obtained excellent bony bleeding with good remainder of bone stalk both anteriorly and posteriorly a well a superiorly within the acetabulum  we then reamed up to size 52 in order to get bony bleeding around the rim a well a anterior and posterior within the acetabulum  a size 54 mm trilogy cup wa then implanted with excellent approach approximately 45 degree of abduction and 10 to 15 degree of anteversion dialed in  once the cup wa impacted in place we did visualize that the cup wa well seated on to the internal portion of the acetabulum  at this time two screw were the placed within the superior table for better approach securing the acetabular cup  at this time a plastic liner wa then inserted for protection  the leg wa then placed back in the bag  a bennett retractor wa used to retract the tensor fascia lata and femoral elevator wa used to elevate the femur for better exposure and at this time we began working on the femur  a rongeur wa used to lateralize over the greater trochanter  a box osteotome wa used to remove the cancellous portion of the femoral neck  a charnley awl wa then used to cannulate through the proximal femoral canal  a power reamer wa then used to ream the lateral aspect of the greater trochanter in order to provide maximal lateralization and prevent varus implantation of our stem  at this time we began broaching  we started with a size 10 and progressively worked up to a size 12 mm broach  once the 12 mm broach wa inserted in place it wa seated approximately 1 mm below the calcar  a calcar reamer wa then placed and the calcar wa reamed smoothly  a standard neck a well a a 28 mm plastic head wa then placed and a trial reduction wa then performed  once this wa performed the hip wa taken to range of motion with external rotation longitudinal traction a well a flexion and revealed good stability with no impingement or dislocation  at this time we removed 12 mm broach and proceeded with implanting our polyethylene liner within the acetabulum  this wa impacted and placed and checked to assure that it wa well seated with no loosening  once this wa performed we then exposed the proximal femur one more time  we copiously irrigated within the canal and then suctioned it dry  at this time a 12 mm porous proximal collared stem a femoral component wa then impacted in place  once it wa well seated on the calcar we double checked to assure that there wa no evidence of calcar fracture which there were none  the 28 mm zero neck length cobaltchrome femoral head wa then impacted in place and the morse taper assured that this wa well fixed by next the hip wa then reduced within the acetabulum and again we checked range of motion a well a ligamentous stability with gentle traction external rotation a well a hip flexion  we were satisfied with component a well a the alignment of the component  copious irrigation wa then used to irrigate the wound  1 ethibond wa then used to approximate the anterior hip capsule  1 ethibond in interrupted fashion wa used to approximate the vastus lateralis a well a the gluteus medius attachment over the partial gluteus medius attachment which wa resected off the greater trochanter  next a 1 ethibond wa then used to approximate the tensor fascia lata with figureofeight closure  a tight closure wa performed  since the patient did have a lot of subcutaneous fat multiple 20 vicryl suture were then used to approximate the bed space and then 20 vicryl for the subcutaneous skin  staple were then used for skin closure  the patient hip wa then cleansed  sterile dressing consisting of adaptic 4 x 4 abds and foam tape were then placed  a drain wa placed prior to wound closure for postoperative drainage  after the dressing wa applied the patient wa extubated safely and transferred to recovery in stable condition  prognosis is good

normal and the serum pregnancy test wa negative  there wa no level of thyroglobulin recorded on this  a urinalysis and comprehensive metabolic panel wa unremarkable  a chest xray wa obtained which i personally reviewed  there is a diffuse pattern of tiny nodule in both lung typical of miliary metastatic disease that is often seen in patient with metastatic thyroid carcinomaimpressionplan  the patient is a 16yearold young lady with a history of thyroid mass that is now biopsy proven a papillary  the pattern of miliary metastatic lesion in the chest is consistent with this diagnosis and is unfortunate in that it generally mean a more advanced stage of disease  i spent approximately 30 minute with the patient and her family today discussing the surgical aspect of the treatment of this disease  during this time we talked about performing a total thyroidectomy to eradicate a much of the native thyroid tissue and remove the primary source of the cancer in anticipation of radioactive iodine therapy  we talked about sentinel node dissection and we spent significant amount of time talking about the possibility of hypoparathyroidism if all four of the parathyroid gland were damaged during this operation  we also discussed the recurrent laryngeal and external laryngeal branch of the nerve supplying the vocal cord function and how they cane be damaged during the thyroidectomy a well  i answered a many of the family question a they could mount during this stressful time with this recent information supplied to them  i also did talk to them about the chest xray pattern which wa complete  a the film wa just on the day prior to my clinic visit  this will have some impact on the postoperative adjunctive therapy  the radiologist commented about the risk of pulmonary fibrosis and the use of radioactive iodine in this situation but it seems likely that is going to be necessary to attempt to treat this disease in the patient case  i did discus with them the possibility of having to take large dos of calcium and vitamin d in the event of hypoparathyroidism if that doe happen and we also talked about possibly sparing parathyroid tissue and reimplanting it in a muscle belly either in the neck or forearm if that becomes a necessity  all of the family question have been answered  this is a very anxious and anxiety provoking time in the family  i have made every effort to get the patient under schedule within the next 48 hour to have this operation done  we are tentatively planning on proceeding this upcoming friday afternoon with total thyroidectomy ,2.0

echocardiogram to ass his cardiac function  once he is off the vasopressor we will try lowdose beta blockade a tolerated to reduce his rate2  pulmonology  currently the patient is on full vent support with a rate of 20 tidal volume of 550 pressure support of 10 peep of 6 and fio2 of 60  we will wean his fio2 a tolerated to keep his saturation greater than 90 and wean his peep a tolerated to reduce preload compromise  we will keep the head of bed elevated and start chlorhexidine a swish and swallow for vap prevention3  gastrointestinal  the patient ha known mesenteric venous occlusion secondary to the thrombus formation at the portal vein a well a the smv  he is status post immediate resection of jejunum leaving a blind proximal jejunum and blind distal jejunum  we will maintain ng tube a he ha a blind stump there and we will preclude any further administration of any med through this ng tube  i will keep him on gi prophylaxis a he is intubated  we will currently hold his tpn a he is undergoing a large amount of volume change a well a he is undergoing electrolyte change  he will have a longterm tpn after this acute episode  his lfts are all normal currently  once he is postop tomorrow we will restart the angiomax for his venous occlusion4  renal  the patient currently is in the acute renal insufficiency with anuria and an increase in his creatinine a well a his potassium  his critical hyperkalemia which is requiring dosing of dextrose insulin bicarb and calcium we will recheck his potassium level after this cocktail  he currently is started to make more urine since being volume resuscitated with hespan a well a bicarb drip  hopefully given his increased urine output he will start to eliminate some potassium and will not need dialysis  we will reconsult nephrology at this time5  endocrine  the patient ha adrenal insufficiency based on lack of stem to cosyntropin  we will start hydrocortisone 50 q6h6  infectious disease  currently the patient is on broadspectrum antibiotic prophylaxis imperially  given his bowel ischemia we will continue these and appreciate id service input7  hematology  hematologically the patient ha a hypercoagulable syndrome also had hit secondary to his heparin administration  we will restart the angiomax once he is back from the or tomorrow  currently his inr is 22  therefore he should be covered at the moment

anterior a well a posterior osteophyte  the patient also had a rent in the attachment of the hip abductor and a partial rent in the vastus lateralis  this wa revealed once we removed the trochanteric bursahistory  this is a 56yearold obese female with a history of bilateral degenerative hip arthritis  she underwent a right total hip arthroplasty by dr x in the year of 2000 and over the past three year the symptom in her left hip had increased tremendously especially in the past few monthsbecause of the increased amount of pain a well a severe effect on her activity of daily living and uncontrollable pain with narcotic medication the patient ha elected to undergo the abovenamed procedure  all risk a well complication were discussed with the patient including but not limited to infection scar dislocation need for further surgery risk of anesthesia deep vein thrombosis and implant failure  the patient understood all these risk and wa willing to continue further on with the procedureprocedure  the patient wa wheeled back to the operating room 2 at abcd general hospital on 082703  the general anesthetic wa first performed by the department of anesthesia  the patient wa then positioned with the left hip exposed on the beanbag in the lateral position  kidney rest were also used because of the patient size  an axillary roll wa also inserted for comfort in addition to a foley catheter which wa inserted by the or nurse  all her bony prominence were well padded  at this time the left hip and left lower extremity wa then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for this procedure  at this time an anterolateral approach wa then performed first incising through the skin in approximately 5 to 6 inch of subcutaneous fat  the tensor fascia lata wa then identified  a selfretainer wa then inserted to expose the operative field  bovie cautery wa used for hemostasis  at this time a fresh blade wa then used to incise the tensor fascia lata over the posterior onethird of the greater trochanter  at this time a blunt dissection wa taken proximally  the tensor fascia lata wa occluded with a hip retractor  at this time after hemostasis wa obtained bovie cautery wa used to incise the proximal end of the vastus lateralis and removing the partial portion of the hip abductor the gluteus medius  at this time a periosteal elevator wa used to expose anterior hip capsule  a  wa then inserted over the femoral head purchasing of the acetabulum underneath the reflected head of the quadriceps muscle  once this wa performed homan retractor were then inserted superiorly and inferiorly underneath the femoral neck  at this time a capsulotomy wa then performed using a bovie cautery and the capsulotomy wa  and then edged over the acetabulum  at this point a large bone hook wa then inserted over the neck and with gentle traction and external rotation the femoral head wa dislocated out of the acetabulum  at this time we had an exposure of the femoral head which did reveal degenerative change of the femoral head and once the acetabulum wa visualized we did see degenerative change within the acetabulum a well a osteophyte formation around the rim of the acetabulum  at this time a femoral stem guide wa then used to measure proximal femoral neck cut  we made a cut approximately a fingerbreadth above the lesser trochanter  at this time with protection of the soft tissue an oscillating saw wa used to make femoral neck cutthe femoral head wa then removed  at this time we removed the leg out of the bag and homan retractor were then used to expose the acetabulum  a longhandle knife wa used to cut through the remainder of the capsule and remove the glenoid labrum around the rim of the acetabulum  with better exposure of the acetabulum we started reaming the acetabulum  we started with a size 44 and progressively reamed to a size 50  at the size 50 mm reamer we obtained excellent bony bleeding with good remainder of bone stalk both anteriorly and posteriorly a well a superiorly within the acetabulum  we then reamed up to size 52 in order to get bony bleeding around the rim a well a anterior and posterior within the acetabulum  a size 54 mm trilogy cup wa then implanted with excellent approach approximately 45 degree of abduction and 10 to 15 degree of anteversion dialed in  once the cup wa impacted in place we did visualize that the cup wa well seated on to the internal portion of the acetabulum  at this time two screw were the placed within the superior table for better approach securing the acetabular cup  at this time a plastic liner wa then inserted for protection  the leg wa then placed back in the bag  a bennett retractor wa used to retract the tensor fascia lata and femoral elevator wa used to elevate the femur for better exposure and at this time we began working on the femur  a rongeur wa used to lateralize over the greater trochanter  a box osteotome wa used to remove the cancellous portion of the femoral neck  a charnley awl wa then used to cannulate through the proximal femoral canal  a power reamer wa then used to ream the lateral aspect of the greater trochanter in order to provide maximal lateralization and prevent varus implantation of our stem  at this time we began broaching  we started with a size 10 and progressively worked up to a size 12 mm broach  once the 12 mm broach wa inserted in place it wa seated approximately 1 mm below the calcar  a calcar reamer wa then placed and the calcar wa reamed smoothly  a standard neck a well a a 28 mm plastic head wa then placed and a trial reduction wa then performed  once this wa performed the hip wa taken to range of motion with external rotation longitudinal traction a well a flexion and revealed good stability with no impingement or dislocation  at this time we removed 12 mm broach and proceeded with implanting our polyethylene liner within the acetabulum  this wa impacted and placed and checked to assure that it wa well seated with no loosening  once this wa performed we then exposed the proximal femur one more time  we copiously irrigated within the canal and then suctioned it dry  at this time a 12 mm porous proximal collared stem a femoral component wa then impacted in place  once it wa well seated on the calcar we double checked to assure that there wa no evidence of calcar fracture which there were none  the 28 mm zero neck length cobaltchrome femoral head wa then impacted in place and the morse taper assured that this wa well fixed by next the hip wa then reduced within the acetabulum and again we checked range of motion a well a ligamentous stability with gentle traction external rotation a well a hip flexion  we were satisfied with component a well a the alignment of the component  copious irrigation wa then used to irrigate the wound  1 ethibond wa then used to approximate the anterior hip capsule  1 ethibond in interrupted fashion wa used to approximate the vastus lateralis a well a the gluteus medius attachment over the partial gluteus medius attachment which wa resected off the greater trochanter  next a 1 ethibond wa then used to approximate the tensor fascia lata with figureofeight closure  a tight closure wa performed  since the patient did have a lot of subcutaneous fat multiple 20 vicryl suture were then used to approximate the bed space and then 20 vicryl for the subcutaneous skin  staple were then used for skin closure  the patient hip wa then cleansed  sterile dressing consisting of adaptic 4 x 4 abds and foam tape were then placed  a drain wa placed prior to wound closure for postoperative drainage  after the dressing wa applied the patient wa extubated safely and transferred to recovery in stable condition  prognosis is good

preoperative holding area after which the patient wa transferred to the operating room  epidural anesthesia and general endotracheal anesthesia were administered by dr a without any difficulty  the patient wa shaved prepped and draped using the usual sterile technique  a sterile 16french foley catheter wa then placed with clear urine drained  a midline infraumbilical incision wa performed by using a 10 scalpel blade  the rectus fascia and the subcutaneous space were opened by using the bovie  transversalis fascia wa opened in the midline and the retropubic space and the paravesical space were developed bluntly  a bookwalter retractor wa then placed  the area of the obturator lymph node were carefully inspected and no suspicious adenopathy wa detected  given this patient low gleason score and low psa with a solitary core biopsy positive the decision wa made to not perform bilateral lymphadenectomy  the endopelvic fascia wa opened bilaterally by using the metzenbaum scissors  opening wa enlarged by using sharp dissection  small perforating vein from the prostate into the lateral pelvic wall were controlled by using bipolar coagulation device  the dorsal aspect of the prostate wa bunched up by using 20 silk suture  the deep dorsal vein complex wa bunched up by using allis also and ligated by using 0 vicryl suture in a figureofeight fashion  with the prostate retracted cephalad the deep dorsal vein complex wa transected superficially using the bovie  deeper near the urethra the dorsal vein complex wa transected by using metzenbaum scissors  the urethra could then be easily identified  nearly twothird of the urethra from anteriorly to posteriorly wa opened by using metzenbaum scissors  this exposed the blue foley catheter  anastomotic suture were then placed on to the urethral stump using 20 monocryl suture  six of these were placed evenly spaced out anteriorly to posteriorly  the foley catheter wa then removed  this allowed for better traction of the prostate laterally  lateral pelvic fascia wa opened bilaterally  this effectively released the neurovascular bundle from the apex to the base of the prostate  continued dissection from the lateral pelvic fascia deeply opened up the plane into the perirectal fat  the prostate wa then dissected from laterally to medially from this opening in the perirectal fat  the floor of the urethra posteriorly and the rectourethralis muscle wa then transected just distal to the prostate  maximal length of ureteral stump wa preserved  the prostate wa carefully lifted cephalad by using gentle traction with fine forceps  the prostate wa easily dissected off the perirectal fat using sharp dissection only  absolutely no traction to the neurovascular bundle wa evident at any point in time  the dissection wa carried out easily until the seminal vesicle could be visualized  the prostate pedicle were controlled easily by using multiple medium clip in 4 to 5 separate small bundle on each side  the bladder neck wa then dissected out by using a bladder neck dissection method  unfortunately most of the bladder neck fiber could not be preserved due to the patient anatomy  once the prostate had been separated from the bladder in the area with the bladder neck dissection wa carried out posteriorly to develop a plane between the bladder and the seminal vesicle  this wa developed without any difficulty  both va deferens were identified hemoclipped and transected  the seminal vesicle on both side were quite large and a decision wa made to not completely dissect the tip off a it extended quite deeply into the pelvis  about twothirds of the seminal vesicle were able to be removed  the tip wa left behind  using the bipolar gyrus coagulation device the seminal vesicle were clamped at the tip sealed by cautery and then transected  this wa performed on the left side and then the right side  this completely freed the prostate  the prostate wa sent for permanent section  the opening in the bladder neck wa reduced by using two separate 20 vicryl suture  the mucosa of the bladder neck wa everted by using 40 chromic suture  small amount of bleeding around the area of the posterior bladder wall wa controlled by using suture ligature  the ureteral orifice could be seen easily from the bladder neck opening and wa completely away from the everting suture  the previously placed anastomotic suture on the urethral stump wa then placed on the corresponding position on the bladder neck  this wa performed by using a french  needle  a 20french foley catheter wa then inserted and the suture were sequentially tied down  a 15 ml of sterile water wa inflated to balloon  the bladder anastomosis to the urethra wa performed without any difficulty  a 19french blake drain

emergency department with complaint of left ankle pain and disfigurement  there wa no open injury  the patient fell approximately 10 foot off his liner landing on his left foot  there wa evidence of gross deformity of the ankle  an xray wa performed in the emergency room which revealed a grade iv hawkins classification talus fracture  he wa distal neurovascularly intact  the patient denied any other complaint besides pain in the ankleit wa for this reason we elected to undergo the abovenamed procedure in order to reduce and restore the blood supply to the talus body  because of it tenuous blood supply the patient is at risk for avascular necrosis  the patient ha agreed to undergo the abovenamed procedure and consent wa obtained  all risk a well a complication were discussedprocedure  the patient wa brought back to operative room 4 of abcd general hospital on 082003  a spinal anesthetic wa administered  a nonsterile tourniquet wa placed on the left upper thigh but not inflated  he wa then positioned on the beanbag  the extremity wa then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for this procedure  an esmarch wa then used to exsanguinate the extremity and the tourniquet wa then inflated to 325 mmhg  at this time an anteromedial incision wa made in order to perform a medial malleolus osteotomy to best localize the fracture region in order to be able to bone graft the comminuted fracture site  at this time a 15 blade wa used to make approximately 10 cm incision over the medial malleolus  this wa curved anteromedial along the root of the saphenous vein  the saphenous vein wa located  it tributary going plantar were cauterized and the vein wa retracted anterolaterally  at this time we identified the medial malleolus  there wa evidence of approximately 80 avulsion rupture of the deltoid ligament off of the medial malleolus  this wa a major blood feeder to the medial malleolus and we were concerned once we were going to do the osteotomy that this would later create healing problem  it is for this reason that the pedicle which wa attached to the medial malleolus wa left intact  this pedicle wa the anterior portion of the deltoid ligament  at this time a microchoice saw wa then used to make a box osteotomy of the medial malleolus  once this wa performed the medial malleolus wa retracted anterolaterally with it remaining pedicle intact for later blood supply  this provided u with excellent exposure to the fracture site of the medial side  at this time any loose comminuted piece were removed  the dome of the talus wa also checked and did not reveal any osteochondral defect  there wa some comminution on the dorsal aspect of the complete talus fracture and we were concerned that once we place the screw this would tend to extend the fracture site  it is for this reason we did the medial malleolar osteotomy to prevent this from happening in order to best expose the fracture site  at this time a reduction wa performed  the 70 partially threaded cannulated screw were used in order to fix the fracture  at this time a 32 mm guidewire wa placed going from posterolateral to anteromedialthis wa placed slightly lateral to the achilles tendon percutaneously inserted and then drilled in the according fashion across the fracture site  once this wa performed a skin knife wa then used to incise over the percutaneous insertion in order to accommodate the screw going in  a depth gauze wa then used to measure screw length  a cannulated drill wa then used to drill across the fracture site to allow the entrance of the screw  a 55 mm partially threaded 70 cannulated screw wa then placed with excellent compression at the fracture site  once this wa obtained we checked the reduction again using intraoperative xiscan in the ap and lateral direction  this projection gave u excellent view of our screw placement and excellent compression across the fracture site  at this time we bone grafted the area of comminution using 1 cc of dynagraft with crushed cancellous allograft  this wa placed using a freer elevator into the fracture site where the comminution wa  at this time we copiously irrigated the wound  the osteotomy site wa then repaired first clamped using two large tenaculum reduction clamp  two partially threaded 40 cannulated screw were then used to fix the osteotomy site and anatomical reduction wa performed with excellent compression across the osteotomy site with the two screw  next a 10 vicryl wa then used to repair the deltoid ligament which wa ruptured via the injury  a tight repair wa performed of the deltoid ligament  at this time again copious irrigation wa used to irrigate the wound  a 20 vicryl wa then used to approximate the subcutaneous skin and staple for the skin incision  at this time the leg wa cleansed adaptic 4 x 4 and kerlix roll were then applied  the patient wa then placed in a plaster splint for mobilization  the tourniquet wa then released  the patient wa then transferred off the operating table to recovery in stable condition  the prognosis for this fracture is guarded  there is a high rate of avascular necrosis of the talar body approximately anywhere from 4060 risk  the patient is aware of this and he will be followed a an outpatient for this problem ,2.0

dose is clearly not at maximum and he is tolerating the dose currently  the plan will be to increase him up to 50 mg in the morning and 75 mg at night for 2 week and then 75 mg twice daily  reviewed the possible side effect of higher dos of topamax they will monitor him for language issue cognitive problem or excessive somnolence  i also discussed his imaging study which showed significant destruction of the cerebellum compared to other area and despite this the patient at baseline ha a reasonable balance  the plan from ct standpoint is to continue stretching program continue with medical therapy unit  he may benefit from botoxin addition i reviewed the diastat protocol with parent and given the patient tends to go into status epilepticus each time they can administer diastat immediately and not wait the standard 2 minute or even 5 minute that they were waiting before  they are going to repeat the dose within 10 minute and they can call em at any point during that time  hopefully at home they need to start to abort these seizure or the higher dose of topamax will prevent them  other medication option would include keppra zonegran or lamictalfollowup  followup ha already been scheduled with dr y in february and they will continue to keep that date for followup ,1.0

present illness  the patient is a 52yearold male who is here for independent medical evaluation  the patient state that he work for abc abc a a temporary worker  he worked for abcd too  the patient main job wa loading and unloading furniture and appliance for the home  the patient wa approximately there for about two and a half week  date of injury occurred back in october  the patient stating that he had history of previous back problem ongoing however he state that on this particular day back in october he wa unloading an 18wheeler at abc and he wa bending down picking up box to unload and load  unfortunately at this particular event the patient had sharp pain in his lower back  soon afterwards he had radiating symptom down his right buttock all the way down to the lateral part of his leg crossing his knee  this became progressively worse  he also state that some of his radiating pain went down to his left leg a well  he noticed increase in buttock spasm and also noticed spasm in his buttock  he initially saw dr z and wa provided with some muscle relaxer and wa given some pain patch or lidoderm patch i believe  the patient state that after this treatment his symptom still persisted  at this point the patient later on wa referred to dr xyz through the workman comp and he wa initially evaluated back in april  after the evaluation the patient wa sent for mri wa provided with pain medication such a shortacting opioids  he wa put on restricted duty  the mri essentially came back negative but the patient continued to have radiating symptom down to his lower extremity and subsequently the patient wa essentially released by dr xyz in june with maximum medical improvementunfortunately the patient continued to have persistence of back pain and radiating symptom down to his leg and went back to see dr xyz again and at this point the patient wa provided with further medication management and sent for pain clinic referral  the patient also wa recommended for nerve block at this point and the patient received epidural steroid injection by dr abc without any significant relief  the patient also wa sent for emg and nerve conduction study which wa performed by dr abcd and the mri emg and nerve conduction study came back essentially negative for radiculopathy which wa performed by dr abcd  the patient state that he continues to have pain with extended sitting he ha radiating symptom down to his lower extremity on the right side of his leg increase in pain with stooping  he ha difficulty sleeping at nighttime because of increase in pain  ultimately the patient wa returned back to work in june and deemed with maximum medical improvement back in june  the patient unfortunately still ha significant degree of back pain with activity such a stooping and radicular symptom down his right leg worse than the left side  the patient also went to see dr x who is a chiropractic specialist and received eight or nine visit of chiropractic care without longterm relief in his overall radicular symptomsphysical examination  the patient wa examined with the gown on  lumbar flexion wa moderately decreased  extension wa normal  side bending to the right wa decreased  side bending to the left wa within normal limit  rotation and extension to the right side wa causing increasing pain  extension and side bending to the left wa within normal limit without significant pain on the left side  while seated straight leg wa negative on the lle at 90° and also negative on the rle at 90°  there wa no true root tension sign or radicular symptom upon straight leg raising in the seated position  in supine position straight leg wa negative in the lle and also negative on the rle  sensory exam show there wa a decrease in sensation to the s1 dermatomal distribution on the right side to light touch and at all other dermatomal distribution wa within normal limit  deep tendon reflex at the patella wa 24 bilaterally but there wa a decrease in reflex in the achilles tendon 14 on the right side and essentially 24 on the left side  medial hamstring reflex wa 24 on both hamstring a well  on prone position there wa tightness in the paraspinals and erector spinae muscle a well a tightness on the right side of the quadratus lumborum area right side wa worse than the left side  increase in pain at deep palpatory examination in midline of the l5 and s1 levelmedical record review  i had the opportunity to review dr xyzs medical record  also reviewed dr abc procedural note which wa the epidural steroid injection block that wa performed in december  also reviewed dr x medical record note and an emg and nerve study that wa performed by dr abcd which wa essentially normal  the mri of the lumbar spine that wa performed back in april which showed no evidence of herniated discdiagnosis  residual from low back injury with right lumbar radicular symptomatologyevaluationrecommendation  the patient ha an impairment based on ama guide fifth edition and it is permanent  the patient appears to have reaggravation of the low back injury back in october related to his work at abc when he wa working unloading and loading an 18wheel truck  essentially there wa a clear aggravation of his symptom with ongoing radicular symptom down to his lower extremity mainly on the right side more so than the left  the patient also ha increase in back pain with lumbar flexion and rotational movement to the right side  with these ongoing symptom the patient ha also decrease in activity of daily living such a mobility a well a decrease in sleep pattern and general decrease in overall function  therefore the patient is assigned 8 impairment of the whole person  we are able to assign this utilizing the fifth edition on spine section on the ama guide  using page 384 table 153 the patient doe fall under dre lumbar category ii under criterion for rating impairment due to lumbar spine injury  in this particular section it state that the patient clinical history and examination finding are compatible with specific injury and finding may include significant muscle guarding or spasm observed at the time of examination a symmetric loss of range of motion or nonverifiable radicular complaint define his complaint of radicular pain without objective finding no alteration of the structural integrity and no significant radiculopathy  the patient also ha decrease in activity of daily living therefore the patient is assigned at the higher impairment rating of 8 wpi  in the future the patient should avoid prolonged walking standing stooping squatting hip bending climbing excessive flexion extension and rotation of his back  his one time weight limit should be determined by work trial although the patient should continue to be closely monitored and managed for his pain control by the specific specialist for management of his overall pain  the patient although ha a clear low back pain with certain movement such a stooping and extended sitting and doe have a clear radicular symptomatology the patient also should be monitored closely for specific dependency to shortacting opioids in the near future by specialist who could monitor and closely follow his overall pain management  the patient also should be treated with appropriate modality and appropriate rehabilitation in the near future ,2.0

draped in normal sterile fashion  foley catheter wa inserted sterilely in the field  preoperative antibiotic were given within 30 minute of skin incision  a 10 cm lower abdominal incision wa made from the symphysis pubis towards the umbilicus  dissection wa taken down through scarpas fascia to the level of the anterior rectus sheath  the rectus sheath wa then incised and the muscle wa split in the middle  space of rectus sheath wa then entered  the bookwalter ring wa then applied to the belly and the bladder wa then retracted to the right side thus exposing the left obturator area  the lymph node packet on the left side wa then dissected  this wa done in a split and roll fashion with the flimsy tissue and the left external iliac vein wa incised and the tissue were then rolled over the left external iliac vein  dissection wa carried down from the left external iliac vein to the obturator nerve and up to the level of the pelvic sidewall  the proximal extent of dissection wa the left hypogastric artery to the level of the node of cloquet distally  care wa taken to avoid injury to the nerve  an accessory obturator vein wa noted and wa ligated  the same procedure wa done on the right side with dissection of the right obturator lymph node packet which wa sent for pathologic evaluation  the bladder subsequently wa retracted cephalad  the prostate wa then defatted up to the level of the endopelvic fascia  the endopelvic fascia wa then incised bilaterally and the incision wa then taken to the level of the puboprostatic ligament  vicryl stitch wa then applied at the level of the bladder neck in order to control the bladder back bleeder  a babcock wa then applied around the dorsal venous complex over the urethra and the kwire wa then passed between the dorsal vein complex and the urethra by passing by the aid of a right angle  a 0vicryl stitch wa then applied over the dorsal venous complex which wa then tied down and cinched to the symphysis pubis  using a knife on a long handle the dorsal venous complex wa then incised using the kwire a a guide  following the incision of the dorsal venous complex the anterior urethra wa then incised thus exposing the foley catheter  the 30 monocryl suture were then applied going outside in on the anterior aspect of the urethra  the lateral edge of the urethra were also then incised and two lateral stitch were also applied going outside end  the catheter wa then drawn back at the level of membranous urethra and a final posterior stitch wa applied going outside end  the urethra wa subsequently divided in it entirety  a foley catheter wa then taken out and wa inserted directly into the bladder through the prostatic apex  the prostate wa then entered cephalad and the prostatic pedicle were then systematically taken down with the right angle clip and cut  please note that throughout the case the patient wa noted to have significant oozing and bleeding partially from the dorsal venous complex pelvic vein and extensive vascularity that wa noted in the patient pelvic fatty tissue  throughout the case the bleeding wa controlled with the aid of a clip vicryl suture silk suture and tie direct pressure packing and floseal  following the excision of the prostatic pedicle the posterior dissection at this point wa almost complete  please note that the dissection wa relatively technically challenging due to extensive adhesion between the prostate and denonvilliers fascia  the seminal vesicle on the left side wa dissected in it entirety however the seminal vesicle on the right side wa adherently stuck to the denonvilliers fascia which prompted the excision of most of the right seminal vesicle with the exception of the tip  care wa taken throughout the posterior dissection to preserve the integrity of the ureter  the anterior bladder neck wa then cut anteriorly and the bladder neck wa separated from the prostate  following the dissection the 5french feeding tube were inserted bilaterally into the ureter thus insuring their integrity  following the dissection of the bladder from the prostate the prostate at this point wa mobile and wa sent for pathological evaluation  the bladder neck wa then repaired using vicryl in a tennis racquet fashion  the rest of the mucosa wa then everted  the ureteral orifice and ureter were protected throughout the procedure

cleft lip repair and she is here today for her cleft palate operation  we have discussed with the mother the nature of the procedure risk and benefit the risk included but not limited to the risk of bleeding infection dehiscence scarring the need for future revision surgery  we will proceed with surgerydetails of the procedure  the patient wa taken into the operating room placed in the supine position and general anesthetic wa administered  a prophylactic dose of antibiotic wa given  the patient proceeded to have bilateral pe tube placement by dr x from ear nose and throat surgery  after he wa done with his procedure the head of the bed wa turned 90 degree  the patient wa positioned with a shoulder roll and doughnut  a dingman retractor wa placed  the operative area wa infiltrated with lidocaine with epinephrine 1200000 a total of 3 ml and then i proceeded with the prepping and draping  the patient wa prepped and draped  i proceeded to do the palate repair  the nature of the palate repair wa done in the same way on the both side  i will describe one side  the other side wa done exactly in the same manner  the 2 hemiuvulas are placed holding from a single hook and infiltrated with lidocaine with epinephrine 1200000 triangle in the nasal mucosa wa previously marked  this triangle of nasal mucosa wa removed and excised  this wa done on both uvula  then an incision wa done at the level of the palatal cleft at the junction of the nasal and oral mucosa  a 1mm cuff of oral mucosa wa used to be able to approximate the nasal mucosa better  once the incision wa done up to the level of the hard palate the muscle wa dissected off the surrounding tissue 2 mm from the nasal and the oral mucosa  then i proceeded to place an incision at the alveolopalatal junction with the help of 15blade  the incision start at the maxillary tuberosity posteriorly and come anteriorly at the alveolopalatal junction through the full thickness of mucoperiosteal flap  then the flap wa lifted up with the help of a freer and then the remaining of the incision medially wa completed  hemostasis wa achieved with help of electrocautery and surgicel  the mucoperiosteal flap wa retracted posteriorly with the help of a freer elevator  the greater auricular foramen wa exposed and the pedicle skeletonized to allow medial retraction of the mucoperiosteal flap  then an osteotomy wa done at the level of the greater auricular foramen to allow mobilization of the pedicle medially a well a a small incision wa done in the periosteum around the pedicle  the pedicle carefully dissected to allow better mobilization of the mucoperiosteal flap medially  this procedure wa done on both side in the same manner and then  dissection wa done including dissection of the hard palate from the nasal mucosa it wa evident that the nasal mucosa would not reach medially to be placed together  at this point the decision wa made to proceed with vomer flap  the flap are  infiltrated the vomer with the help of lidocaine with epinephrine after an incision in the manner of an open book  the incision wa done with a 15c blade  the vomer flap were dissected and the mucosa wa moved laterally to approximate to the nasal mucosa of the hard palate  this wa approximated on both side with 50 chromic running and interrupted stitch and i proceeded to the remaining of the posterior aspect of the nasal mucosa with a 50 chromic and a 40 chromic  then 2 stitch of 40 vicryl were applied to the soft palate in the delaire manner through the full thickness of the mucosa and muscle on one side on the other side and then coming back on the mucosa to evert the edge of the soft palate  the remaining part of the soft palate wa placed together with 40 vicryl and 40 chromic interrupted stitch  the throat pack wa removed  the palate wa cleaned  the dingman retractor wa removed and a single stitch after infiltration of lidocaine without epinephrine at the level of the midline of the

3572,reason for referral  the patient wa referred to me by dr x of childrens hospital after he wa hospitalized for what eventually wa diagnosed a a conversion disorder  i had met the patient and his mother in the hospital and had begun getting information regarding his symptom and background at that time  after his discharge the patient wa scheduled to see me for followup service  this wa a 90minute intake that wa completed on 10102007 with the patient mother  i reviewed with her the treatment consent form a well a the boundary of confidentiality and she stated that she understood these conceptspresenting problem  please see the inpatient hospital progress note contained in his chart for additional background information  the patient mother reported that he continues with his conversion episode  she noted that they are occurring approximately 6 time a day  they consist primarily of tremor arching his back and by her report doing some gang sign during the episode  she reported that the conversion reaction had decreased after his hospitalization and he had none for 3 day but then they began picking up again  from information gathered from mother it would suggest that she frequently doe status check where she asks him how he is doing and that after she began checking on him more that he began having more conversion reaction  in term of what she doe when he ha a conversion reaction she reported that primarily that she try to keep him safe  she put a sheath under him because the carpeting is dirty  she remove any furniture she wrap his leg together so they do not knock together she sits with him and she give him attention and say calm down breathe and after it is over she continues to tell him to be calm and to breathe  she denied that she give them any more attention  i strongly encouraged her to stop doing status check a this likely is reinforcing the behavior  i also noted that while he certainly need to be kept safe that she doe not want to give a lot of attention to this behavior and that over time we will teach him way of coping with this independently  in regard to his mood she reported that his mood is quite good  she denied any sadness or irritability  she denied anhedonia  she report that he is a little bit hard to get up in the morning  he is going to bed at about 11 getting up at 8 or 9  no change in weight or eating were noted

the perinatal period  she described him a a fussy and active baby but he wa described a a cuddly baby  she noted that the pediatrician never expressed any concern regarding his developmental milestone  she reported that he is allergic to penicillin  serious injures or toileting problem were denied a were a history of seizuresfamily background  the patient currently life with his mother who is age 57 and with her partner who is age 40  they have been together since 1994 and he is the only father figure that the patient ha even known  the father wa previously in a relationship that resulted in an 11yearold daughter who visit the patient home every other weekend  the patient father whereabouts are unknown  there is no information on his family  mother stated that he discontinued his involvement in her life when she wa about 3 month pregnant with the patient and the patient ha never met him  a noted there is no information on the paternal side of the family  in term of the mother side of family the maternal grandfather died in his 60 due to what mother described a hardening of the artery and the maternal grandmother died in 2003 due to stroke  there were 4 maternal aunt one of them died at age 9 month from pneumonia one of them died at 19 year old from what wa described a a brain tumor and there are 3 maternal uncle  in term of family relationship it wa reported that overall the patient tends to get along fairly well with his parent who reported that the patient and her partner tend to compete for mother attention and she noted this is difficult at time  she reported that the patient and her partner do not really do anything together  mother reported that there is no domestic violence in the home but there is some marital conflict and this is may be difficult for the patient a it is carried on in spanish and he doe not speak spanish  there also is some stress in the home due to the stepdaughter a there are some concern that her mother may be involved in drug  the mother reported that she attended high school did not attend any college  she denied learning problem  she denied psychological problem or any drugalcohol history  in term of the biological father she reported he did not graduate from high school  she did not know of learning problem psychological problem  she denied that he had a drugalcohol history  there is a family history of alcoholism in one of the maternal uncle a well a in the maternal grandfather  it should be noted that the patient and his family live in a small 4bedroom apartment where privacy is very difficultsocial background  she reported that the patient is able to make and keep friend but he enjoys lifting weight skateboarding and that he recently had an opportunity to do rock climbing he really enjoyed that  i encouraged her to have him involved in physical activity a this is good for discharge the stress to encourage the weightlifting a well a the skateboarding  mother is going to check further information regarding the rock climbing that the patient had been involved in which wa at it sound like by her description a some sort of boy and girl type of club  abuse of drug or alcohol were denied  the patient wa not described a being sexually activeacademic background  the patient is currently in the 10th grade  at present he is on independent study which began after his hospitalization  the mother reported that the teacher who had come to school saw one of his episode and stated that they would not want him to be attending school  i spoke with her very clearly and directly regarding the fact that it wa probably not best for the patient to be on independent study that he needed to be returned to his normal school environment  he ha never had an episode at school and he need to be back with his peer back in a regular environment where he is under normal expectation  i spoke with her regarding my concern regarding the fact that he is unsupervised during the day and we do not want this turning into one big long vacation where he is not getting his work done and he get himself in trouble  normally he would be attending at high school  the mother stated that she would contact them a well a check into possibly a 504plan  she reported that he really doe not to go back to high school  he say the kid are bad however she denied that he ha any history of

that she would speak with a counselor  she noted however that he ha a history of not liking school and avoiding going to school  she noted that he is somewhat behind in his work due to the hospitalization  his grade traditionally are c  she denied any special education servicesprevious counseling  denieddiagnostic summary and impression  similar to my impression at the hospital it would appear that the patient clearly qualifies for a diagnosis of conversion disorder  it appears that there are multiple stressor in the family and that the mother is reinforcing his conversion reaction  i am also very concerned regarding the fact that he is not attending school and want him back in the normal school environment a quickly a possible  my plan is to meet the patient at the next session

dorsal hump which wa both bony and cartilaginous in nature2  the patient had marked hypertrophy of his nasalis muscle bilaterally contributing to the soft tissue dorsal hump3  the patient had a cshaped deformity to the left before he had tip ptosisindications for procedure  the patient is a 22yearold hispanic male who is status post blunt trauma to the nose approximately 9 month with the second episode 2 week following and suffered a marked dorsal deformity  the patient wa evaluated but did not complain of nasal obstruction and his main complaint wa his cosmetic deformity  he wa found to have a cshaped deformity to the left a well a some tip ptosis  the patient wa recommended to undergo an open septorhinoplasty to repair of this cosmetic defectoperation in detail  after obtaining a full consent from the patient identified the patient prepped with betadine brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position on the operating table  the appropriate esmarch wa placed and after adequate sedation the patient wa subsequently intubated without difficulty  the endotracheal tube wa then secured and the table wa then turned clockwise to 90 degree  three afrinsoaked cottonoids were then placed in nasal cavity bilaterally  the septum wa then injected with 3 ml of 1 lidocaine with 1100000 epinephrine in the subperichondrial plane bilaterally  then 50 additional ml of 1 lidocaine with 1100000 epinephrine wa then injected into the nose in preparation for an open rhinoplastyprocedure wa begun by first marking a columellar incision  this incision wa made using a 15 blade  a lateral transfixion incision wa then made bilaterally using a 15 blade and then the columellar incision wa completed using iris scissors with care not to injure the medial crus  however there wa a dissection injury to the left medial crus  dissection wa then taken in the subperichondrial plane over the lower lateral cartilage and then on to the upper lateral cartilage  once we reached the nasal bone a freer wa used to elevate the tissue overlying the nasal bone in a subperiosteal fashion  once we had completed exposure of the bony cartilaginous structure we appreciated a very large dorsal hump which wa made up of both a cartilaginous and bony portion  there wa also an obvious fracture of the right upper lateral cartilage  there wa also marked hypertrophy what appeared to be in the nasalis muscle in the area of the dorsal hump  the skin wa contributing to the patient cosmetic deformity  in addition we noted what appeared to be a small mucocele coming from the area of the fractured cartilage on the right upper lateral cartilage  this mucocele wa attempted to be dissected free most of which wa removed via dissection  we then proceeded to remove takedown of the dorsal hump using a rubin osteotome  the dorsal hump wa taken down and passed off the table  examination of the specimen revealed the marking amount of scar tissue at the junction of the bone and cartilage  this wa passed off to use later for possible onlay graft  there wa now a marked open roof deformity of the cartilage and bony sprue  a septoplasty wa then performed throughout and a kelly incision on the right side  subperichondrial plane were elevated on the right side and then a cartilage wa incised using a caudal and subperichondrial plane elevated on the left side  a 2 x 3cm piece of the cardinal cartilage wa then removed with care to leave at least 1 cm dorsal and caudal septal strut  this cartilage wa passed down the table and then 2 columellar strut graft measuring approximately 15 mm in length were then used and placed to close the bony and cartilaginous open roof deformity  the spreader graft were sewn in place using three interrupted 50 pd suture placed in the horizontal fashion bilaterally  once these were placed we then proceeded to work on the bony open roof  lateral osteotomy were made with 2mm osteotomes bilaterally  the nasal bone were then fashioned medially to close the open roof deformity and this reduced the width of the bony nasal dorsum  we then proceeded to the tip  a cartilaginous strut wa then fashioned from the cartilaginous septum  it wa approximately 15 mm long  this wa placed and a pocket wa just formed between the medial crus  this pocket wa taken down to the nasal spine and then the strut graft wa placed  the intradermal suture were then placed using interrupted 50 pd suture to help to provide more tip projection and definition  the intradermal suture were then placed to help to align the nasal tip  the cartilage strut wa then sutured in place to the medial crus after elevating the vestibular skin off the medial crus in the area of the plane suturing  prior to the intradermal suturing the vestibular skin wa also taken off in the area of the domethe columellar strut wa then sutured in place using interrupted 50 pd suture placed in a horizontal mattress fashion with care to help repair the left medial crural foot  the patient had good tip support after this maneuver  we then proceeded to repair the septal deformity created by taking down the dorsal hump with the rubin osteotome  this wa done by crushing the remaining cartilage in the morcellizer and then wrapping this crushed cartilage in endogen which is a radiated collagen  the autogenous cartilage wa wrapped in endogen in a sandwich fashion and then a 40 chromic suture wa placed through this to help with placement of the dorsal onlay graftthe dorsal onlay wa then sewn into position and then the 40 chromic suture wa brought out through this externally to help the superior placement of the dorsal onlay graft  once we were happy with the position of the dorsal onlay graft the graft wa then sutured in place using two interrupted 40 fastabsorbing suture inferiorly just above the superior edge of the lower lateral cartilage  once we were happy with the placement of this we did need to take down some of the bony dorsal hump laterally and this wa done using a 6 and then followed with a 3 push graft  this wrapping wa performed prior to placement of the dorsal onlay grafti went through content with the dorsal onlay graft and the closure of the roof deformity a well a placement of the columellar strut we then felt the patient could use a bit more tip projection and therefore we fashioned a radiated rib into a small octagon and this wa sutured in place over the tip using two interrupted 50 pd suturesat this point we were happy with the test result although the patient did have significant amount of fullness in the dorsal hump area due to soft tissue thick and fullness  there do not appear to be any other pathology causing the patient dorsal hump and therefore we felt we have achieved the best cosmetic result at this point  the septum wa reapproximated using a fastabsorbing 40 suture and a keith needle placed in the mattress fashion  the kelly incision wa closed using two interrupted 40 fastabsorbing gut suture  doyle splint were then placed within the nasal cavity and secured to the inferior septum using a 30 monofilament suture  the columellar skin wa reapproximated using interrupted 60 nylon suture and the marginal incision of the vestibular skin wa closed using interrupted 40 chromic suturesat the end of the procedure all sponge needle and instrument count were correct  a denver external splint wa then applied  the patient wa awakened extubated and transported to anesthesia care unit in good condition ,2.0

this 62yearold man ha severe cervical spondylosis with myelopathy and cord compression at c5c6  there wa a herniated disk with cord compression and radiculopathy at c4c5  c3c4 wa the source of neck pain a documented by facet injectionsa detailed discussion ensued with the patient a to the pro and con of the surgery by two level versus three level  because of the severe component of the neck pain that ha been relieved with facet injection we elected to proceed ahead with anterior cervical discectomy and fusion at c3c4 c4c5 and c5c6i explained the nature of this procedure in great detail including all risk and alternative  he clearly understands and ha no further question and request that i proceedprocedure  the patient wa placed on the operating room table and wa intubated taking great care to keep the neck in a neutral position  the methylprednisolone spinal cord protocol wa instituted with bolus and continuous infusion dosagesthe left side of the neck wa carefully prepped and draped in the usual sterile mannera transverse incision wa made in the neck crease  dissection wa carried down through the platysma musculature and the anterior spine wa exposed  the medial border of the longus colli muscle were dissected free from their attachment to the spine  caspar selfretaining pin were placed into the body of c3 c4 c5 and c6 and xray localization wa obtained  a needle wa placed in what wa revealed to be the disk space at c4c5 and an xray confirmed proper localizationselfretaining retractor were then placed in the wound taking great care to keep the blade of the retractor underneath the longus colli musclesfirst i removed the large amount of anterior overhanging osteophyte at c5c6 and distracted the space  the highspeed cutting bur wa used to drill back the osteophyte towards the posterior lip of the vertebral bodiesan incision wa then made at c4c5 and the annulus wa incised and a discectomy wa performed back to the posterior lip of the vertebral bodiesthe retractor were then adjusted and again discectomy wa performed at c3c4 back to the posterior lip of the vertebral body  the operating microscope wa then utilizedworking under magnification i started at c3c4 and began to work my way down to the posterior longitudinal ligament  the ligament wa incised and the underlying dura wa exposed  i worked out laterally towards the takeoff of the c4 nerve root and widely decompressed the nerve root edge of the foramen  there were a large number of vein overlying the nerve root which were oozing and rather than remove these and produce tremendous amount of bleeding i left them intact  however i could to palpate the nerve root along the pedicle into the foramen and widely decompressed it on the right  the microscope wa angled to the left side where similar decompression wa achievedthe retractor were readjusted and attention wa turned to c4c5  i worked down through bony osteophyte and identified the posterior longitudinal ligament  the ligament wa incised and a i worked to the right of the midline i encountered herniated disk material which wa removed in a number of large piece  the c5 root wa exposed and then widely decompressed until i wa flush with the pedicle and into the foramen  the root had a somewhat high takeoff but i worked to expose the axilla and widely decompressed it  again the microscope wa angled to the left side where similar decompression wa achieved  central decompression wa achieved here where there wa a moderate amount of spinal cord compression  this wa removed by undercutting with 1 and 2mm cloward punchesattention wa then turned to the c5c6 space  here there were large osteophyte projecting posteriorly against the cord  i slowly and carefully used the highspeed cutting diamond bur to drill these and then used 1 to 2mm cloward punch to widely decompress the spinal cord  this necessitated undercutting the body of both c5 and c6 extensively but i wa then able to achieve a good decompression of the cord  i exposed the c6 root and widely decompressed it until i wa flush with the pedicle and into the foramen on the right  the microscope wa angled to the left side where a similar decompression wa achievedattention wa then turned to creation of the arthrodesis  a highspeed cornerstone bur wa used to decorticate the body of c5c6 c4c5 and c3c4 to create a posterior shelf to prevent backwards graft migration  bone dust during the drilling wa harvested for later useattention wa turned to creation of the arthrodesis  using the various synthes sizers i selected a 7mm lordotic graft at c5c6 and an 8mm lordotic graft at c4c5 and a 9mm lordotic graft at c3c4  each graft wa filled with autologous bone from the vertebral body and bone morphogenetic protein soaked sponge  i decided to use bmp in this case because there were three level of fusion and because this patient ha a very heavy history of smoking and having just recently discontinued for two week  the bmp sponge and the  bone were then packed in the center of the allograftunder distraction the graft wa placed at c3c4 c4c5 and c5c6 a described  an xray wa obtained which showed good graft placement with preservation of the cervical lordosisattention wa turned to the placement of anterior spinal instrumentation  various size of synthes plate were selected until i decided that a 54mm plate wa appropriate  the plate had to be somewhat contoured and bent inferiorly and the vertebral body had to be drilled so that the plate would sit flush  the hole were drilled and the screw were placed  eight screw were placed with two screw at c3 two screw at c4 two screw at c5 and two screw at c6  all eight screw had good purchase  the locking screw were tightly applied  an xray wa obtained which showed good placement of the graft plate and screwsattention wa turned to closure  the wound wa copiously irrigated with bacitracin solution and meticulous hemostasis wa obtained  a medium hemovac drain wa placed in the anterior vertebral body space and brought out through a separate stab incision in the skin  the wound wa then carefully closed in layer  sterile dressing were applied and the operation wa terminatedthe patient tolerated the procedure well and left for the recovery room in excellent condition  the sponge and needle count were reported a correct  there were no intraoperative

comment even though she know that he really cannot help it  she ha never provided him with any sort of reward because she feel that this is something he just need to learn to do  in regard to other

but doe work approximately 48 hour a month a a beautician with his father age 35 who is a police officer and also with his younger brother who is age 3 and ha significant medical problem a will be noted in a moment  mother and father have been together since 1997 married in 1999  the maternal grandmother and grandfather are living and are together and live in the central california coast area  there is one maternal aunt age 33 and then two adopted maternal aunt and uncle age 18 and age 13  in regard to the father side of the family the paternal grandparent are divorced  grandfather wa in

wa not so defiant that she find him to be a very stressful child to deal with  in regard to the relationship with the father it wa reported that the father tends to leave most of the parenting over to the mother unless she specifically asks him to do something and then he will follow through and do it  he will step in and back mother up in term of parenting tell the child not to speak to his mother that way etc  mother reported that he doe spend some time with the child but not a much a mother would like him to but occasionally he will go outside and do thing with them  the mother reported that sometimes she ha a problem in interfering with his parenting that she step in and defends the patient  it wa reported that mother stated that she try the parenting technique primarily of yelling and tried timeout although her description suggests that she is not doing timeout correctly a he simply get up from his timeout and she doe not follow through  mother reported that she and the patient are very much alike in temperament and this ha made thing more difficult  mother tends to be stubborn and get angry easily also  mother reported becoming fatigued in her parenting that she let him get away with thing sometimes because she doe not want to punish him all day long sometimes ignores problem that she probably should not ignore  there wa reported to be jealousy between the patient and his brother b  b evidently ha some heart problem and feeding issue and because of that tends to get more attention in term of his medical need and that the patient is very jealous of that attention and feel that b is favored and that he get thing that the patient doe not get and that there is some tension between the brother  they do play well together however the patient doe tend to be somewhat

but at this point in time there ha been no teasing regarding smell from the encopresis  he doe have kid over to play at the houseprevious counseling  denieddiagnostic summary and impression  my impression is that the patient ha a long history of constipation and impaction which ha been treated medically but it would appear that the mother ha not followed through consistently with the behavioral component of toilet sitting increased fiber regular medication so that the problem ha likely continued  she also ha not used any sort of reward a a way to encourage him in the encopresis  the patient clearly qualifies for a diagnosis of disruptive behavior disorder not otherwise specified and possibly oppositional defiant disorder  it would appear that mother need help in her parenting and that she tends to mostly use yelling and anger a a way and tends to repeat herself a lot and doe not have a strategy for how to follow through and to deal with defiant behavior  also mother and father may not be on the same page in term of parentingplan  in term of my plan i will meet with the child in the next couple of week  i also asked the mother to bring the father in so he could be involved in the treatment also and i gave the mother a behavioral checklist to be completed by herself and the father a well a the teacherdsm iv diagnosis  axis i  adjustment disorder with disturbance

2931,history of present illness  the patient is a 68yearold woman whom i have been following who ha had angina  in any case today she called me because she had a recurrent left arm pain after her stent three day ago and this persisted after two sublingual nitroglycerin when i spoke to her  i advised her to call 911 which she did  while waiting for 911 she wa attended to by a physician who is her neighbor and he advised her to take the third nitroglycerin and that apparently relieved her pain  by the time she presented here she is currently painfree and is feeling wellpast cardiac history  the patient ha been having arm pain for several month  she underwent an exercise stress echocardiogram within the last several month with me which wa equivocal but then she had a nuclear stress test which showed inferobasilar ischemia  i had originally advised her for a heart catheterization but she wanted medical therapy so we put her on a betablocker  however her arm pain symptom accelerated and she had some jaw pain so she presented to the emergency room  on 081608 she ended up having a cardiac catheterization and that showed normal left main 80  mid lad lesion circumflex normal and rca totally occluded in the mid portion and there were collateral from the left to the right a well a right to right to that area  the decision wa made to transfer  her a she may be having collateral insufficiency from the lad stenosis to the rca vessel  she underwent that with drugeluting stent on 081608 with i believe three or four total placed and wa discharged on 081708  she had some left arm discomfort on 081808 but this wa mild  yesterday she felt very fatigued but no arm pain and today she had arm pain after walking and again it resolved now completely after three sublingual

angina characterized with arm pain who underwent recent left anterior descending percutaneous coronary intervention and ha now had recurrence of that arm pain post stenting to the left anterior descending artery and it may be that she is continuing to have collateral insufficiency of the right coronary artery  in any case given this unstable presentation requiring three sublingual nitroglycerin before she wa even pain free i am going to admit her to the hospital and there is currently no evidence requiring acute reperfusion therapy  we will continue her betablocker and i cannot increase the dose because she is bradycardic already  aspirin plavix valsartan lipitor and norvasc  i am going to add imdur and watch headache a she apparently had some on nitro paste before and we will rule out mi although there is a little suspicion  i suppose it is possible that she ha noncardiac arm pain but that seems le likely a it ha been nitrate responsive and seems exertionally related and the other possibility may be that we end up needing to put in a pacemaker so we can maximize betablocker use for antianginal effect  my concern is that there is persistent right coronary artery ischemia not helped by left anterior descending percutaneous coronary intervention which wa severely stenotic and she doe have normal lv function  she will continue the glucosamine for her arthritis

engulfed the porta hepatis the workup began with gi bleeding he wa seen in my office on 011106 for preop evaluation due to leg edema a nonocclusive dvt wa diagnosed in the proximal left superficial femoral vein both leg were edematous and bilateral venous insufficiency wa also present an echocardiogram demonstrated an ejection fraction of 50 the patient wa admitted to the hospital and treated with a greenfield filter since anticoagulant wa contraindicated additional information on the echocardiogram where a grossly dilated left atrium moderately severely dilated right atrium the rhythm wa

insufficiency the ejection fraction wa considered low normal since it wa estimated 50 to 54 the patient received blood while in the hospital due to anemia the leg edema improved while lying down suggesting that the significant element of venous insufficiency wa indeed present the patient who wa diabetic received consultation by dr r he wa also a chronic hypertensive and wa treated for that with ace inhibitor the atrial fibrillation wa slow and no digitalis or beta blocker were recommended at the same time a a matter of fact they were discontinued now the patient denied any shortness of

control reason being is high likelihood for gi bleeding especially given the diagnosis of invasive malignancy with involvement of multiple organ and lymph node at this point i agree with the notion of hospice care if his atrioventricular conduction becomes excessive occasional nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker such a diltiazem or beta blocker would be appropriate otherwise i would keep him

catheter to take multiple cineangiograms of the right and left coronary artery  after using the jr4 6french catheter nitroglycerin wa administered because of the possibility of ostial spasm and following that we used a 5french jr4 catheter for additional cineangiograms of the right coronary artery  a pigtail catheter wa placed in the mid abdominal aorta and abdominal aortic injection wa performed to rule out abdominal aortic aneurysm a there wa dense calcification in the mid abdominal aortaanalysis of pressure data  left ventricular enddiastolic pressure wa 5 mmhg  on continuous

selective cineangiograms were obtained with injection of contrast to the left ventricle coronary artery and mid abdominal aorta  a pigtail catheter wa introduced into the left ventricle and ventriculogram performed in right anterior oblique position  the mitral valve is competent and demonstrates normal mobility  the left ventricular cavity is normal in size with excellent contractility  aneurysmal dilatation andor dyskinesia absent  the aortic valve is tricuspid and normal mobility  the ascending aorta appeared normalpigtail catheter wa introduced in the mid abdominal aorta and placed just above the renal artery  an abdominal aortic injection wa performed  under fluoroscopy we see heavy dense calcification of the mid abdominal aorta between the renal artery and the

mild intimal irregularity  there is a normal left renal artery normal right renal artery  the celiac seems to be normal but what i believe is the splenic artery seen initially at it origin is normal  the common left iliac and common right iliac artery are essentially normal in this areacoronary anatomy  one note ostial coronary calcification of the right coronary artery  cineangiogram obtained with 6french jr4 and 5french jr4 catheter  prior to the introduction of the 5french jr4 nitroglycerin wa administered sublingually  the 6french jr4 catheter appeared to a show an ostial lesion of over 50  there wa backwash of dye into the aorta although there is a fine funneling of the ostium towards the proximal right coronary artery  in the proximal portion of the right coronary artery just into the shepherd turn there is a 50 smooth tapering of the right coronary artery in the proximal third  then the artery seems to have a little bit more normal size and it divide into a large posterior descending artery posterolateral branch vessel  the distal portion of the vessel is free of disease  the conus branch is seen arising right at the beginning part of the right coronary artery  we then removed the 6french catheter and following nitroglycerin and sublingually we placed a 5french catheter and again finding a stenosis may be le than 50  at the ostium of the right coronary artery calcification again is identified  backwash of dye noted at the proximal lesion looked about the same 50 along the proximal turn of the shepherd turn areathe left coronary artery is normal although there is a rim of ostial calcification but there is no tapering or stenosis  it form the left anterior descending artery the ramus branch and the circumflex arterythe left anterior descending artery is a very large vessel very tortuous in it proximal segment very tortuous in it mid and distal segment  there appears to be some mild stenosis of 10 in the proximal segment  it give off a large diagonal branch in the proximal portion of the left anterior descending artery and it is free of disease  the remaining portion of the left anterior descending artery is free of disease  upon injection of the left coronary artery we see what i believe is the dye enters probably directly into the left ventricle but via fistula excluding the coronary sinus and we get a ventriculogram performed  i could not identify an isolated area but it seems to be from the interventricular septal collateral that this is taking placethe ramus branch is normal and free of diseasethe left

explained to them the two method of testing with csf drainage  it is possible that a large volume lumbar puncture would reveal whether she is likely to respond to shunt and i described that test  about 30 of my patient with walking impairment in a setting of possible adult hydrocephalus can be diagnosed with a large volume lumbar puncture  alternatively i could bring her into the hospital for four day of csf drainage to determine whether she is likely to respond to shunt surgery  this procedure carry a 2 to 3 risk of meningitis  i also explained that it would be reasonable to start with an outpatient lumbar puncture and if that is not sufficient we could proceed with admission for the spinal catheter protocol ,2.0

fourlevel decompression on 082806  the patient continued to complain of posterior neck pain radiating to both trapezius  review of his mri revealed the presence of what still appeared to be residual lateral recess stenosis  it also raised the possibility of instability and based on this i recommended decompression and posterolateral spinal instrumention however intraoperatively it appeared like there wa no abnormal movement of any of the joint segment however there wa still residual stenosis since the laminectomy that wa done previously wa partial  based on this i did total decompression by removing the lamina of c3 through c6 and doing bilateral medial facetectomy and foraminotomy at c3c4 c4c5 c5c6 and c6c7 with no spinal instrumentation  operation and expected outcome risk and benefit were discussed with him prior to the surgery  risk include but not exclusive of bleeding and infection  infection can be superficial but may also extend down to the epidural space which may require return to the operating room and evacuation of the infection  there is also the risk of bleeding that could be superficial but may also be in the epidural space resulting in compression of spinal cord  this may result in weakness of all four extremity numbness of all four extremity and impairment of bowel and bladder function which will require an urgent return to the operating room and evacuation of the hematoma  there is also the risk of a dural tear with it attendant problem of csf leak headache nausea vomiting photophobia pseudomeningocele and dural meningitis  this too may require return to the operating room for evacuation of said pseudomeningocele and repair  the patient understood the risk of the surgery  i told him there is just a 30 chance that there will be no improvement with

appearing cortex and medulla  the thyroid gland weighs 124 gram and is grossly normalextremities  both leg and calf were measured and found to be very similar in circumference  both leg were also milked and produced no clot in the venous systemclinicopathologic correlationthis patient died shortly after a previous pulmonary embolus completely occluded the right pulmonary artery vasculature the most significant finding on autopsy wa the presence of multiple old and new thromboemboli in the pulmonary vasculature of the right lung  the autopsy revealed evidence of multiple embolus in the right lung that were at least a few day old because the embolus that were organizing were adherent to the vessel wall  in order to be adherent to the vessel wall the embolus must be in place long enough to evoke a fibroblast response which take at least a few day  the fatal event wa not the old embolus in the right lung but rather the thrombosis on top of the large saddle thrombus residing in the pulmonary artery  this created a highpressure situation that the right ventricle could not handle resulting in cardiac dysfunction and ultimately the patient demisealthough this case is fairly straight forward in term of what caused the terminal event perhaps the more interesting question is why a relatively healthy 35yearold man would develop a fatal pulmonary embolism  virchow triad suggests we should investigate endothelial injury stasis and a hypercoagulable state a possible etiology  the age of the patient probably precludes venous stasis a the sole reason for the embolus although it could have certainly contributed  the autopsy revealed no evidence of endothelial damage in the pulmonary vasculature that would have caused the occlusion  the next logical reason would be a hypercoagulable state  some possibility include obesity trauma surgery cancer factor v leiden deficiency a well a other inherited disordersprothrombin gene mutation deficiency in protein c protein s or antithrombin iii and disorder of plasminogen and lupus anticoagulant  of these risk factor obesity wa the only risk factor the patient wa known to have  the patient had no evidence of trauma surgery cancer or the stigma of sle therefore these are unlikely  perhaps the most fruitful search would be an examination of the genetic possibility for a hypercoagulable state factor v leiden being the most commonin summary this patient died of a pulmonary embolism the underlying cause of which is currently undetermined  a definitive diagnosis may be ascertained with either genetic or other laboratory test and a more detailed historysummary and reflectionwhat i learned from this autopsy  i learned that although a cause of death may sometimes be obvious the underlying mechanism for the death may still be elusive  this patient wa an otherwise completely healthy 35yearold man with one known risk factor for a hypercoagulable stateremaining unanswered question  basically the cause of the hypercoagulable state is undetermined  once that question is answered i believe this autopsy will have done a great service for the patient family ,2.0

down across the top of her left shoulder and also across her shoulder blade to the right side but predominantly down the left upper extremity into the wrist  the patient ha been diagnosed with fibromyalgia and subsequently ha been treated with pain medication antiinflammatories and muscle relaxant  the patient symptom continued to persist and subsequently an mri of the cspine wa done which showed disc desiccation spondylosis and herniated disk at c5c6 an emg and cv revealed a presence of mildtomoderate carpal tunnel syndrome  the patient is now being recommended to undergo decompression and spinal instrumentation and fusion at c5c6  the patient understood the risk and benefit of the surgery  risk include but not exclusive of bleeding and infection  bleeding can be in the form of soft tissue bleeding which may compromise airway for which she can be brought emergently back to the operating room for emergent evacuation of the hematoma a this may cause weakness of all four extremity numbness of all four extremity a well a impairment of bowel and bladder function  this could also result in dural tear with it attendant symptom of headache nausea vomiting photophobia and posterior neck pain a well a the development of pseudomeningocele  should the symptom be severe or the pseudomeningocele be large she can be brought back to the operating room for repair of the csf leak and evacuation of the pseudomeningocele  there is also the risk of pseudoarthrosis and nonfusion for which she may require redo surgery at this level  there is also the possibility of nonimprovement of her symptom in about 10 of case  the patient understands this risk on top of the potential injury to the esophagus and trachea a well a the carotid artery  there is also the risk of stroke should an

1988,preoperative diagnosis  right renal masspostoperative diagnosis  right renal massprocedure performed  laparoscopic right partial nephrectomyestimated blood loss  250 mlxrays  nonespecimens  included right renal mass a well a biopsy from the base of the resectionanesthesia  general endotrachealcomplications  nonedrains  included a jp drain in the right flank a well a a 16french foley catheter per urethrabrief history  the patient is a 60yearold gentleman with a history of an enhancing right renal mass approximately 2 cm in diameter  i had a long discussion with him concerning variety of option  we talked in particular about extirpated versus ablative surgery  based on his young age and excellent state of health decision wa made at this point to proceed to a right partial nephrectomy laparoscopically  all question were answered and he wished to proceed with surgery a planned  note that the patient doe have a positive family history of renal cell carcinomaprocedure in detail  after acquisition of proper informed consent and administration of perioperative antibiotic the patient wa taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table  after institution of adequate general anesthetic via endotracheal rod he wa placed into the right anterior flank position with his right side elevated on a roll and his right arm across his chest  all pressure point were carefully padded and he wa securely taped to the table  note that sequential compression device were in place on both lower extremity and were activated prior to induction of anesthesia  his abdomen wa then prepped and draped in a standard surgical fashion  note that a 16french foley catheter wa in place per urethra a well a an orogastric tube  the abdomen wa insufflated at the right lateral abdomen using the veress needle to a pressure of 15 without incident  we then placed a visiport 10 x 12 trocar in the right lateral abdomen  with the trocar in place we were able to place the remaining trocars under direct laparoscopic visualization  we placed three additional trocars  an 11 mm screw type trocar at the umbilicus a 6 screw type trocar 7 cm in the midline above the umbilicus and a 10 x 12 trocar to serve a a retractor port approximately 8 cm inferior in the midlinethe procedure wa begun by reflecting the right colon by incising the white line of toldt  the colon wa reflected medially and the retroperitoneum wa exposed on that side  this wa a fairly superficial lesion so decision wa made in advance to potentially not perform vascular clamping however i did feel it important to get high level control prior to proceeding to the partial  with the colon reflected the duodenum wa identified and it wa reflected medially under kocher maneuver  the ureter and gonadal vein were identified on the right side and elevated  the space between the ureter and the gonadal vein wa then developed and the gonadal vein wa dropped elevating only the ureter and carrying this plane dissection up towards the renal hilum  once we got up to the renal hilum we were able to skeletonize the renal hilar vessel partially and in particular we did develop some of the upper pole dissection above the level of the hilum to provide for access for a satinsky clamp or bulldog  the remainder of the kidney wa then freed off it lateral and superior attachment primarily using the harmonic scalpel and the ligasure devicewith the kidney free and the hilum prepared the gerota fascia wa taken down overlying the kidney exposing the renal parenchyma and using this approach we were able to identify the 2cm right renal mass located in the lower pole laterally  a cap of fat wa left overlying this mass  based on the position of the mass we performed intraoperative laparoscopic ultrasound which showed the mass to be somewhat deeper than initially anticipated  based on this finding i decided to go ahead and clamp the renal hilum during resection  a satinsky clamp wa introduced through the lower most trocar site and used to clamp the renal hilum en bloc  note that the patient had been receiving renal protection protocol including fenoldopam and mannitol throughout the procedure and he also received lasix prior to clamping the renal hilum  with the renal hilum clamped we did resect the tumor using cold scissors  there wa somewhat more bleeding than would be expected based on the hilar clamping however we were able to successfully resect this lesion  we also took a biopsy at the base of the resection and passed off the table a a specimen for frozen section  with the tumor resected the base of the resection wa then cauterized using the argon beam coagulator and several bleeding vessel were oversewn using figureofeight 30 vicryl suture with lap tie for tensioning  we then placed a floseal into the wound and covered it with a surgicel and held the pressure  we then released the vascular clamp  total clamp time wa 11 minute  there wa minimal bleeding and occlusion of this maneuver and after unclamping the kidney the kidney pinked up appropriately and appeared well perfused after removal of the clamp  we then replaced the kidney within it gerota envelope and closed that with 30 vicryl using lap tie for tensioning  a jp drain wa introduced through the right flank and placed adjacent to the kidney and sutured the skin with 20 nylon  the specimen wa placed into a 10mm endocatch bag and extracted from the lower most trocar site after extending it approximately 1 cm  it wa evaluated on the table and passed off the table for pathology to evaluate  they stated that the tumor wa close to the margin but there appeared to be 12 mm normal parenchyma around the tumor  in addition the frozen section biopsy from the base of the resection were negative for renal cell carcinoma  based on these finding the lower most trocar site wa closed using a running 0 vicryl suture in the fascia  we then reinsufflated the abdomen and carefully evaluated the entire intraoperative field for hemostasis  any bleeding point were controlled primarily using bipolar cautery or hemoclips  the area wa copiously irrigated with normal saline  the colon wa then replaced into it normal anatomic position  the mesentry wa evaluated  there were no defect noted  we closed the 10 x 12 lateral most trocar site using a carterthompson closure device with 0vicryl  all trocars were removed under direct visualization and the abdomen wa desufflated prior to removal of the last trocar  the skin incision were irrigated with normal saline and infiltrated with 025 marcaine and the skin wa closed using a running 40 monocryl in subcuticular fashion  benzoin and steristrips were placed  the patient wa returned in supine position and awoken from general anesthetic without incident  he wa then transferred to hospital gurney and taken to the postanesthesia care unit for postoperative monitoring  at the end of the case sponge instrument and needle count were correct  i wa scrubbed and present throughout the entire case ,2.0

crossing renal artery  up on consideration of various modality and therapy the patient decided to undergo surgical therapyprocedure in detail  the patient wa verified by armband and the procedure being roboticassisted right pyeloplasty with nephrolithotomy wa verified and the procedure wa carried out  after institution of general endotracheal anesthesia and intravenous preoperative antibiotic the patient wa positioned into the right flank position with his right flank elevated  great care wa taken to pad all pressure point and a right arm hanger wa used  the patient wa flexed slightly and a kidney rest wa used  sequential compression device were also placed  next the patient wa prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion with povidoneiodine  pneumoperitoneum wa obtained by placing a veress needle in the area of the umbilicus after it passed the water test  a low pressure high flow pneumoperitoneum wa adequately obtained using co2 gas  next a 12mm camera port wa placed near the umbilicus  the camera wa inserted and no bowel injury wa seen  next under direct vision flanking 8 mm camera port a 12 mm assist port a 5 mm liver retraction port and 5 mm assist port were placed  the robot wa docked and the instrument passed through respective check  initial attention wa directed to mobilizing the right colon from the abdominal wall totally medially  next the right lateral duodenum wa cauterized for further access to the right retroperitoneum  at this point the right kidney wa in clear view and the fascia wa entered  initial attention wa directed at careful dissection of the renal pelvis and proximal ureter which wa done with a combination of electrocautery and blunt dissection  it became readily apparent that there were two crossing vessel one in the medial inferior region of the kidney and another one in the most inferior portion of the lower pole  these artery were dissected carefully and vessel loop were applied  next a small hole wa then made in the renal pelvis using electrocautery and the content of the renal pelvis were suctioned out  the pyelotomy wa extended so that the renal collecting system could be directly inspected  sequentially each major calyx wa inspected under direct vision and irrigated  a total of four round kidney stone were extracted to be sent for analysis to being satisfied for the patient  at this point we directed our attention at the proximal right ureter which wa dismembered from the remaining renal pelvis  the proximal ureter wa spatulated using cold scissors  next redundant renal pelvis wa excised using cold scissors and sent for permanent section  we then identified the most inferiordependent portion of the renal pelvis and placed a heel stitch at this for ureteralrenal pelvis anastomosis in a semi running fashion  30 monocryl suture were used to reanastomose the newly spatulated right ureter to the inferior portion of the renal pelvis  next remainder of the pyelotomy wa closed to itself also using 20 monocryl suture  before final stitch were placed a 6x28 ureteral stent wa placed anterograde  this wa accomplished by placing the stent over a guidewire placing the guidewire under direct vision anterograde through the ureter  this wa done until the proximal end wa in the renal pelvis the guidewire wa removed and good proximal curl wa verified by direct vision  then the pyelotomy wa completely closed again with 20 monocryl suture  next attention wa directed at transposition of the crossing renal artery by fixing it with vicryl suture that would impinge le upon the renal pelvis  good pulsation wa verified by direct vision proximal and distal to these pexy suture  next gerotas fascia wa reapproximated and closed with vicryl suture a wa the right peritoneum  hemostasis appeared excellent at this point  there wa no obvious urine extravasation  at this time the procedure wa terminated  the robot wa undocked  under direct visualization all 8 and 12 mm port were closed at the level of the fascia with 0 vicryl suture in an interrupted fashion  then all skin port site were closed with 40 monocryl in a subcuticular fashion and dermabond and bandaids were applied over this  also notably a jacksonpratt drain wa placed in the area of the right kidney and additional right flank stab incision  the patient tolerated the procedure well and no immediate perioperative complication wa noteddisposition  the patient wa discharged to post anesthesia care unit and subsequently to genitourinary floor to begin his recovery ,2.0

postradical prostatectomy and postradiation therapy to the pelvis indiana pouch continent cutaneous diversion and omental pedicle flap to the pelvisanesthesia  general endotracheal with epiduralindications  this patient is a 65yearold white male who in 1998 had a radical prostatectomy  he wa initially dry without pad and then underwent salvage radiation therapy for rising psa  after that he began with episode of incontinence a well a urinary retention requiring catheterization  one year ago he wa unable to catheterize and wa taken to the operative room and had cystoscopy  he had retained staple removed and a diverticulum identified  there were also bladder stone that were lasered and removed and he had been incontinent ever since that time  he wear 8 to 10 pad per day and this ha affected his quality of life significantly  i took him to the operating room on january 16 2008 and found diffuse radiation change with a small capacity bladder and wideopen bladder neck  we both felt that his lower urinary tract wa not rehabilitatable and that a continent cutaneous diversion would solve the number of problem facing him  i felt like if we could remove the bladder safely then this would also provide a benefitfindings  at exploration there were no gross lesion of the smaller or large bowel  the bladder wa predictably sucked into the pelvic sidewall both inferiorly and laterally  the opened bladder which we were able to remove completely had a wideopen capacious diverticulum in it very distal segment  because of the previous radiation therapy and a dissection down to the pelvis i elected to place an omental pedicle flap to provide additional blood supply for healing a well in the pelvis and also under the pubic bone which wa exposed inferiorly due to previous surgery and treatmentprocedure in detail  the patient wa brought to the operative suite and after adequate general endotracheal and epidural anesthesia obtained placed in the supine position flexed over the anterosuperior iliac spine and his abdomen and genitalia were sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion  a nasogastric tube wa placed a well a radial arterial line  he wa given intravenous antibiotic for prophylaxis  a generous midline skin incision wa made from the midepigastrium down to the symphysis pubis deep into the rectus fascia the rectus muscle separated in the midline and exploration carried out with the finding described  moist wound towel and a bookwalter retractor were placed for exposure  we began by retracting the bowel by mobilizing the cecum and ascending colon and hepatic flexure and elevating the terminal ileum up to the second and third portion of the duodenum  the ureter wa identified a a crisis over the iliac vessel and dissected deep into pelvis and subsequently divided between clip  an identical procedure wa performed in the left side with similar finding and the bowel were packed cephaladwe began then dissecting the bladder away from the pelvic side wall staying medial to both epigastric artery  this wa quite challenging because of the previous radiation therapy and radical prostatectomy  we essentially carved the bladder off of the pelvic sidewall inferiorly a best we could and then we were able to have enough freedom to identify the lateral pedicle and these were taken between double clip approximately and clipped distally  we then approached thing posteriorly and carefully dissected between the  and posterior bladder  there wa some remnant seminal vesicle on the right a well a both remnant ejaculatory duct and we used this to dissect the longus safe plane anterior to the rectum  we then entered the bladder anteriorly a distal a we could and remove the bladder and what we thought wa a bladder neck and this appeared to end in a diverticulum  we then peeled it off the remaining rectum and passed the specimen off the operative field  bladder wa irrigated with warm sterile water and a meticulous inspection wa made for hemostasiswe then completely mobilized the omentum off of the proximal transverse colon  this allowed a generous flap to be able to be laid into the pelvis without tensionwe then turned our attention to forming the indiana pouch  i completed the dissection of the right hepatic flexure and the proximal transverse colon and mobilized the omentum off of this portion of the colon  the colon wa divided proximal to the middle colic using a gia80 stapler  i then divided the avascular plane of treves along the terminal ileum and selected a point approximately 15 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve to divide the ileum  the mesentery wa then sealed with a ligasure device and divided and the bowel wa divided with a gia60 stapler  we then performed a sidetoside ileotransverse colostomy using a gia80 stapler closing the open end with a ta 60  the angle were reinforced with silk suture and the mesenteric closed with interrupted silk sutureswe then removed the staple line along the terminal ileum passed a 12french robinson catheter into the cecal segment and plicated the ileum with 3 firing of the gia60 stapler  the ileocecal valve wa then reinforced with interrupted 30 silk suture a described by rowland et al and following this passage of an 18french robinson catheter wa associated with the characteristic pop indicating that we had adequately plicated the ileocecal valveas the patient had had a previous appendectomy we made an opening in the cecum in the area of the previous appendectomy  we then removed the distal staple line along the transverse colon and aligned the cecal end and the distal middle colic end with two 30 vicryl suture  the bowel segment wa then folded over on itself and the reservoir formed with 3 successive application of the sgia polysorb75  between the staple line vicryl suture were placed and the defect closed with 30 vicryl suture ligatureswe then turned our attention to forming the ileocolonic anastomosis  the left ureter wa mobilized and brought underneath the sigmoid mesentery and brought through the mesentery of the terminal ileum and an endtoside anastomosis performed with an open technique using interrupted 40 vicryl suture and this wa stented with a cook 84french ureteral stent and this wa secured to the bowel lumen with a 50 chromic suture  the right ureter wa brought underneath the pouch and placed in a stented fashion with an identical anastomosis  we then brought the stent out through a separate incision cephalad in the pouch and they were secured with a 20 chromic suture  a 24french malecot catheter wa placed through the cecum and secured with a chromic suture  the staple line were then buried with a running 30 vicryl twolayer suture and the open end of the pouch closed with a ta 60 polysorb suture  the pouch wa filled to 240 cc and noted to be watertight and the ureteral anastomosis were intactwe then made a final inspection for hemostasis  the cecostomy tube wa then brought out to the right lower quadrant and secured to the skin with silk suture  we then matured our stoma through the umbilicus  we removed the plug of skin through the umbilicus and delivered the ileal segment through this  a portion of the ileum wa removed and healthy wellvascularized tissue wa matured with interrupted 30 chromic suture  we left an 18french robinson through the stomag and secured this to the skin with silk suture  the malecot and stent were also secured in a similar fashionwe matured the stoma to the umbilicus with interrupted chromic stitch  the stitch wa brought out to the right upper quadrant and the malecot to the left lower quadrant  a large jp drain wa placed in the pelvis dependent to the omentum pedicle flap a well a the indiana pouchthe rectus fascia wa closed with a buried 2 prolene running stitch tying a new figureofeight proximally and distally and meeting in the middle and tying it underneath the fascia  subcutaneous tissue wa irrigated with saline and skin wa closed with surgical clip  the estimated blood loss wa 450 ml and the patient received no packed red blood cell  the final sponge and needle count were reported to be correct  the patient wa awakened

grafttechnique  the patient wa brought to the operating room  preoperative evaluation included previous cervical spine surgery  the patient initially had some relief however his left arm pain did recur and gradually got worse  repeat study including myelogram and postspinal ct revealed some blunting of the nerve root at c4c5 and c5c6  there wa also noted to be some annular bulge at c3c4 and c6c7  the ct scan in march revealed that the fusion wa not fully solid  xrays were done in november including flexion and extension view it appeared that the fusion wa solidthe patient had been on pain medication  the patient had undergone several nonoperative treatment  he wa given the option of surgical intervention  we discussed botox i discussed with the patient and posterior cervical decompression  i explained to the patient this will leave a larger scar on his neck and that no guarantee would help there would be more bleeding and more pain from the posterior surgery than it wa from the anterior surgery  if at the time of surgery there wa some motion of the c4c5 level i would recommend a fusion  the patient wa a smoker and had been advised to quit smoking but ha not quit smoking  i have therefore recommended that he use iliac bone graft  i explained to the patient that this would give him a scar over the back of the right pelvis and could be a source of chronic pain for the patient for the rest of his life  even if this type of bone graft wa used there wa no guarantee that it will fuse and he should stop smoking completelythe patient also wa advised that if i did a fusion i would also use post instrumentation which wa a wire  the wire would be left permanentlyeven with all these procedure there wa no guarantee that his symptom would improve  his numbness tingling and weakness could get worse rather than better his neck pain and arm pain could persist  he still had some residual bursitis in his left shoulder and this would not be cured by this procedure  other procedure may be necessary later  there is still with a danger of becoming quadriplegic or losing total control of bowel or bladder function  he could lose total control of his arm or leg and end up in the bed for the rest of his life  he could develop chronic regional pain syndrome  he could get difficulty swallowing or eating  he could have substantial weakness in the arm  he wa advised that he should not undergo the surgery unless the pain is persistent severe and unremittinghe wa also offered his record if he would like any other pain medication or seek other treatment he wa advised that dr x would continue to prescribe pain medication if he did not wish to proceed with surgeryhe stated he understood all the risk  he did not wish to get any other treatment  he said the pain ha reached the point that he wished to proceed with surgeryprocedure in detail  in the operating room he wa given general endotracheal anesthesiai then carefully rolled the patient on thoracic roll  his head wa controlled by a horseshoe holder  the anesthesiologist checked the eye position to make sure there wa no pressure on the orbit and the anesthesiologist continued to check them every 15 minute  the arm the right hip and the neck wa then prepped and draped  care wa taken to position both arm and both leg  pulse were checkeda midline incision wa made through the skin and subcutaneous tissue on the cervical spine  a loupe magnification and headlamp illumination wa used  bleeding vessel were cauterized  meticulous hemostasis wa carried out throughout the procedure  gradually and carefully i exposed the spinous process of the c6 c5 and c4  a lateral view wa done after an instrument in place  this revealed the c6c7 level  i therefore did a small laminotomy opening at c4c5  i placed an instrument and xrays confirmed c4c5 leveli stripped the muscle from the lamina and then moved them laterally and held with a selfretaining retractoronce i identified the level i then used a bur to thin the lamina of c5  i used a 1mm followed by a 2mm kerrison rongeur to carefully remove the lamina off c5 on the left  i removed some of the superior lamina of c6 and some of the inferior lamina of c4  this allowed me to visualize the dura and the nerve root and gradually do neural foraminotomies for both the c5 and c6 nerve root  there wa some bleeding from the epidural vein and a bipolar cautery wa used  absolutely no retractor were ever placed in the canal  there wa no retraction  i wa able to place a small probe underneath the nerve root and check the disc space to make sure there wa no fragment of disc or herniation disc and none were foundat the end of the procedure the neuroforamen were widely patent  the nerve root had been fully decompressedi then checked stability  there wa micromotion at the c4c5 level  i therefore elected to proceed with a fusioni debrided the interspinous ligament between c4 and c5  i used a bur to roughen up the surface of the superior portion of the spinous process of c5 and the inferior portion of c4  using a small drill i opened the facet at c4c5  i then used a very small curette to clean up the articular cartilage  i used a bur then to roughen up the lamina at c4c5attention wa turned to the right and left hip which wa also prepped  an incision made over the iliac crest  bleeding vessel were cauterized  i exposed just the posterior aspect of the crest  i removed some of the bone and then used the curette to remove cancellous bonei placed the songer wire through the base of the spinous process of c4 and c5  drill hole made with a clip  i then packed cancellous bone between the decorticated spinous process  i then tightened the songer wire to the appropriate tension and then cut off the excess wireprior to tightening the wire i also packed cancellous bone with facet at c4c5  i then laid bone upon the decorticated lamina of c4 and c5the hip wound wa irrigated with bacitracin and kantrex  deep

the patient wa positioned into the right flank position with his right flank elevated  great care wa taken to pad all pressure point and a right arm hanger wa used  the patient wa flexed slightly and a kidney rest wa used  sequential compression device were also placed  next the patient wa prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion with povidoneiodine  pneumoperitoneum wa obtained by placing a veress needle in the area of the umbilicus after it passed the water test  a low pressure high flow pneumoperitoneum wa adequately obtained using co2 gas  next a 12mm camera port wa placed near the umbilicus  the camera wa inserted and no bowel injury wa seen  next under direct vision flanking 8 mm camera port a 12 mm assist port a 5 mm liver retraction port and 5 mm assist port were placed  the robot wa docked and the instrument passed through respective check  initial attention wa directed to mobilizing the right colon from the abdominal wall totally medially  next the right lateral duodenum wa cauterized for further access to the right retroperitoneum  at this point the right kidney wa in clear view and the fascia wa entered  initial attention wa directed at careful dissection of the renal pelvis and proximal ureter which wa done with a combination of electrocautery and blunt dissection  it became readily apparent that there were two crossing vessel one in the medial inferior region of the kidney and another one in the most inferior portion of the lower pole  these artery were dissected carefully and vessel loop were applied  next a small hole wa then made in the renal pelvis using electrocautery and the content of the renal pelvis were suctioned out  the pyelotomy wa extended so that the renal collecting system could be directly inspected  sequentially each major calyx wa inspected under direct vision and irrigated  a total of four round kidney stone were extracted to be sent for analysis to being satisfied for the patient  at this point we directed our attention at the proximal right ureter which wa dismembered from the remaining renal pelvis  the proximal ureter wa spatulated using cold scissors  next redundant renal pelvis wa excised using cold scissors and sent for permanent section  we then identified the most inferiordependent portion of the renal pelvis and placed a heel stitch at this for ureteralrenal pelvis anastomosis in a semi running fashion  30 monocryl suture were used to reanastomose the newly spatulated right ureter to the inferior portion of the renal pelvis  next remainder of the pyelotomy wa closed to itself also using 20 monocryl suture  before final stitch were placed a 6x28 ureteral stent wa placed anterograde  this wa accomplished by placing the stent over a guidewire placing the guidewire under direct vision anterograde through the ureter  this wa done until the proximal end wa in the renal pelvis the guidewire wa removed and good proximal curl wa verified by direct vision  then the pyelotomy wa completely closed again with 20 monocryl suture  next attention wa directed at transposition of the crossing renal artery by fixing it with vicryl suture that would impinge le upon the renal pelvis  good pulsation wa verified by direct vision proximal and distal to these pexy suture  next gerotas fascia wa reapproximated and closed with vicryl suture a wa the right peritoneum  hemostasis appeared excellent at this point  there wa no obvious urine extravasation  at this time the procedure wa terminated  the robot wa undocked  under direct visualization all 8 and 12 mm port were closed at the level of the fascia with 0 vicryl suture in an interrupted fashion  then all skin port site were closed with 40 monocryl in a subcuticular fashion and dermabond and bandaids were applied over this

for being cured without adjuvant therapy  i would consider her borderline for chemotherapy given her young age  referring to the database that had been online she ha a 13 chance of relapse in the next

smaller benefit of around 25plan wa made to allow her to recuperate and then meet with her and her husband to discus the pro and con of adjuvant chemotherapy including what regimen she could consider including the side effect  we did not review all that information todayshe ha a family history of early colon cancer  her mother will be visiting in the weekend and plan is to obtain the rest of the

compress the spinal cord and result in weakness and numbness of all four extremity a well a impairment of bowel and bladder function  should this occur the patient understands that she need to be brought emergently back to the operating room for evacuation of said hematoma  there is also the risk of infection which can be superficial and can be managed with po antibiotic  however the patient may develop deeperseated infection which may require return to the operating room  should the infection be in the area of the spinal instrumentation this will cause a dilemma since there might be a need to remove the spinal instrumentation andor allograft  there is also the possibility of potential injury to the esophageus the trachea and the carotid artery  there is also the risk of stroke on the right cerebral circulation should an undiagnosed plaque be propelled from the right carotid  there is also the possibility hoarseness of the voice secondary to injury to the recurrent laryngeal

3122,history of present illness  i wa kindly asked to see m abc who is a 74yearold woman for cardiology consultation regarding atrial fibrillation and anticoagulation after a fallthe patient is somnolent at this time but doe arouse but is unable to provide much history  by review of the chart it appears that she fell which is what she state when she got up out of a rocking chair and could not get herself off the floor  she state that 112 hour later she wa able to get herself off the floorthe patient denies any chest pain nor clear shortness of breathpast medical history  includes endstage renal disease from hypertension  she follows up with dr x in her office and ha been known to have a smalltomoderate sized pericardial effusion since 1107 that ha apparently been followed and it appears that the patient wa not interested in having diagnostic pericardiocentesis done  she had an echocardiogram today please see also that report which show stable and smalltomoderate sized pericardial effusion without tamponade normal left ventricular ejection fraction at 55 with mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy mildly dilated right ventricular size normal right ventricular ejection fraction moderate mitral regurgitation and severe tricuspid regurgitation with severe pulmonary hypertension estimated pa systolic pressure of 71 mmhg when compared to the prior echocardiogram done 082907 previously the mitral regurgitation wa mild and previously the pa systolic pressure wa estimated at 90 mmhg  other finding were not significantly changed including

when compared to one done on 070609 at 1825 there is really no significant change  the atrial fibrillation appears present since at least on ekg done on 110207 and this ekg is not significantly

ha a history of vascular dementia so her history is somewhat unreliable it seems and she is somnolent at that time  she doe have chronic atrial fibrillation again documented at least present since 2007 and i found an ekg report by dr x which show atrial fibrillation on 082907 per her report  one of the question we were asked wa whether the patient would be a candidate for coumadin  clearly given her history of small ministrokes i think coumadin would be appropriate given this chronic atrial fibrillation but the main issue is the fall risk  if not felt to be significant fall risk then i would strongly recommend coumadin a the patient herself state that she ha only fallen twice in the past year  i would defer that decision to dr z and dr xy who know the patient well and it may be that physical therapy consult is appropriate to help adjudicaterecommendations1  fall assessment a per dr z and dr xy with possible pt consult if felt appropriate and if the patient is not felt to be at significant fall risk would put her on coumadin  given her history of small stroke a documented in the chart and her chronic atrial fibrillation she doe have reasonable heart rate control on current labetalol2  the patient ha elevated bnp and i suspect that is due to her severe pulmonary hypertension and renal failure and in the light of normal lv function i would not make any further evaluation of that other than aggressive diuresis3  regarding this minimal troponin elevation i do not feel this is a diagnosis especially in the setting of pulmonary hypertension and her smalltomoderate sized stable pericardial effusion again that ha been longstanding since 2007 from what i can tell and there is no evidence of tamponade  i would defer to her usual cardiologist dr x whether an outpatient stress evaluation is appropriate for risk stratification  i did find that the patient had a prior cardiac stress test in 0807 where they felt that there wa some subtle reversibility of the anterior wall but it wa felt that it may be artifact rather than true ischemia with normal lv function seen on that study a well4  continue norvasc for history of hypertension a well a labetalol5  the patient is felt to be a significant fall risk and will at least continue her aspirin 81 mg once a day for secondary cva thromboprophylaxis albeit understanding that it is inferior to coumadin6  continue dilantin for history of seizure ,1.0

2910,history of present illness the patient is known to me secondary to atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response partially due to medication at least when i first saw him in the office on 011106 he is now 77 year old he is being seen on the seventh floor the patient is in room 7607 the patient ha a history of recent adenocarcinoma of the duodenum that wa found to be inoperable since it engulfed the porta hepatis the workup began with gi bleeding he wa seen in my office on 011106 for preop evaluation due to leg edema a nonocclusive dvt wa diagnosed in the proximal left superficial femoral vein both leg were edematous and bilateral venous insufficiency wa also present an echocardiogram demonstrated an ejection fraction of 50 the patient wa admitted to the hospital and treated with a greenfield filter since anticoagulant wa contraindicated additional information on the echocardiogram where a grossly dilated left atrium moderately severely dilated right atrium the rhythm wa a stated before atrial fibrillation with slow atrioventricular conduction and an intraventricular conduction delay on the monitor strip there wa mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation mild pulmonic insufficiency the ejection fraction wa considered low normal since it wa estimated 50 to 54 the patient received blood while in the hospital due to anemia the leg edema improved while lying down suggesting that the significant element of venous insufficiency wa indeed present the patient who wa diabetic received consultation by dr r he wa also a chronic hypertensive and wa treated for that with ace inhibitor the atrial fibrillation wa slow and no digitalis or beta blocker were recommended at the same time a a matter of fact they were discontinued now the patient denied any shortness of breath or chest pain throughout this hospitalization and cardiac nuclear study performed earlier demonstrated no reversible ischemiaallergies the patient ha no known drug allergieshis diabetes wa

scenario whereby he will become a candidate for management of this arrhythmia beyond weight control he is also not a candidate for anticoagulation which is in essence a part and parcel of the weight control reason being is high likelihood for gi bleeding especially given the diagnosis of invasive malignancy with involvement of multiple organ and lymph node at this point i agree with the notion of hospice care if his atrioventricular conduction becomes excessive occasional nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker such a diltiazem or beta blocker would be appropriate otherwise i would keep him off those medication due to evidence of slow conduction in the presence of digitalis and beta blocker ,1.0

inspiratory flow limitation compatible with snoring wa observed during nonrem sleepassessment and plan  this patient present with history of sleep disruption and daytime sleepiness with fatigue  her symptom are multifactorialregarding the etiology of difficulty in initiating and maintaining sleep the patient ha a component of psychophysiologic insomnia based on report of better sleep in the laboratory a compared to home  in addition nontrivial smoking in the home setting may be contributing significantly to sleep disruptionregarding her daytime sleepiness the patient is taking a number of longacting central nervous system acting medication to sedate her and can produce a lasting sedation throughout the daytime  these include trazodone seroquel and methadone  of these medication the methadone is clearly indicative given the history of substance abuse  it would be desirable to reduce or discontinue trazodone and then perhaps consider doing the same with seroquel  i brought this possibility up with the patient and i asked her to discus this further with her psychiatristfinally to help mitigate sleep disruption at night i have provided her with tip for sleep hygiene  these include bedtime ritual stimulus control therapy and sleep restriction a well a avoidance of nicotine in the evening hour ,1.0

ambulate in a wheelchair  metastatic workup doe reveal multiple bone metastasis but no spinal cord compression  she had a consult with radiationoncology that decided they could radiate her metastasis le than 3 cm with stereotactic radiosurgery but the lesion greater than 3 cm needed to be removed  consequently this operation is performedprocedure in detail  the patient underwent a planning mri scan with stealth protocol  she wa brought to the operating room with fiducial still on her scalp  general endotracheal anesthesia wa obtained  she wa placed on the mayfield head holder and rolled into the prone position  she wa well padded secured and so forth  the neck wa flexed so a to expose the right suboccipital region a well a the left and right parietooccipital region  the posterior aspect of the calvarium wa shaved and prepared in the usual manner with betadine soak scrub followed by betadine paint  this wa done only of course after fiducial were registered in planning and an excellent accuracy wa obtained with the stealth system  sterile drape were applied and the accuracy of the system wa confirmed  a biparietal incision wa performed  a linear incision wa chosen so a to increase her chance of successful wound healing and that she is status post whole brain radiation  a biparietal craniotomy wa carried out carrying about 1 cm over toward the right side and about 4 cm over to the left side a guided by the stealth stereotactic system  the dura wa opened and reflected back to the midline  an inner hemispheric approach wa used to reach the very large metastatic tumor  this wa very delicate removing the tumor and the cosurgeons switched off to spare one another during the more delicate part of the operation to remove the tumor  the tumor wa wrapped around and included the choroidal vessel  at least one choroidal vessel wa sacrificed in order to obtain a gross total excision of the tumor on the parietal occipital region  bleeding wa quite vigorous in some of the artery and finally however wa completely controlled  complete removal of the tumor wa confirmed by intraoperative ultrasoundonce the tumor had been removed and meticulous hemostasis wa obtained this wound wa left opened and attention wa turned to the right suboccipital area  a linear incision wa made just lateral to the greater occipital nerve  sharp dissection wa carried down in the subcutaneous tissue and bovie electrocautery wa used to reach the skull  a burr hole wa placed down low using a craniotome  a craniotomy wa turned and then enlarged a a craniectomy to at least 4 cm in diameter  it wa carried caudally to the floor of the posterior fossa and rostrally to the transverse sinus  stealth and ultrasound were used to localize the very large tumor that wa within the horizontal hemisphere of the cerebellum  the ventriculostomy had been placed on the left side with the craniotomy and removal of the tumor and this wa draining csf relieving pressure in the posterior fossa  upon opening the craniotomy in the parietal occipital region the brain wa noted to be extremely tight thus necessitating placement of the ventriculostomyat the posterior fossa a corticectomy wa accomplished and the tumor wa countered directly  the tumor a the one above wa removed both piecemeal and with intraoperative cavitron ultrasonic aspirator  a gross total excision of this tumor wa obtained a welli then explored underneath the cerebellum in hope of finding another metastasis in the cp angle however this wa just over the lower cranial nerve and rather than risk paralysis of pharyngeal muscle and voice a well a possibly hearing loss this lesion wa left alone and to be radiated and that it is le than 3 cm in diametermeticulous hemostasis wa obtained for this wound a wellthe posterior fossa wound wa then closed in layer  the dura wa closed with interrupted and running mattress of 40 nurolon  the dura wa watertight and it wa covered with blue glue  gelfoam wa

history  this is a 45yearold caucasian gentleman presented to abcd general hospital with acute onset of right lower quadrant pain that began 24 hour prior to this evaluationthe pain wa very vague and progressed in intensity  the patient ha had anorexia with decrease in appetite  his physical examination revealed the patient to be febrile with the temperature of 1024  he had right lower quadrant and suprapubic tenderness with palpation with rovsing sign and rebound consistent with acute surgical abdomen  the patient wa presumed acute appendicitis and wa placed on iv antibiotic and recommended that he undergo diagnostic laparoscopy with possible open exploratory laparotomy  he wa explained the risk benefit and complication of the procedure and gave informed consent to proceedoperative finding  diagnostic laparoscopy revealed purulent drainage within the region of the right lower quadrant adjacent to the cecum and terminal ileum  there wa large amount of purulent drainage  the appendix wa visualized however it wa difficult to be visualized secondary to the acute inflammatory process purulent drainage and edema  it wa decided given the sign of perforation and purulent drainage within the abdomen that we would convert to an open exploratory laparotomy  upon exploration of the ileum there wa noted to be a ruptured meckels diverticulum this wa resected  additionally the appendix appeared normal without evidence of perforation andor edema and a decision to proceed with incidental appendectomy wa performed  the patient wa irrigated with copious amount of warmth

anesthesia wa obtained the abdomen wa prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion with betadine solution  utilizing a 10 blade scalpel an infraumbilical incision wa created  the veress needle wa inserted into the abdomen  the abdomen wa insufflated to approximately 15 mmhg  a 10 mm ablated trocar wa inserted into the abdomen and a video laparoscope wa inserted and the abdomen wa explored and the above finding were noted  a right upper quadrant 5 mm port wa inserted to help with manipulation of bowel and to visualize the appendix  decision wa then made to convert to exploratory laparotomy given the sign of acute perforation  the instrument were then removed  the abdomen wa then deflated  utilizing  10 blade scalpel a midline incision wa created from the xiphoid down to level of the pubic symphysisthe incision wa carried down with a 10 blade scalpel and the bleeding wa controlled along the way with electrocautery  the posterior layer of the rectus fascia and peritoneum wa opened carefully with the scissors a the peritoneum had already been penetrated during laparoscopy  incision wa carried down to the midline within the linea alba  once the abdomen wa opened there wa noted to be gross purulent drainage  the ileum wa explored and there wa noted to be a perforated meckels diverticulum  decision to resect the diverticulum wa performedthe blood supply to the meckels diverticulum wa carefully dissected free and a 30 vicryl wa used to tie off the blood supply to the meckels diverticulum  clamp were placed to the proximal supply to the meckels diverticulum wa tied off with 30 vicryl suture  the meckels diverticulum wa noted to be completely free and wa grasped anteriorly and utilizing a gia stapling device the diverticulum wa transected  there wa noted to be a hemostatic region within the transection and staple line looked intact without evidence of perforation andor leakage  next decision wa decided to go ahead and perform an appendectomy  mesoappendix wa doubly clamped with hemostat and cut with metzenbaum scissors  the appendiceal artery wa identified and wa clamped between two hemostat and transected a well  once the appendix wa completely freed of the surrounding inflammation and adhesion  a plain gut wa placed at the base of the appendix and tied down  the appendix wa milked distally with a straight stat and clamped approximately halfway  a second piece of plain gut suture wa used to ligate above and then wa transected with a 10 blade scalpel  the appendiceal stump wa then inverted with a pursestring suture of 20 vicryl suture  once the  wa completed decision to place a jp drain within the right lower quadrant wa performed  the drain wa positioned within the right lower quadrant and anterior to the rectum and brought out through a separate site in the anterior abdominal wall  it wa sewn in place with a 30 nylon suture  the abdomen wa then irrigated with copious amount of warmed normal saline  the remainder of the abdomen wa unremarkable for pathology  the omentum wa replaced over the bowel content and utilizing 10 pd suture the abdominal wall anterior and posterior rectus fascia were closed with a running suture  once the abdomen wa completely closed the subcutaneous tissue wa irrigated with copious amount of saline and the incision wa closed with staple  the previous laparoscopic site were also closed with staple

the patient wa treated for the abscess in beaumont and then subsequently transferred to some other type of facility near her home in warren michigan at which point she developed a second what wa termed minor myocardial infarctionthe patient subsequently recovered in a cardiac rehab facility and approximately two week later brings u to the month of august at which time she wa at home ambulating with a walker or a cane and then sustained a fall and at that point she wa unable to walk and had acute progressive weakness and wa identified a having a central cord syndrome based on an

 she then underwent a general anesthesia with endotracheal tube also without any difficulty  she wa then examined under anesthesia with noted finding a above  the patient wa then placed in dorsal supine position and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion  a vertical skin incision wa made 1 cm below the umbilicus extending down to 2 cm above the pubic symphysis  this wa made with a first knife and then carried down to the underlying layer of the fascia with the second knife  fascia wa excised in the midline and extended superiorly and inferiorly with the mayo scissors  the rectus muscle wa then separated in the midline  the peritoneum identified and entered bluntly  the peritoneal incision wa then extended superiorly and inferiorly with external visualization of the bladder  the uterus wa markedly evident upon entering the peritoneal cavity  the uterus wa then exteriorized and noted to have the finding a above  at this point approximately 10 cc of vasopressin 20 unit and 30 cc wa injected into the uterine fundus and multiple fibroid were removed by using the incision with the bovie and then using a blunt and the sharp dissection and grasping with lahey clamp  once the debulking of the uterus wa felt appropriate to proceed with the hysterectomy the uterus wa then reapproximated with a few 0 vicryl suture in a figureofeight fashion  the round ligament were identified bilaterally and clamped with the hemostat and transacted with the metzenbaum scissors  the round ligament were then bilaterally tied with the 0 tie and noted to be hemostatic  the uterovarian vessel bilaterally were then isolated through a vascular window created from taking down the round ligament  the uterovarian vessel bilaterally were 0 tied and then doubly clamped with straight ochsner clamp and transacted and suture tied with a heaney hand stitch fashion and both uterine and ovarian vessel were noted to be hemostatic  at this time the attention wa then turned to the vesicouterine peritoneum which wa tented up with allis clamp and the bladder flap wa then created sharply with russian pickup and the metzenbaum scissors  then the bladder wa bluntly dissected off the underlying cervix with a moist raytec sponge down to the level of the cervixat this point the uterus wa pulled on traction and the uterosacral ligament were easily visualized  using 20 pd suture the suture wa placed through both uterosacral ligament distally with a backhand stitch fashion throwing the suture from lateral to medial  these suture were then tagged and saved for later  the

into the left femoral artery and advanced retrograde to the descending aorta ascending aorta and left ventricle  a descending aortogram demonstrated discrete coarctation of the aorta approximately 8 mm distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery  the transverse arch measured 5 mm  isthmus measured 47 mm and coarctation measured 29 x 18 mm at the descending aorta level  the diaphragm measured 56 mm  the pigtail catheter wa exchanged for a wedge catheter which wa then directed into the right innominate artery  this catheter wa exchanged over a wire for a tyshak mini 6 x 2 cm balloon catheter which wa advanced across the coarctation and inflated with complete disappearance of discrete waist  pressure pullback following angioplasty however demonstrated a residual of 1520 mmhg gradient  repeat angiogram showed mild improvement in degree of aortic narrowing  the angioplasty wa then performed using a tyshak mini 7 x 2 cm balloon catheter with complete disappearance of

1958,reason for visit  the patient is an 84yearold man who return for revaluation of possible idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus  he is accompanied by his wife and daughterhistory of present illness  i first saw him nearly a year ago on december 20 2007  at that time he had had a traumatic deterioration over the course of approximately eight month  this included severe cognitive impairment gait impairment and incontinence  he had actually been evaluated at hospital with csf drainage via a temporary spinal catheter but there wa no response that wa noted  when i saw him there were finding consistent with cervical stenosis and i ordered an mri scan of the cervical spine  i subsequently referred him to dr x who performed a cervical laminectomy and instrumented fusion on july 16 2008  according to his note this went wellaccording to the family there ha not been any improvementwith regard to the gait and balance they actually think that he is worse now than he wa a year ago  he is virtually unable to walk at all  he need both a walker and support from an assistant to be able to stand or walk  therefore he is always in the wheelchairhe is completely incontinent  he never indicates his need to the go to the bathroom  on the other hand when asked he will indicate that he need to go  he wear a depends undergarment all the timehe ha no headacheshis thinking and memory are worse  for the most part he is apathetic  he doe not talk very much  he life in a skilled nursing facility in the alzheimers section  he doe have some daytime activity  he take a nap once a day  he doe not read very much  on the other hand he did recently exercise the right to vote in the presidential election  he need full assistance at the nursing homemedications  from the list by the nursing

minimental state exam score wa 1430  he wa not at all oriented  he did know we were at sinai hospital on the second floor  he could spell world forward but wa mute when asked to spell backwards  he wa mute when asked to recall 33 object for delayed recall  he could not copy a diagram of intersecting pentagon  for comparison the minimental state exam score last december wa 2030 when attention wa tested by having him spell world backwards and 2830 when tested with serial 7 subtraction  additionally there are time when he stutter or stammer  i do not see any paraphasic error  there is some evidence of ideomotor apraxia  he is also stimulus bound  there is a tendency to mimiccranial nerve exam  there is no upgaze that i can elicit today  the horizontal gaze and down gaze are intact  this is a change from a year ago  the muscle of facial expiration are intact a are hearing head turning cough tongue and palate movementmotor exam  normal bulk and strength  the tone is characterized by paratonia  there is no atrophy fasciculation drift or tremorsensory exam  intact to light touchcerebellar exam  intact for fingertonose testing that he can perform only by mimicking but not by following verbal commandsgait  severely impaired  when in the wheelchair he lean to one side  he cannot getup on his own  he need assistance  once up he can bear weight but cannot maintain his balance  this would amount to a tinetti score of zeroreview of xrays  i personally reviewed the ct scan of the brain from november 1 2008 and compared it to the mri scan from a year ago  the ventricle appear larger to me now in comparison to a year ago  the frontal horn span is now 6 cm whereas previously it wa about 55 cm  the 3rd ventricular span is about 15 mm  there is no obvious atrophy although there may be some subtle bilateral perisylvian atrophy  the scan from a year ago showed that there wa a patent sylvian aqueductassessment  the patient ha had worsening of his gait his dementia and his incontinence  the new finding for me today is the limited upgaze  this would be consistent either with progressive supranuclear palsy which wa one of the differential diagnosis a year ago or it could be consistent with progressive enlargement of the ventriclesproblemsdiagnoses1  question of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus 33152  possible supranuclear palsy3  severe gait impairment4  urinary urgency and incontinence5  dementiaplan  i had a long talk with him and his family  even though he ha already had a trial of csf drainage via spinal catheter at hospital over a year ago i offered this test to them again  i do so on the basis that there is further enlargement of the ventricle on the scan  his family and i discussed the fact that it is not likely to be only hydrocephalus  instead we are trying to answer the question of whether hydrocephalus is contributing sufficiently to his symptom that progressing with shunt surgery would make a difference  i have advised them to think it over for a day and contact my office to see whether they would wish to proceed  i gave them a printed prescription of the protocol including it rationale risk benefit and alternative  i

generalclinical summary  the patient is a 37yearold righthand dominant hispanic female who sustained a severe fracture to the right wrist approximately one week ago  this wa an intraarticular fourpart fracture that wa displaced dorsally  in addition the patient previously undergone a carpal tunnel release but had symptom of carpal tunnel preop  she is admitted for reconstructive operation  the symptom of carpal tunnel were present preop and worsened after the injuryoperation  the patient wa brought from the ambulatory care unit and placed on the operating table in a supine position and administered general anesthetic by anesthesia  once adequate anesthesia had been obtained the right upper extremity wa prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner  tourniquet wa placed around the right upper extremity  the upper extremity wa then elevated and exsanguinated using an esmarch dressing  the tourniquet wa elevated to 250 mmhg  the entire operation wa performed with 45 loop magnification  at this time an approximately 8 cm longitudinal incision wa then made overlying the right flexor carpus radialis tendon from the flexion crease to the wrist proximally  this wa carried down to the flexor carpus radialis which wa then retracted ulnarly  the floor of the flexor carpus radialis wa then incised exposing the flexor pronator muscle  the flexor pollicis longus wa retracted ulnarly and the pronator quadratus wa longitudinally incised 1 cm from it origin  it wa then elevated off of the fracture site exposing the fracture site which wa dorsally displaced  this wa an intraarticular fourpart fracture  under image control the two volar piece and dorsal piece were then carefully manipulated and reduced  then 206 twoinch kwires were drilled radial into the volar ulnar fragment and then a second kwire wa then drilled from the dorsal radial to the dorsal ulnar piece  a third kwire wa then drilled from the volar radial to the dorsal ulnar piece  the fracture wa then manipulated  the fracture end were copiously irrigated with normal saline and curetted and then the fracture wa reduced in the usual fashion by recreating the defect and distracting it  further kwires were then placed through the radial styloid into the proximal fragment  a hand innovation dvr plate of regular size for the right wrist wa then fashioned over and placed over the distal radius and secured with two kwires  at this time the distal screw were then placed  the distal screw were the small screw  these were nonlocking screw all eight screw were placed  they were placed in the usual fashion by drilling with a small drill bit removing the small introducers and then using it depth  again these were 1820 mm screw  after placing three of the screw it wa necessary to remove the kwires  there wa excellent reduction of the fragment and the fracture excellent reduction of the intraarticular component and the fracture  after the distal screw were placed the fracture wa reduced and held in place with kwires which were replaced and the proximal screw were drilled with the drill guide and the larger drill bit  the screw were then placed  these were 12 mm screw  they were placed 4 in number  the kwires were then removed  finally a 3 cm intrathenar incision wa made beginning 1 cm distal to the flexor crease of the wrist  this wa carried down to the transverse carpal ligament which

who had her last coronary arteriogram performed in 2004 she ha had complaint of progressive chest discomfort and ha ongoing risk including current smoking diabetes hypertension hyperlipidemia to name a few the decision wa made to proceed on with percutaneous evaluation and possible intervention given her known disease and the possibility of disease progressiondescription of procedure after informed consent wa obtained the patient wa taken to cardiac catheterization lab where her procedure wa performed she wa prepped and prepared on the table after which her right groin wa locally anesthetized with 1 lidocaine then a 6french sheath wa inserted into the right femoral artery over a standard 0035 guide wire coronary angiography and left ventricular measurement and angiography were performed using a 6french jl4 diagnostic catheter to image the left coronary artery a 6french jr4 diagnostic catheter to image the right groin and her artery and the saphenous vein graft conduit subsequently a 6french angled pigtail catheter wa used to measure left ventricular pressure and to perform a power injection a left ventriculogram at 8 ml per second for a total of 30 ml at the conclusion of the diagnostic evaluation the patient had selective arteriography of her right femoral artery which showed the right femoral artery to be free of significant atherosclerotic plaque did have a normal bifurcation into the superficial femoral and profunda femoris artery and to have an arteriotomy that wa in the common femoral artery away from the bifurcation a such an initial attempt to advance a perclose device failed to allow the device descend to  tract and into the appropriate position within the artery a such the perclose wa never deployed and wa removed intact over the wire from the system we then replaced this with a 6french angioseal which wa used to seal the femoral arteriotomy with achievement of hemostasis the patient wa subsequently dispositioned back to the mac

the patient wa seen late because he had not filled in the patient questionnaire  to summarize the history here mr xyz who is not very clear on event from the past sustained a workrelated injury some time in 1998  at that time he wa driving an 18wheeler truck  the patient indicated that he slipped off the rear of his truck while loading vehicle to his trailer  he experienced severe low back pain and eventually a short while later underwent a fusion of l4l5 and l5s1  the patient had an uneventful hospital course from the surgery which wa done somewhere in florida by a surgeon who he doe not remember  he wa able to return to his usual occupation but then again had a second workrelated injury in may of 2005  at that time he wa required to boat truck to his rig and also to use a chainpulley system to raise and lower the vehicle  mr xyz felt a popping sound in his back and had excruciating low back pain and had to be transported to the nearest hospital  he wa mried at that time which apparently showed a reherniation of an l5s1 disc and then he somehow ended up in houston where he underwent fusion by dr w from l3 through s2  this wa done on 12152005  initially he did fairly well and wa able to walk and move around but then gradually the pain reappeared and he started getting severe leftsided leg pain going down the lateral aspect of the left leg into his foot  he is still

and there wa poor attendance of these visit there wa no clearance given for any surgical intervention and it wa felt that the patient ha benefited from the use of ssri  of concern in june of 2006 wa that the patient had still not stopped smoking despite warning  his hypertension and diabetes were still not under good control and the patient wa assessed at significant risk for additional health complication including stroke reduced mental clarity and future fall  it wa felt that any surgical intervention should be put on hold at that time  in september of 2006 the patient wa evaluated at baylor college of medicine in the occupational health program  the evaluation wa done by a physician at that time whose report is clearly documented in the record  evaluation wa done by dr b  at

of the system and continued obstruction  plan is for co surgeon due to the complexity of the situation and the solitary kidney to do surgical procedure to correct the obstructiondescription of operation  the patient wa taken to the operative room  surgical consent operative site and patient identification were verified  dr x and dr y both agreed upon the procedure in advance  dr y then once the patient wa anesthetized requested iv antibiotic with fortaz the patient had a caudal block placed and he wa then placed in lithotomy position  dr y then calibrated the urethra with the bougie a boule to 8 10 and up to 12 french  the 95french cystoscope sheath wa then placed within the patient bladder with the offset scope and his bladder had no evidence of cystitis  i wa able to locate the ureteral orifice bilaterally although no urine coming from the right  we then placed a 4french ureteral catheter into the ureter a far a we could go  an antegrade nephrostogram wa then performed which show that the contrast filled the dilated pelvis but did not go into the ureter  a retrograde wa performed and it wa found that there wa a narrowed band across the two  upon draining the ureter allowing to drain to gravity the pelvis which had been clamped and it nephrostomy tube did not drain at all  dr y then placed a 0035 guidewire into the ureter after removing the 4french catheter and then placed a 47french doublej catheter into the ureter a far a it would go allowing it to coil in the bladder  once this wa completed we then removed the cystoscope and sheath placed a 10french foley catheter and the patient wa positioned by dr x and dr y into the flank position with the left flank up after adequate padding on the arm and leg a well a a brachial plexus roll  he wa then sterilely prepped and draped  dr y then incised the skin with a 15blade knife through the old incision and then extended the incision with curved mosquito clamp and dr x performed cautery of the area advanced to be excised  once this wa then dissected dr y and dr x divided the lumbosacral fascia at the latissimus dorsi fascia posterior dorsal lumbotomy maneuver using the electrocautery and then using curved mosquito clamp   at this point dr x used the cautery to enter the posterior retroperitoneal space through the posterior abdominal fascia  dr y then used the curved right angle clamp and dissected around towards the ureter which wa markedly adherent to the base of the retroperitoneum  dr x and dr y also needed dissection on the medial and lateral aspect with dr y being on the lateral aspect of the area and dr x on the medial to get an adequate length of this  the tissue wa markedly inflamed and had significant adhesion noted  the patient spermatic vessel were also in the region a well a the renal vessel markedly scarred close to the ureteropelvic junction  ultimately dr y and dr x both with alternating dissection were able to dissect the renal pelvis to a position where dr y put stay suture and a 40 chromic to isolate the four quadrant area where we replaced the ureter  dr x then divided the ureter and suture ligated the base which wa obstructed with a 30 chromic suture  dr y then spatulated the ureter for about 15 cm and the stent wa gently delivered in a normal location out of the ureter at the proximal and left alone in the bladder  dr y then incised the renal pelvis and dissected and opened it enough to allow the new ureteropelvic junction repair to be performed  dr y then placed interrupted suture of 50 monocryl at the apex to repair the most dependent portion of the renal pelvis entered the lateral aspect interrupted suture of the repair  dr x then wa able to without much difficulty do interrupted suture on the medial aspect  the stent wa then placed into the bladder in the proper orientation and alternating suture by dr y and dr x closed the ureteropelvic junction without any evidence of leakage  once this wa complete we removed the extra stay stitch and watched the ureter lay back into the retroperitoneum in a normal position without any kinking in apparently good position  this opening wa at least 15 cm wide  dr y then placed 2 stay suture of 20 chromic in the lower pole of the kidney and then incised wedge biopsy and excised the biopsy with a 15blade knife and curved iris scissors for renal biopsy for determination of renal tissue health  electrocautery wa used on the base  there wa no bleeding however and the tissue wa quite soft  dermabond and gelfoam were placed and then dr y closed the biopsy site over with thrombingelfoam using the 20 chromic stay suture  dr x then closed the fascial layer with running suture of 30 vicryl in 3 layer  dr y closed the scarpa fascia and the skin with 40 vicryl and 40 rapide respectively  a 40 nylon suture wa then placed by dr y around the previous nephrostomy tube which wa again left clamped  dermabond tissue adhesive wa placed over the incision and then a dry

1834,preoperative diagnosis  left acoustic neuromapostoperative diagnosis  left acoustic neuromaprocedure performed  left retrosigmoid craniotomy and excision of acoustic neuromaanesthesia  generaloperative finding  this patient had a 3cm acoustic neuroma  the tumor wa incompletely excised leaving a remnant of the tumor along the cerebellopontine angle portion of the facial nerve  the facial nerve wa stimulated at the brainstem at 005 milliampere at the conclusion of the dissectionsprocedure in detail  following induction of adequate general anesthetic the patient wa positioned for surgery  she wa placed in a lateral position and her head wa maintained with mayfield pin  the left periauricular area wa shaved prepped and draped in the sterile fashion  transdermal electrode for continuous facial nerve emg monitoring were placed and no response wa verified  the proposed incision wa injected with 1 xylocaine with epinephrine  next tshaped incision wa made approximately 5 cm behind the postauricular crease  the incision wa undermined at the level of temporalis fascia and the portion of the fascia wa harvested for further useincision wa made along the inferior aspect of the temporalis muscle and then extended inferiorly over the mastoid tip  periosteal elevator wa used to elevate periosteum in order to expose the mastoid and anterior aspect of the occipital bone  emissary vein posterior to the sigmoid sinus were controlled with electrocautery and bone wax  bergen retractor were used to maintain exposure  using a cutting bur with continuous suction and irrigation of craniotomy wa performed  the sigmoid sinus wa identified anteriorly and the transverse site were identified superiorly  from these structure approximately 4 x 4 cm a window of bone wa removed  bone shaving were collected during the dissection and placed in siloxane suspension for later use  the bone flap wa also left at the site for further use  dissection wa extended along the inferior aspect of the sigmoid sinus to provide additional exposure of the skull base  bone wax wa used to occlude air cell lateral to the sigmoid sinus  there wa extensively aerated temporal bone  at this point dr trask entered the case in order to open the dura and expose the tumor  the cerebellum wa retracted away from the tumor and the retractor wa placed to help maintain exposure  once initial exposure wa completed attention wa directed to the posterior aspect of the temporal bone  the dura wa excised from around the porous acusticus extending posteriorly along the bone  then using diamond bur the internal auditory canal wa dissected out  the bone wa removed laterally for distance of approximately 8 mm  there wa considerable aeration around the internal auditory canal a well  the dura wa then incised over the internal auditory canal exposing the intracanalicular portion of the tumor  the tumor extended all the way to the fundus such that initial exposure of the facial nerve around the tumor wa difficult  therefore dr trask returned in order to further release the tumor from the brainstem and to debulk the central portion of the tumor  with dissection he released the tumor from the trigeminal nerve superiorly and elevated the tumor away from the dorsal brainstem  the eighth nerve wa identified and transected  tumor debulking allowed for retraction of the tumor capsule away from the brainstem  the facial nerve wa difficult to identify at the brainstem a well  it wa identified by using an electrical stimulator but dissection attempted at this time wa the plane between the nerve and the tumor proximally but this wa difficult to achieve  attention wa then redirected to the internal auditory canal where this portion of the tumor wa removed  the superior and inferior vestibular nerve were evulsed laterally and dissection proceeded along the facial nerve to the porous acusticus  at this point plane of dissection wa again indistinct  the tumor had been released from the porous and could be rotated  the tumor wa further debulked and thinned but could not crucially visualize the nerve on the anterior face of the tumor  the nerve could be stimulated but wa quite splayed over the anterior face  further debulking of the tumor proceeded and additional attempt were made to establish point of dissection along the nerve both proximally and distally  however the cerebellopontine angle portion of the nerve wa not usually delineated  however the tumor wa then thinned using cusa down to fine sheath measuring only about 1 to 2 mm in thickness  it wa released from the brainstem ventrally  the tumor wa then cauterized with bipolar electrocautery  the facial nerve wa stimulated at the brainstem and stimulated easily at 005 milliampere  overall the remaining tumor volume would be of small percentage of the original volume  at this point dr trask reinspected the posterior fossa to ensure complete hemostasis  the air cell around the internal auditory canal were packed off with muscle and bone wax  a piece of fascia wa then laid over the bone defect  next the dura wa closed with duragen and duraseal  the bone flap and bone  were then placed in the bone defect  postauricular musculature wa then reapproximated using interrupted 30 vicryl suture  the skin wa also closed using interrupted subdermal 30 vicryl suture  running 40 nylon suture wa placed at the skin level  sterile mastoid dressing wa then placed  the patient tolerated the procedure well and wa transported to the pacu in a stable condition  all count were correct at the conclusion of the procedureestimated blood loss  100 ml ,2.0
4007,title of operation  rightsided craniotomy for evacuation of a right frontal intracranial hemorrhageindication for surgery  the patient is very well known to our service  in brief the patient is status post orbitozygomatic resection of a pituitary tumor with a very large intracranial component basically a very large skullbased brain tumor  he wa taken to the operating room for the orbitozygomatic approach  intraoperatively everything went well without any complication  the brain at the end of the procedure wa absolutely intact but the patient developed a seizure in the intensive care unit and then wa taken to the ct scan developed a second seizure  he wa given ativan for this and then began to identify a large component measuring about 3 x 3 cm of the right frontal lobe what appeared to be a hemorrhagic conversion of potential venous infarct  i had a long discussion immediately with dr x and dr y  we decided to take the patient immediately a a level 1 for evacuation of this hematoma with a small amount of a midline shift with an intraventricular component  it worried me and i think that we needed to go ahead and take him to the operating room immediately  the patient wa taken a a level 1 immediately and emergently and into the operating room for this procedure  the original plan wa to do first a rightsided orbitozygomatic procedure and then stage it a few week later with an endonasal endoscopic procedure for resection of this pituitary tumor component  he wa taken to the operating room for evacuation of a right frontal intraparenchymal hematomapreop diagnosis  pituitary tumor with a large intracranial component status post resection and now development of an intracranial hemorrhagepostop diagnosis  intracranial hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe with extension into the intraventricular space after resection of a pituitary tumor via orbitozygomatic approachanesthesia  generalprocedure in detail  the patient wa taken to the operating room  in the supine position his head wa put in a horseshoe without any complication  the patient tolerated this very well and the prior incision wa immediately opened  the surgery had taken place a few hour prior to this the original orbitozygomatic approach  at this point this wa a lifesaving procedure  we went ahead opened the old incision after everything wa sterilely prepped and all the surgical instrumentation wa brought into place  we went ahead and opened the incision and took out the pterional bone flap without any complication  we immediately opened the dura expeditiously and the brain wa moderately under some pressure but not really bulging out  so i went ahead and identified an area over the right frontal lobe that wa a little bit consistent with a hemorrhagic infarct and nonviable tissue  so we went ahead and did a corticectomy right there and identified the actual clot immediately and went ahead and over the next few hour very meticulously began to evacuate these clot without any complication whatsoever  we went all the way down to the ventricle and identified this clot in the ventricle and went ahead and removed this clot without any complication and we had a very nice resection  the brain wa very relaxed  we had a very good resection of the actual blood clot and the brain wa very relaxed  we irrigated thoroughly  we identified the ventricle  we went ahead and did a very careful hemostasis with avitene with thrombin and gelfoam with thrombin over the next time in doing the procedure  all this wa done very well and then we lined the cavity with surgicel and the surgicel wa only put at the edge and draping down a to not to leave any fragment potentially to communicate with the actual ventricle and then after this everything wa good  we went ahead and closed back the actual dura back  we had done a pericranial flap  this wa also put back in place and the dura wa closed with 40 surgilons  we reconstructed everything  the frontal sinus wa reconstructed thoroughly without any complication  we went ahead and put once again a watertight closure and went ahead and put another piece of duragen with hemaseel in place and went ahead and put the bone flap back and reconstructed very nicely once again with selftapping selfdrilling screw lowprofile plate  once everything wa confirmed to be in place we went ahead and closed the muscle flap and also the actual fat pad wa put back into place and closed together with 0 popoffs and the skin with staple without any complication  in summary the procedure wa going back to the operating room for evacuation of a rightsided intracranial hemorrhage most likely a conversion of an intraparenchymal hematoma with extension into the ventricle without any complication  so everything wa stable  estimated blood loss wa about 100 cubic centimeter  the sponge and needle count were correct  no specimen were sent to pathologydisposition  the patient after this procedure wa brought to the neuro intensive care unit for close observation ,1.0

3294,procedure  left heart catheterization left and right coronary angiography left ventricular angiography and intercoronary stenting of the right coronary arteryprocedure in detail  the patient wa brought to the catheterization laboratory  after informed consent he wa medicated with versed and fentanyl  the right groin wa prepped and draped and infiltrated with 2 xylocaine  percutaneously 6french arterial sheath wa placed  selective native left and right coronary angiography wa performed followed by left ventricular angiography  the patient had a totally occluded right coronary  we initially started with a jr4 guide  we were able to a sport wire through the total occlusion and saw a very tight stenosis  we were able to get a 30 x 13 mm power saver balloon into the stenosis and dilated  we then attempted to put a 30 x 12 mm stent across the stenosis but we had very little guide support the guide kept coming out  we then switched to an al1 guide and that too did not enable u to get anything to cross this lesion  we finally had to go an al2 guide we were concerned that this could cause some proximal dissection  that guided seated we did have initial difficulty getting the wire back across the stenosis and we did see a little staining suggesting we did have some tearing from the guide tip  the surgeon were put on notice in case we could not get this vessel open but we were able to recross with a sport wire  we then redilated the area of stenosis and with good guide support we were able to get a 30 x 23 mm vision stent where the lesion wa and postdilated it to 18 atmosphere  routine angiography did show that the distal posterolateral branch seems to be occluded whether this wa from distal wire dissection or distal thrombosis wa unclear but we were able to rewire that area and get a 25 x12 vision balloon and dilate the area and reestablish flow to the small segment  we then came back because of the residual dissection proximal to the first stent and put a 30 x15 mm vision stent at 18 atmosphere  final angiography showed resolution of the dissection  we could see a little staining extrinsic to the stent  no perforation and excellent flow  during the intervention we did give a bolus and drip of angiomax  at the end of the procedure we stopped the angiomax and gave 600 mg of plavix  we did a right femoral angiogram however the angioseal plug could not take so we used manual pressure and a femostop  we transported the patient to his room in stable conditionangiographic data  left main coronary is normal  left anterior descending artery ha a fair amount of wall disease proximally about 50 to 60 stenosis of the lad before it bifurcates into diagonal  the diagonal doe appear to have about 50 osteal stenosis  there is a lot of plaquing further down the diagonal but good flow  the rest of the lad looked good pas the proximal 60 stenosis and after the diagonal branch  circumflex artery wa nondominant vessel consisting of an obtuse marginal vessel  the first obtuse marginal had a long 50 narrowing and then the av groove branch wa free of any disease  some mild collateral to the right were seen  right coronary angiography revealed a total occlusion of the right coronary just about 05 cm after it origin  after we got a wire across the area of occlusion we could see some thrombosis and a 99 stenosis just at the curve  following the balloon angioplasty we established good flow down the distal vessel  we still had about residual 70 stenosis  when we had to go back with the al2 guide we could see a little bit of staining in the proximal portion of the vessel that we did not notice previously and we felt that the tip of the guide caused a little bit of intimal dissection  we redilated and then deployed  repeat angiography now did show some hang up off dye distally  we never did have the wire that far down so this wa probably felt to be due to distal embolization of some thrombus  after deploying the stent we had total resolution of the original lesion  we then directed our attention to the posterolateral branch which the remainder of the vessel wa patent giving off a large pda  the posterolateral branch appeared to be occluded in it mid portion  we got a wire through and dilated this  we then came back and put a second stent in the proximal area of the right coronary proximal and abutting to the previous stent  repeat angiography now showed no significant dissection a little bit of contrast getting extrinsic to the stent probably in a little subintimal pouch but this wa excluded by the stent  there were no filling defect in the stent and excellent flow  the distal posterolateral branch did open up although it wa little underfilled and there may have been some mild residual disease thereimpression  atherosclerotic heart disease with total occlusion of right coronary successfully stented to zero residual with repair of a small proximal dissection  minor distal disease of the posterolateral branch and 60 proximal left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis and 50 diagonal stenosis along with 50 stenosis of the first obtuse marginal branch ,1.0

carvedilol 25 mg twice daily  in addition he could benefit from a loop diuretic such a furosemide  i did not start this a he is planning to go back home to san salvador tomorrow  i will leave that up to his local physician to uptitrate the medication and get him started on some furosemidein term of the dilated cardiomyopathy there is not much further that need to be done except for family screening  all of his sibling and his child should have an ekg and an echocardiogram to make sure they have not developed the same thing  there is a strong genetic component of thisi will see him again in 3 to 6 month whenever he can make it back here  he doe not need a defibrillator right now and my plan would be to get him on the right dos of the right medication and then recheck an echocardiogram 3 month later  if his lv function ha not improved he doe have new york heart association class ii symptom and so he would benefit from a prophylactic icdthank you for asking me to

supine position  the right foot wa prepared and draped in usual sterile manner  anesthesia wa achieved utilizing a 5050 mixture of 2 lidocaine plain with 05 marcaine plain infiltrated just proximal to the first metatarsocuneiform joint  hemostasis wa achieved utilizing a pneumatic ankle tourniquet placed above the right ankle and inflated to a pressure of 225 mmhg  at this time attention wa directed to the dorsal aspect of the right first metatarsophalangeal joint where dorsal linear incision approximately 3 cm in length wa made  the incision wa deepened within the same plain taking care of the bovie and retracted all superficial nerve and vessel a necessary  the incision wa then carried down to the underlying capsular structure once again taking care of the bovie and retracted all superficial nerve and vessel a necessary  the capsular incision following the same outline a the skin incision wa made and carried down to the underlying bony structure  the capsule wa then freed from the underling bony structure utilizing sharp and blunt dissection  using a microsagittal saw the medial and dorsal very prominent bony eminence were removed and the area wa inspected for any remaining bony prominence following resection of bone and those noted were removed using a hand rasp  at this time attention wa directed to the first inner space using sharp and blunt dissection  dissection wa carried down to the underling level of the adductor hallucis tendon which wa isolated and freed from it phalangeal sesamoidal and metatarsal attachment  the tendon wa noted to lap the length and integrity for transfer and at this time wa tenotomized taking out resection of approximately 05 cm to help prevent any refibrous attachment  at this time the lateral release wa stressed and wa found to be complete  the extensor hallucis brevis tendon wa then isolated using blunt dissection and wa tenotomized a well taking out approximately 05cm resection  the entire area wa copiously flushed 3 time using a sterile saline solution and wa inspected for any bony prominence remaining and it wa noted that the base of the proximal phalanx on the medial side due to the removal of the extensive buildup of the metatarsal head wa going to be very prominent in nature and at this time wa removed using a microsagittal saw  the area wa again copiously flushed and inspected for any abnormality andor prominence and none were noted  at this time attention wa directed to the base of the first metatarsal where a second incision wa made approximately 4 cm in length  the incision wa deepened within the same plain taking care of bovie and retracted all superficial nerve and vessel a necessary  the incision wa then carried down to the level of the metatarsal and using sharp and blunt dissection periosteal capsule structure were freed from the base of the metatarsal and taking care to retract the long extensive tendon and any neurovascular structure to avoid any disruption  at this time there wa a measurement made of 1 cm just distal to the metatarsocuneiform joint on the medial side and 2 cm distal to the metatarsocuneiform joint from the lateral aspect of the joint  at this time 05 cm wa measured distal to that lateral measurement and using microsagittal saw a wedge osteotomy wa taken from the base with the apex of the osteotomy being medial taking care to keep the medial cortex intact a a hinge  the osteotomy site wa feathered down until the osteotomy site could be closed with little tension on it and at this time using an orthopro screw 30 x 22 mm  the screw wa placed following proper technique  the osteotomy site wa found to be fixated with absolutely no movement and good stability upon manual testing  a very tiny gap on the lateral aspect of the osteotomy site wa found and this wa filled in packing it with the cancellous bone that wa left over from the wedge osteotomy  the packing of the cancellous bone wa held in place with bone wax  the entire area wa copiously flushed 3 time using a sterile saline solution and wa inspected and tested again for any movement of the osteotomy site or any gapping and then removed  at this time a deep closure wa achieved utilizing 20 vicryl suture subcuticular closure wa achieved using 40 vicryl suture and skin repair wa achieved at both surgical site with 50 nylon suture in a running interlocking

minutescomponents  a zimmer nexgen legacy knee size d right stemmed femoral component wa used  a nexgen femoral component with a distal femoral augmented block size 5 mm  a nexgen tibial component size 3 mm wa used  a size 14 mm constrained polyethylene surface wa used a well  original patellar component that the patient had wa maintainedcomplications  nonebrief history  the patient is a 68yearold female with a history of knee pain for 13 year  she had previous total knee arthroplasty and revision at an outside facility  she had continued pain snapping malalignment difficulty with ambulation and giving away and wished to undergo additional revision surgeryprocedure  the patient wa taken to the operative suite and placed on the operating table  department of anesthesia administered the spinal anesthetic  once adequately anesthetized the patient wa placed in a supine position  care wa ensured and she wa adequately secured and well padded in position  once this wa obtained the right lower extremity wa prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion  tourniquet wa inflated to approximately 325 mmhg on the right thigh  at this point an incision wa made over her anterior previous knee scar taking this down to the subcutaneous tissue of the overlying retinaculum  a medial parapatellar arthrotomy wa then made by using a second knife and this wa taken both distally and proximally to allow u to sublux the patella on the lateral aspect to allow exposure to the joint surface  there wa noted to be no evidence of purulence or gross clinical appearance of infection however intraoperative culture were taken to ass this a well  at this point the previous articular surface wa then removed using an osteotome until this wa left free and then removed  this wa done without difficulty  attention wa then directed removing the femoral component  osteotome wa taken around each of the edge until this wa gently lifted up and then a femoral extractor wa placed around it and this wa back flapped until this wa easily removed  after this wa performed attention wa then directed to the tibial component  an osteotome wa again inserted around the surface and this wa easily pried loose  there wa noted to be minimal difficulty with this and did not appear to have adequate cement fixation  this wa evaluated  the bone stalk appeared to be adequate however there were noted to be some deficit where we need to trim cement so we elected to proceed with stemmed component  the attention wa first directed to the femur and the femoral canal wa opened up and superficially reamed up to a size 18 mm proximal portion for the zimmer stemmed component  at this point the distal femoral cut wa evaluated with a intramedullary guide and this wa noted to be cut in a varus cut leaving u a large deficit of the medial femoral cut  we elected because of this large amount of retic to take off the medial condyle to correct this varus cut to a six degree valgus cut  we elected to augment the medial aspect and take only 5 mm off of the lateral condyle instead of a full 10 to 12  at this point the distal femoral cutting guide based on the intramedullary head wa then placed  care wa ensured that this wa aligned in proper rotation with the external epicondylar axis  once this wa pinned in position approximately a six degree valgus cut wa then made  this allowed a portion of the medial condyle to be removed distally  the anterior cut wa checked next using the intramedullary guide  the anterior surface cutting block wa then placed  this aligned u to anterior cutting blockwe ensured again that rotation wa aligned with the epicondylar axis  once this wa adequately aligned with this and gave u some external rotation this wa pinned in position and new anterior cut wa made  it wa noted that minimal bone wa taken off the surface only a slight portion on the medial anterior surface   wa then removed and the chamfer cutting guide wa then placed on  this allowed u to make a box cut and recut some of the angled cut of the distal femur  once this wa placed and pinned in position  care wa then again taken to check that this wa in proper rotation and then the chamfer cut were recut  it wa noted that the anterior chamfer did not need to be cut take off no bone  the posterior chamfer did remove some bony aspect  this wa also taken off some of the posterior aspect of the condyle and then the ossicle saw and reciprocal saw were used to take off a notch cut to open up a constrained component  after all these cut were taken the guide were then removed and the trial component with a medial 5 mm augment wa then placed  this appeared to have an adequate fit and then packed in position  it appeared to be satisfactory  at this point this wa removed and attention wa then directed to the tibia  the intramedullary canal wa again opened up using a proximal drill and this wa reamed to the appropriate size until good  wa obtained  at this point the intramedullary guide wa used to evaluate a tibial cut  this appeared to be adequate however we elected to remove 2 mm of bone to give u a new fresh bony surface  the cutting guide wa placed in adequate alignment and checked both the with intramedullary guide and an external alignment rod which allowed u to ensure that we had proper external rotation of this tibial component  at this point this wa pinned in position and the tibial cut wa made to remove an extra 2 mm of bone  this wa again removed and a trial tibial stemmed component wa then placed a well a the trial augmented stemmed femoral component  this wa placed in a proper position  a 10 mm articular surface wa placed in the knee and this wa taken through range of motion  this wa found to have better alignment and satisfactory position  we elected to take an intraoperative xray at this point to evaluate our cut  the intraoperative xray demonstrates satisfactory cut and alignment of the prosthesis  at this point all trial were removed  the patella wa then examined  the rongeur wa used to remove the surrounding synovium  the patella wa evaluated and found to have mild wear on the lateral aspect of the inferior butt however this wa very mild and overall had a good position and wa well fixed to the bone  it wa elected at this time to maintain this anatomic patella that wa previously placed  at this point the joint again wa reevaluated and any bone loose fragment removed  there wa noted to be some posterior tightness and mild osteophyte  these were removed with a rongeurat this time while preparing the canal the tourniquet wa deflated due to it being 123 minute  approximately 10 minute did get by a the knee wa copiously irrigated and suctioned dried  the tourniquet wa then reinflated  the canal were prepped for cementing  they were suctiondried and cleaned  the tibial component wa cemented and then impacted into position and ensured it wa adequately aligned in proper external rotation and alignment that wa previously tried with the trial  once this wa fixed and secured all extra cement wa removed and attention wa directed to the femoral component  the stemmed femoral component wa then impacted in position and cemented  again care wa ensured that it wa in adequate position and proper rotation  a size 14 mm poly wa then inserted in between to provide compression  this wa then taken through extension and held until cement cured  this wa then removed and the component were evaluated  all excess cement wa removed and they were well fixed  size 14 mm trial poly wa then placed and this wa taken through range of motion  this wa found to have excellent range of motion and good stability  it wa elected at this time that we would go with the size 14 mm poly  this gave u extra poly for ware and then provide excellent contact throughout the range of motion  the final articular surface wa then placed and tightened into position to allow to  secured  the knee wa then reduced and the knee wa taken through range of motion  the patella wa tracking with notouch technique and adequately positioned  at this point the tourniquet wa deflated for second time and then the knee wa copiously irrigated and suctioned dry  all bleeding wa cauterized using a bovie cautery  the retinaculum wa then repaired using 1 ethibond in a figureofeight fashion  this wa reinforced with a running 20 vicryl  the knee wa then flexed and noted that the patella wa tracking with good alignment  the wound wa again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry  a drain wa placed prior to retinaculum repair deep to this to provide adequate drainage  at this point the subcutaneous tissue wa closed with 20 vicryl  skin wa approximated with skin clip  sterile dressing of adaptic 4x4 webril and abds were then placed  a large dupre dressing wa then placed up the entire lower extremity  the patient wa then transferred back to recovery in supine positiondisposition  the patient tolerated the procedure
