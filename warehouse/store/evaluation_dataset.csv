certainly there is significant exaggeration of the underlying problem and her neurological examination is compounded by much functional overlay limiting the interpretation of my finding  i suspect

right paratracheal region extending into the precarinal region the subcarinal region and the right hilum  this wa causing some compression on the inferior aspect of the svc and also some narrowing of the right upper lobe pulmonary artery  there wa an abnormal lymph node noted in the ap window and left hilar region  there wa another spiculated mass within the right upper lobe measuring 20 x 15 cm  there wa also an 8 mm noncalcified nodule noted in the posteriorinferior aspect of the left upper lobe suspicious for metastatic disease  there were area of atelectasis particularly in the right base  there wa also some mild ground glass opacity within the right upper lobe adjacent to the right hilum potentially representing focal area of pulmonary edema versus small infarction related to the right upper lobe pulmonary artery narrowing  there wa a small lucency adjacent to the medial aspect of the left upper lobe compatible with a small pneumothorax  in the abdomen there wa a mass involved in the left adrenal gland a well a a nodule involving the right adrenal gland both of which appeared necrotic compatible with metastatic tumor  all other structure appeared normal  on 122208 a ctguided

47yearold gentleman without much past medical history who now present with metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer  at this point he and his wife ask about whether this is curable disease and it wa difficult to inform that this wa not curable disease but would be treatable  his wife particularly had a very hard time with this prognosis  they preferred not to know the exact average a to how long someone life with this disease  i did offer chemotherapy a a way to treat this disease  chemotherapy ha been associated both with palliation of symptom a well a prolong survival  at this point he ha an excellent functional status and i think he would tolerate chemotherapy quite wellin term of chemotherapy i talked briefly about the side affect including but not limited to gi upset diarrhea nausea vomiting mucositis fatigue loss of appetite low blood count including the possible need for transfusion a well a the risk of infection which in some rare case can be fatal  i would likely use carboplatin and gemcitabine  this would be both medication given on day 1 with a dose of gemcitabine on day 8  this cycle will be repeated after 1week break so that the cycle last 21 day  the goal will be to complete 6 cycle of this a long a he is responding and tolerating the medicationin term of staging mr abcds had all the appropriate staging  a petct scan could be done but at this point would not provide much mean full information beyond the ct scan that we haveat this point his biggest issue is pain and he is getting a pain consult to help control his pain  he will be ready to be discharged from the hospital once his pain is under better control  a this is the holiday weekend i do not have a way of scheduling a followup appointment with them but i did give he and his wife my card and instructed them to call on monday  at that point we will get him in and i will also begin working on making arrangement for his chemotherapythank you very much for this interesting consult

the level of l3l4 region  once inserted into the thecal sac we immediately got cerebrospinal fluid through the spinal needle  at this time approximately 10 cc of conray injected into the thecal sac  the patient wa then placed in the reversed trendelenburg position in order to assist with distal migration of the contrast  the myelogram did reveal that there wa some space occupying lesion most likely disc at the level of l5s1 on the left  there wa a lack of space filling defect on the left evident on both the ap and the lateral projection using carm fluoroscopy  at this point the patient wa then fully prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for this procedure for a microdiscectomy  a long spinal needle wa then inserted into region of surgery on the right  the surgery wa going to be on the left  once the spinal needle wa inserted a localizing fluoroscopy wa then used to assure appropriate location and this did confirm that we were at the l5s1 nerve root region  at this time an approximately 2 cm skin incision wa made over the lumbar region dissected down to the deep lumbar fascia  at this time a weitlaner wa inserted  bovie cautery wa used to obtain hemostasis  we further continued through the deep lumbar fascia and dissected off the short lumbar muscle off of the spinous process and the lamina  a cobb elevator wa then used to elevate subperiosteally off of all the

wa performed a small  curette wa used to elevate the ligamentum flavum off of the thecal sac a well a the adjoining nerve root  once the ligamentum flavum wa removed we immediately identified a piece of disc material floating around outside of the disc space over the s1 nerve root which wa compressive  we removed the extruded disc with further freeing up of the s1 nerve root  a nerve root retractor wa then placed  identification of disc space wa then performed  a 15 blade wa then inserted and small a key hole into the disc space wa then performed with a 15 blade  a small pituitary wa then inserted within the disc space and more disc material wa freed and removed  the part of the annulus fibrosis were also removed in addition to the loose intranuclear piece of disc  once this wa performed we removed the retraction off the nerve root and the nerve root appeared to be free with pulsatile visualization of the vasculature indicating that the nerve root wa essentially freeat this time copious irrigation wa used to irrigate the wound  we then performed another look to see if any loose piece of disc were extruding from the disc space and only small piece were evident and they were then removed with the pituitary rongeur  at this time a small piece of gelfoam wa then used to cover the exposed nerve root  we did not have any dural leak during this case  10 vicryl wa then used to approximate the deep lumbar fascia 20 vicryl wa used to approximate the superficial lumbar fascia and 40 running vicryl for the subcutaneous skin  sterile dressing were then applied  the patient wa then carefully slipped over into the supine position extubated and transferred to recovery in stable condition  at this time we are still waiting to ass the patient postoperatively to

appropriate for this situation there is a gradient of at most 2 mmhg on pullback from both the right and left pulmonary artery to the glenn shunt the left atrial mean pressure is normal right ventricular enddiastolic pressure is at most slightly elevated there is a trivial gradient between the right ventricle and ascending aorta consistent with trivial neoaortic valve stenosis there is a

measure 30 mm the aorta at the diaphragm on a later injection wa 55 mm there is a small collateral off the innominate vein passing to the left upper lobe flow to both upper lobe is diminished versus lower lung field there is normal return of the pulmonary vein from the right with simultaneous filling of the left atrium and right atrium there is normal return of the left lower pulmonary vein and left upper pulmonary vein there is some reflux of dye into the inferior vena cava from the right atriumthe right ventriculogram demonstrates a heavily pedunculated right ventricle with somewhat depressed right ventricular systolic function the calculated ejection fraction from the lao projection is only mildly diminished at 59 there is no significant tricuspid regurgitation the neoaortic valve appears to open well with no stenosis the ascending aorta is dilated there is mild narrowing of the aorta at the isthmal area on some projection there appears to be a partial duplication of the aortic arch probably secondary to this patient style of norwood reconstruction there is some filling of the right upper and left upper lobe from collateral blood flow with the left being more opacified than the rightthe inferior vena cavagram demonstrates normal return of the inferior vena cava to the right atriumthe ascending aortogram demonstrates trivial aortic insufficiency which is

the heart reveals minimal atherosclerosis with the area of greatest stenosis 20 stenosis at the bifurcation of the ladaorta  there is minimal atherosclerosis with no measurable plaque along the full length of the ascending and descending aortalungs  the right lung weighed 630 gram the left weighed 710 gram  the lung parenchyma is pink without evidence of congestion of hemorrhage  the bronchus are grossly normal  in the right lung there are two large organizing thromboemboli  the first is located at the first branch of the pulmonary artery with an older organizing area adherent to the vessel wall measuring 10 x 10 x 25 cm  surrounding this organizing area is a newer area of apparent thrombosis completely occluding the bifurcation  the other large organizing adherent embolus is located further in out in the vasculature measuring approximately 10 x 10 x 15 cm  there are multiple other embolus located in smaller pulmonary vessel that show evidence of distending the vessel they are located insidegastrointestinal system  the esophagus and stomach are normal in appearance without evidence of ulcer or varix  the stomach contains approximately 800 ml without evidence of any pill or other nonfoodstuff material  the pancreas show a normal lobular cut surface with evidence of autolysis  the duodenum ileum jejunum and colon are all grossly normal without evidence of abnormal vasculature or diverticulum  an appendix is present and is unremarkable  the liver weighs 2850 gram and the cut surface reveals a normal liver with no fibrosis present grossly  the gallbladder is in

inflammation or embolusendocrine system  the adrenal gland are in the normal position and weigh 80 gram on the right and 116 gram on the left  the cut surface of the adrenal gland reveals a normal appearing cortex and medulla  the thyroid gland weighs 124 gram and is grossly normalextremities  both leg and calf were measured and found to be very similar in circumference  both leg were also milked and produced no clot in the venous systemclinicopathologic correlationthis patient died shortly after a previous pulmonary embolus completely occluded the right pulmonary artery vasculature the most significant finding on autopsy wa the presence of multiple old and new thromboemboli in the pulmonary vasculature of the right lung  the autopsy revealed evidence of multiple embolus in the right lung that were at least a few day old because the embolus that were organizing were adherent to the vessel wall  in order to be adherent to the vessel wall the embolus must be in place long enough to evoke a fibroblast response which take at least a few day  the fatal event wa not the old embolus in the right lung but rather the thrombosis on top of the large saddle thrombus residing in the pulmonary artery  this created a highpressure situation that the right ventricle could not handle resulting in cardiac dysfunction and ultimately the patient demisealthough this case is fairly straight forward in term of what caused the terminal event perhaps the more interesting question is why a relatively healthy 35yearold man would develop a fatal pulmonary embolism  virchow triad suggests we should investigate endothelial injury stasis and a hypercoagulable state a possible etiology  the age of the patient probably precludes venous stasis a the sole reason for the embolus although it could have certainly contributed  the autopsy revealed no evidence of endothelial damage in the pulmonary vasculature that would have caused the occlusion  the next logical reason would be a hypercoagulable state  some possibility include obesity trauma surgery cancer factor v leiden deficiency a well a other inherited disordersprothrombin gene mutation deficiency in protein c protein s or antithrombin iii and disorder of plasminogen and lupus anticoagulant  of these risk factor obesity wa the only risk factor the patient wa known to have  the patient had no evidence of trauma surgery cancer or the stigma of sle therefore these are unlikely  perhaps the most fruitful search would be an examination of the genetic possibility for a hypercoagulable state factor v leiden being the most commonin summary this patient died of a pulmonary embolism the underlying cause of which is currently undetermined  a definitive diagnosis may be ascertained with either genetic or other laboratory test and a more detailed historysummary and reflectionwhat i learned from this autopsy  i learned that although a cause of death may sometimes be obvious the underlying mechanism for the death may still be elusive  this patient wa an otherwise completely healthy 35yearold man with one known risk factor for a hypercoagulable stateremaining unanswered question  basically the cause of the hypercoagulable state is undetermined  once that question is answered i believe this autopsy will have done a great service for the patient family ,2.0

obtaining informed consent from the patient including a thorough explanation of the risk and benefit of the aforementioned procedure the patient wa taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia wa administered  next the patient chest and leg were prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion  a 10blade scalpel wa used to make a midline median sternotomy incision  dissection wa carried down to the level of the sternum using bovie electrocautery  the sternum wa opened with a sternal saw and fulldose heparinization wa given  next the chest retractor wa positioned  the pericardium wa opened with bovie electrocautery and pericardial stay suture were positioned  we then prepared to place the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass  a 20 ethibond double pursestring wa placed in the ascending aorta  through this wa passed our aortic cannula and connected to the arterial side of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine  next double cannulation with venous cannula wa instituted  a 30 prolene pursestring wa placed in the right atrial appendage  through this wa passed our sec cannula  this wa connected to the venous portion of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine in a yshaped circuit  next a 30 prolene pursestring wa placed in the lower border of the right atrium  through this wa passed our inferior vena cava cannula  this wa likewise connected to the y connection of our venous cannula portion  we then used a 40 ustitch in the right atrium for our retrograde cardioplegia catheter which wa inserted  cardiopulmonary bypass wa instituted  metzenbaum scissors were used to dissect out the svc and ivc which were subsequently encircled with umbilical tape  sondergaards groove wa taken down  next an antegrade cardioplegia needle and associated sump were placed in the

ha a history of vascular dementia so her history is somewhat unreliable it seems and she is somnolent at that time  she doe have chronic atrial fibrillation again documented at least present since 2007 and i found an ekg report by dr x which show atrial fibrillation on 082907 per her report  one of the question we were asked wa whether the patient would be a candidate for coumadin  clearly given her history of small ministrokes i think coumadin would be appropriate given this chronic atrial fibrillation but the main issue is the fall risk  if not felt to be significant fall risk then i would strongly recommend coumadin a the patient herself state that she ha only fallen twice in the past year  i would defer that decision to dr z and dr xy who know the patient well and it may be that physical therapy consult is appropriate to help adjudicaterecommendations1  fall assessment a per dr z and dr xy with possible pt consult if felt appropriate and if the patient is not felt to be at significant fall risk would put her on coumadin  given her history of small stroke a documented in the chart and her chronic atrial fibrillation she doe have reasonable heart rate control on current labetalol2  the patient ha elevated bnp and i suspect that is due to her severe pulmonary hypertension and renal failure and in the light of normal lv function i would not make any further evaluation of that other than aggressive diuresis3  regarding this minimal troponin elevation i do not feel this is a diagnosis especially in the setting of pulmonary hypertension and her smalltomoderate sized stable pericardial effusion again that ha been longstanding since 2007 from what i can tell and there is no evidence of tamponade  i would defer to her usual cardiologist dr x whether an outpatient stress evaluation is appropriate for risk stratification  i did find that the patient had a prior cardiac stress test in 0807 where they felt that there wa some subtle reversibility of the anterior wall but it wa felt that it may be artifact rather than true ischemia with normal lv function seen on that study a well4  continue norvasc for history of hypertension a well a labetalol5  the patient is felt to be a significant fall risk and will at least continue her aspirin 81 mg once a day for secondary cva thromboprophylaxis albeit understanding that it is inferior to coumadin6  continue dilantin for history of seizure ,1.0

second episode 2 week following and suffered a marked dorsal deformity  the patient wa evaluated but did not complain of nasal obstruction and his main complaint wa his cosmetic deformity  he wa found to have a cshaped deformity to the left a well a some tip ptosis  the patient wa recommended to undergo an open septorhinoplasty to repair of this cosmetic defectoperation in detail  after obtaining a full consent from the patient identified the patient prepped with betadine brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position on the operating table  the appropriate esmarch wa placed and after adequate sedation the patient wa subsequently intubated without difficulty  the endotracheal tube wa then secured and the table wa then turned clockwise to 90 degree  three afrinsoaked cottonoids were then placed in nasal cavity bilaterally  the septum wa then injected with 3 ml of 1 lidocaine with 1100000 epinephrine in the subperichondrial plane bilaterally  then 50 additional ml of 1 lidocaine with 1100000 epinephrine wa then injected into the nose in preparation for an open rhinoplastyprocedure wa begun by first marking a columellar incision  this incision wa made using a 15 blade  a lateral transfixion incision wa then made bilaterally using a 15 blade and then the columellar incision wa completed using iris scissors with care not to injure the medial crus  however there wa a dissection injury to the left medial crus  dissection wa then taken in the subperichondrial plane over the lower lateral cartilage and then on to the upper lateral cartilage  once we reached the nasal bone a freer wa used to elevate the tissue overlying the nasal bone in a subperiosteal fashion  once we had completed exposure of the bony cartilaginous structure we appreciated a very large dorsal hump which wa made up of both a cartilaginous and bony portion  there wa also an obvious fracture of the right upper lateral cartilage  there wa also marked hypertrophy what appeared to be in the nasalis muscle in the area of the dorsal hump  the skin wa contributing to the patient cosmetic deformity  in addition we noted what appeared to be a small mucocele coming from the area of the fractured cartilage on the right upper lateral cartilage  this mucocele wa attempted to be dissected free most of which wa removed via dissection  we then proceeded to remove takedown of the dorsal hump using a rubin osteotome  the dorsal hump wa taken down and passed off the table  examination of the specimen revealed the marking amount of scar tissue at the junction of the bone and cartilage  this wa passed off to use later for possible onlay graft  there wa now a marked open roof deformity of the cartilage and bony sprue  a septoplasty wa then performed throughout and a kelly incision on the right side  subperichondrial plane were elevated on the right side and then a cartilage wa incised using a caudal and subperichondrial plane elevated on the left side  a 2 x 3cm piece of the cardinal cartilage wa then removed with care to leave at least 1 cm dorsal and caudal septal strut  this cartilage wa passed down the table and then 2 columellar strut graft measuring approximately 15 mm in length were then used and placed to close the bony and cartilaginous open roof deformity  the spreader graft were sewn in place using three interrupted 50 pd suture placed in the horizontal fashion bilaterally  once these were placed we then proceeded to work on the bony open roof  lateral osteotomy were made with 2mm osteotomes bilaterally  the nasal bone were then fashioned medially to close the open roof deformity and this reduced the width of the bony nasal dorsum  we then proceeded to the tip  a cartilaginous strut wa then fashioned from the cartilaginous septum  it wa approximately 15 mm long  this wa placed and a pocket wa just formed between the medial crus  this pocket wa taken down to the nasal spine and then the strut graft wa placed  the intradermal suture were then placed using interrupted 50 pd suture to help to provide more tip projection and definition  the intradermal suture were then placed to help to align the nasal tip  the cartilage strut wa then sutured in place to the medial crus after elevating the vestibular skin off the medial crus in the area of the plane suturing  prior to the intradermal suturing the vestibular skin wa also taken off in the area of the domethe columellar strut wa then sutured in place using interrupted 50 pd suture placed in a horizontal mattress fashion with care to help repair the left medial crural foot  the patient had good tip support after this maneuver  we then proceeded to repair the septal deformity created by taking down the dorsal hump with the rubin osteotome  this wa done by crushing the remaining cartilage in the morcellizer and then wrapping this crushed cartilage in endogen which is a radiated collagen  the autogenous cartilage wa wrapped in endogen in a sandwich fashion and then a 40 chromic suture wa placed through this to help with placement of the dorsal onlay graftthe dorsal onlay wa then sewn into position and then the 40 chromic suture wa brought out through this externally to help the superior placement of the dorsal onlay graft  once we were happy with the position of the dorsal onlay graft the graft wa then sutured in place using two interrupted 40 fastabsorbing suture inferiorly just above the superior edge of the lower lateral cartilage  once we were happy with the placement of this we did need to take down some of the bony dorsal hump laterally and this wa done using a 6 and then followed with a 3 push graft  this wrapping wa performed prior to placement of the dorsal onlay grafti went through content with the dorsal onlay graft and the closure of the roof deformity a well a placement of the columellar strut we then felt the patient could use a bit more tip projection and therefore we fashioned a radiated rib into a small octagon and this wa sutured in place over the tip using two interrupted 50 pd suturesat this point we were happy with the test result although the patient did have significant amount of fullness in the dorsal hump area due to soft tissue thick and fullness  there do not appear to be any other pathology causing the patient dorsal hump and therefore we felt we have achieved the best cosmetic result at this point  the septum wa reapproximated using a fastabsorbing 40 suture and a keith needle placed in the mattress fashion  the kelly incision wa closed using two interrupted 40 fastabsorbing gut suture  doyle splint were then placed within the nasal cavity and secured to the inferior septum using a 30 monofilament suture  the columellar skin wa reapproximated using interrupted 60 nylon suture and the marginal incision of the vestibular skin wa closed using interrupted 40 chromic suturesat the end of the procedure all sponge needle and instrument count were correct  a denver external splint wa then applied  the patient wa awakened extubated and transported to anesthesia care unit in good condition ,2.0

the patient wa unable to stand and therefore gait romberg test and balance could not be assesseddiagnostic study  previous diagnostic study and patient report  there were extensive patient report all of which were reviewed  a previous xray study of the lateral chest performed in october 2008 showed poor inspiration with basilar atelectasis and an infiltrate  an xray of the cervical thoracic and lumbar spine showed some evidence of lumbar spinal stenosis  a cta of the neck with and without contrast performed in november 2008 showed minor stenosis in the left carotid a mild hard and soft plaque in the right carotid with approximately 55 stenosis  the posterior circulation showed a slightly dominant right vertebral artery with no stenosis  there wa no significant stenosis but there wa minor extracranial stenosis noted  an mri of the brain with and without contrast performed in november 2008 showed no evidence of an acute infarct major vascular occlusion and no abnormal enhancement with gadolinium administration  there wa also no significant sinusitis or mastoiditis  this wa an essentially normal brain mri  a cbc performed in january 2009 showed an elevated white cell count of 113 a low red cell count of 343 elevated mch of 324 and the rest of the study wa normal  an electrolyte study performed in january 2009 showed a sodium which wa low at 127 a calcium which wa low at 83 and a low protein of 52 and albumin of 31  the glucose wa 86  tsh performed in january 2009 wa 157 which is within the normal range  vitamin b12 wa greater than a 1000 which is normal and the folate wa 182 which wa normal  a myocardial stress study performed in december 2008 showed normal myocardial perfusion with persantine cardiolite spect  the ecg wa nondiagnostic  there wa normal regional wall motion of the left ventricle  the left ventricular ejection fraction wa 68 which is within the normal range for male  a ct of the lumbar spine without contrast performed in december 2008 showed a broadbased disc bulge at l1l2 l2l3 l3l4 and l4l5  at l5s1 in addition to the broadbased disc bulge there wa also an osteophyte complex and evidence of flavum hypertrophy without canal stenosis  there wa severe bilateral neural foraminal stenosis at l5s1 and moderate neural foraminal stenosis at l1l4  an echocardiogram wa performed in november 2008 and showed mild left atrial enlargement normal left ventricular systolic function mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy scleral degenerative change in the aortic and mitral apparatus mild mitral regurgitation mild tricuspid regurgitation and mild to moderate aortic regurgitationdiagnostic impression  the patient present with a severe neuropathy with marked large fiber sensory a well a motor finding  he is diffusely weak a well a atrophic in all muscle group both in his upper and lower extremity although he is disproportionately weak in his lower extremity  his proprioceptive and vibratory loss is severe in both the distal upper and lower extremity signifying that he either ha a severe sensory neuropathy or ha involvement of the dorsal root ganglion  according to the history which wa carefully checked the initial onset of these symptom go back one and a half year although there ha only been significant progression in his condition since july 2008  a indicated below further diagnostic study including a detailed nerve conduction and emg test today showed evidence of a severe sensory motor and axonal neuropathy and in addition there wa evidence of a diffuse polyradiculopathy  there wa no involvement of the tongue on emg  the laboratory testing a indicated below failed to show a specific cause for the neuropathy  we are still however waiting for the paraneoplastic antibody which were send out lab to the mayo clinic  this type of very severe sensorimotor neuropathy with significant proprioceptive loss may be seen in several condition including peripheral nerve vasculitis due to a variety of disorder such a sle sjogrens rheumatoid arthritis and mixed connective tissue disease  in addition it may also be seen with certain toxin particularly chemotherapeutic agent  the patient did not receive any of these  it may also be seen a part of a paraneoplastic syndrome  although the patient doe not have any specific clinical symptom of a cancer it is noted that he ha had an 18pound weight loss in the past month and doe have a remote history of smoking  we have requested that he obtain a ct of his chest abdomen and pelvis while he is in acute rehabilitation  the verbal report of these possibly did not show any evidence of a cancer  we did also request that he obtain a gallium scan to see if there wa any evidence of an unsuspected neoplasm  the patient did undergo a nerve and muscle biopsy this wa a radial nerve and biceps muscle biopsy from the left arm  this showed evidence of severe axonal loss  there wa no evidence of a vasculitis  the vessel did show some mild intimal change that would be consistent with atherosclerosis  there were a few perivascular change however there wa no clear evidence of a necrotizing vasculitis even on multiple section  the muscle biopsy showed severe muscle fiber atrophy with evidence of fiber grouping  again there wa no evidence of inflammation or vasculitis  evaluation so far ha also shown no evidence of an amyloid neuropathy no evidence of a monoclonal gammopathy of sarcoidosis and again there is no past history of a significant toxin or infective cause for the neuropathy  specifically there is no history of hiv exposure  we would await the result of the gallium scan and of the paraneoplastic antibody to see if these are helpful in making a diagnosis  at this point because of the severity and the axonal nature of the neuropathy there is no specific therapy that will reverse the course of the illness unless we find a specific etiology that can be stopped or reversed  i have discussed these issue at length with the patient and with his son  we also addressed whether or not there might be a previously undiagnosed inherited neuropathy  i think this is unlikely given the short history and the rapid progression of the disorderthere is also no family history that we can detect a neuropathy and the patient doe not have the typical phenotype for a chronic inherited neuropathy such a charcotmarietooth disease type 2  however since i have only seen the patient on one occasion and do not know what his previous examination showed two year ago i cannot be certain that there may not have been the presence of a neuropathy preceding thisplan1  nerve conduction and emg will be performed today  the result were indicated above2  the following laboratory study were requested including electrolyte cbc thyroid function test b12 ana creactive protein complement cryoglobulins doublestranded dna antibody folate level hemoglobin a1c immunofixation electrophoresis panca canca protein electrophoresis rheumatoid factor paraneoplastic antibody study requested from the mayo clinic b12  these study showed minor change which included a low sodium level of 129 a previously noted a low creatinine of 074 low calcium of 86 low total protein of 57  the b12 wa greater than 2000  the immunoelectrophoresis ana doublestranded dna anca hemoglobin a1c folate cryoglobulins complement creactive protein were all normal or negative  the b12 level wa greater than 2000  liver function test were normal  the glucose wa 90  esr wa 10  hemoglobin a1c wa 553  a left radial sensory and left biceps biopsy were requested and have been performed and interpreted a indicated above4  ct of chest abdomen and pelvis5  whole body gallium scan for evidence of an underlying neoplasm6  the patient will go to the rehabilitation facility for acute

engulfed the porta hepatis the workup began with gi bleeding he wa seen in my office on 011106 for preop evaluation due to leg edema a nonocclusive dvt wa diagnosed in the proximal left superficial femoral vein both leg were edematous and bilateral venous insufficiency wa also present an echocardiogram demonstrated an ejection fraction of 50 the patient wa admitted to the hospital and treated with a greenfield filter since anticoagulant wa contraindicated additional information on the echocardiogram where a grossly dilated left atrium moderately severely dilated right atrium the rhythm wa a stated before atrial fibrillation with slow atrioventricular conduction and an intraventricular conduction delay on the monitor strip there wa mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation mild pulmonic insufficiency the ejection fraction wa considered low normal since it wa estimated 50 to 54 the patient received blood while in the hospital due to anemia the leg edema improved while lying down suggesting that the significant element of venous insufficiency wa indeed present the patient who wa diabetic received consultation by dr r he wa also a chronic hypertensive and wa treated for that with ace inhibitor the atrial fibrillation wa slow and no digitalis or beta blocker were recommended at the same time a a matter of fact they were discontinued now the patient denied any shortness of

scenario whereby he will become a candidate for management of this arrhythmia beyond weight control he is also not a candidate for anticoagulation which is in essence a part and parcel of the weight control reason being is high likelihood for gi bleeding especially given the diagnosis of invasive malignancy with involvement of multiple organ and lymph node at this point i agree with the notion of hospice care if his atrioventricular conduction becomes excessive occasional nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker such a diltiazem or beta blocker would be appropriate otherwise i would keep him off those medication due to evidence of slow conduction in the presence of digitalis and beta blocker ,1.0

herself npo since mid night for surgery for her painful left bunion  the patient ha had increasing pain over time and is having difficulty ambulating and wearing shoe  the patient ha failed to conservative treatment and desire surgical correction at this time  risk versus benefit of the procedure have been explained in detail by dr x and consent is available on the chart for reviewprocedure in detail  after an iv established by the department of anesthesia the patient wa given preoperatively 600 mg of clindamycin intravenously  the patient wa then taken to the operating suite via cart and wa placed on the operating table in a supine position and a safety strap wa placed across her waist for protection  next a pneumatic ankle tourniquet wa applied over her left ankle with copious amount of webril for the patient protection  after adequate iv sedation wa applied the patient wa given a local injection consisting of 17 cc of 45 cc 1 lidocaine plain 45 cc of 05 marcaine plain and 10 cc of solumedrol mixture in the standard mayo block to the left foot  the foot wa then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion  the foot wa then elevated the esmarch wa applied and the tourniquet wa inflated to 250 mmhg  the foot wa then lowered to the operating fielda sterile stockinet wa reflected and the attention wa directed to the first metatarsophalangeal joint of the left foot  after sufficient anesthesia using a 10 blade a linear incision wa made approximately 5 to 6 cm in length over the first metatarsophalangeal joint dorsally just near to the extensor hallucis longus tendon  then using a fresh 15 blade this incision wa deepened through the skin into the subcutaneous layer after all small traversing vein were ligated and cauterized with electrocautery  a neurovascular bundle wa identified and reflected medially  laterally the extensor hallucis longus tendon wa identified and protected with retraction a well  care wa then taken to undermine the medial and lateral margin of the first metatarsophalangeal joint carefully  the first metatarsophalangeal joint capsule wa then identified and using a 15 blade a linear incision made down to the bone through the joint capsule  the periosteum wa reflected and elevated off of it bone and the metatarsal head a well a the base of the proximal phalanx to a small degree  noted wa a large hypertrophic bone spur on the dorsal medial aspect of the first metatarsal head a well a some small osteophyte along the medial portion of the proximal phalanx  care wa then taken to reflect and dissect the periosteum off of the shaft of the first metatarsal proximally into the proximal portion of the metatarsal close to the first metatarsocuneiform joint  the bone cortex wa noted to be intact and in good condition  following this using a sagittal saw with a 138 blade the attention wa directed to the medial hypertrophic bone of the first metatarsal head  in the sagittal plane with the blade angulated from dorsolateral to proximal medial the medial eminence of bone wa resected  plantarly it wa noted that the tibial sesamoid groove wa intact and the sesamoid apparatus wa intact a well  following this bone cut 045 kwire wa inserted from medial to lateral through the medial portion of the first metatarsal head directed in the dorsal third of the metatarsal head  then using the reese osteotomy guide the guide wa directed from the distal portion of the metatarsal head proximally to the proximal portion of the first metatarsal  a second 045 kwire wa inserted proximally a well  following this using the sagittal saw with the 138 blade a transverse linear osteotomy cut wa made through the first metatarsal from medial to lateral  after reaching the distal a well a the proximal portion of the bone and ensuring that cortex wa cut on both the medial a well a lateral side the reese osteotomy guide wa removed and the dorsal and plantar incision cut were made  this began with the dorsal distal cut which extended from medial to lateral with the dorsal portion of the blade angled proximally about five degree through the dorsal third of the distal first metatarsal  following this attention wa directed proximally and an incision osteotomy cut through the bone wa made directed medially to laterally with the inferior portion of the blade angled distally to transect the cortex of the bone  following this the distal portion of the osteotomy cut wa freely movable and wa able to be translocated medially  the head wa then slit medially several millimeter until it wa noted to be in good position and no chopping wa present in the medullary canal of the bone  following this the bone wa stabilized using a 045 kwire distally a well a proximally directed from dorsal to planar direction  next using the normal ao manner the distal cortex wa drilled from dorsal to plantar with a 20 mm drill bit and then over drilled proximally with the cortex using a 27 mm drill bit  the proximal cortex wa then  and then the drill hole wa measured and it wa determined to be 18 mm in length from dorsal to plantar cortex  then using 27 mm tap the thread hole were placed and using an 18 x 27 mm screw  wa achieved and good apposition of the bone and tightness were achieved  intramedullary sludge wa noted to exit from the osteotomy cut  following this attention wa directed proximally and the 045 kwire wa removed and the hole were predrilled using a 20 mm screw then overdrilled using 27 mm screw and counter sucked  following this the hole were measured found to 20 mm in length and the drill hole wa tapped using a 27 mm tap  following this a 20 mm full threaded screw wa inserted and tightened  good intramedullary sludge wa noted and compression wa achieved  attention wa then directed to the distal screw where it wa once again tightened and found to be in good position with good bite  following this range of motion wa performed on the first metatarsophalangeal joint and some lateral deviation of the hallux wa noted  based on this a lateral release wa performed  the extensor hallucis longus tendon wa identified and wa transected medially and a linear incision wa placed down using a 15 blade into the first interspace  the incision wa then deepened with sharp and blunt dissection and using a curved hemostat the transverse a well a the oblique fiber of the abductor hallucis tendon were identified and transected  care wa taken to perform lateral release around the fibular sesamoid through these suspensory ligament a well a the transverse metatarsal ligament and the collateral ligament  upon completion of this the hallux wa noted to be in a rectus position with good alignment  the area wa then flushed and irrigated with copious amount of sterile saline  after this attention wa directed back to the medial capsule and a medial capsulorrhaphy wa performed and the capsule wa closed using 30 vicryl suture  subcutaneous tissue were closed using 30 and 40 vicryl suture to close in layer  the skin wa then reapproximated and closed using 50 monocryl suture  following this the incision were dressed and bandaged in the normal manner using owen silk 4x4s kling and kerlix a well a coban dressing  the tourniquet wa then dropped with a total tourniquet time of 99 minute at 250 mmhg  the patient followed the procedure and the anesthesia well and vascular status wa intact a noted by immediate hyperemia to digit one through five of the left foot  the patient wa then transferred back to the cart and escorted on the cart to the postanesthesia care unit  following this the patient wa given prescription for vicoprofen total 20 to be taken one every six hour a necessary for moderate to severe pain  the patient wa also given prescription for clindamycin to be taken 300 mg four time a day  the patient wa given surgical shoe and wa placed in a posterior sling  the patient wa given crutch and instructed to use them for ambulation  the patient wa instructed to keep her foot iced and elevated and to remain nonweightbearing over the weekend  the patient will follow up with dr x on tuesday morning at 11o clock in his livonia office  the patient wa concerned about any possible allergic reaction to medication and wa placed on codeine and antibiotic due to that  the patient ha dr x pager and will contact him over this weekend if she ha any problem or complaint or return to emergency department if any difficulty should arise  xrays were taken and the patient wa discharged home upon completion of this ,2.0

permanent analysisfindings  the right middle lobe tumor wa adherent to the anterior chest wall  the adhesion wa taken down and the entire pleural surface along the edge of the adhesion wa sent for pathologic analysis  the final frozen pathology on this entire area returned a negative for tumor  additional chest wall abnormality were biopsied and sent for pathologic analysis and these all returned separately a negative for tumor and only fibrotic tissue  several other biopsy were taken and sent for permanent analysis of the chest wall  all of the biopsy site were additionally marked with hemoclips  the right middle lobe lesion wa accompanied with distal pneumonitis and otherwise no direct involvement of the right upper lobe or right lower lobeestimated blood loss  le than 100 mlcondition of the patient after surgery  stablehistory of procedure  this patient is well known to our service  he wa admitted the night before surgery and given hemodialysis and had close blood sugar monitoring in control  the patient wa subsequently taken to the operating room on april 4 2007 wa given general anesthesia and wa endotracheally intubated without incident  although he had markedly difficult airway the patient had fiberoptic bronchoscopy performed all the way down to the level of the subsegmental bronchus  no abnormality were noted in the entire tracheobronchial tree and based on this the decision wa made to proceed with the surgery  the patient wa kept in the supine position and the singlelumen endotracheal tube wa removed and a doublelumen tube wa placed  following this the patient wa placed into the left lateral decubitus position with the right side up and all pressure point were padded  sterile duraprep preparation on the right chest wa placed  a sterile drape around that wa also placed  the table wa flexed to open up the intercostal space  a second bronchoscopy wa performed to confirm placement of the doublelumen endotracheal tube  marcaine wa infused into all incision area prior to making an incision  the incision for the vat right middle lobectomy included a small 1cm incision for the auscultatory incision approximately 4 cm inferior to the inferior tip of the scapula  the camera port wa in the posterior axillary line in the eighth intercostal space through which a 5mm 30degree scope wa used  third incision wa an anterior port which wa approximately 2 cm inferior to the inframammary crease and the midclavicular line in the anterior sixth intercostal space and the third incision wa a utility port which wa a 4 cm long incision which wa approximately one rib space below the superior pulmonary vein  all of these incision were eventually created during the procedure  the initial incision wa the camera port through which under direct visualization an additional small 5mm port wa created just inferior to the anterior port  these two port were used to identify the chest wall lesion which were initially thought to be metastatic lesion  multiple biopsy of the chest wall lesion were taken and the decision wa made to also insert the auscultatory incision port  through these three incision the initial working of the diagnostic portion of the chest wall lesion wa performed  multiple biopsy were taken of the entire chest wall offer and specimen came back a negative  the right middle lobe wa noted to be adherent to the anterior chest wall  this area wa taken down and the entire pleural surface along this area wa taken down and sent for frozen pathologic analysis  this also returned a negative with only fibrotic tissue and a few lymphocyte within the fibrotic tissue but no tumor cell  based on this the decision wa made to not proceed with chest wall resection and continue with right middle lobectomy  following this the anterior port wa increased in size and the utility port wa made and meticulous dissection from an anterior to posterior direction wa performed  the middle lobe branch of the right superior pulmonary vein wa initially dissected and stapled with vascular load 45mm endogia stapler  following division of the right superior pulmonary vein the right middle lobe bronchus wa easily identified  initially this wa thought to be the main right middle lobe bronchus but in fact it wa the medial branch of the right middle lobe bronchus  this wa encircled and divided with a blue load stapler with a 45mm endogia  following division of this the pulmonary artery wa easily identified  two branch of the pulmonary artery were noted to be going into the right middle lobe  these were individually divided with a vascular load after encircling with a right angle clamp  the vascular staple load completely divided these arterial branch successfully from the main pulmonary artery trunk and following this an additional branch of the bronchus wa noted to be going to the right middle lobe  a fiberoptic bronchoscopy wa performed intraoperatively and confirmed that this wa in fact the lateral branch of the right middle lobe bronchus  this wa divided with a blue load stapler 45 mm endogia  following division of this the minor and major fissure were completed along the edge of the right middle lobe separating the right upper lobe from the right middle lobe a well a the right middle lobe from the right lower lobe  following complete division of the fissure the lobe wa put into an endogia bag and taken out through the utility port  following removal of the right middle lobe a meticulous lymph node dissection sampling wa performed excising the lymph node package in the 4r area a well a the 7 lymph node package  node station 8 or 9 node were easily identified therefore none were taken  the patient wa allowed to ventilate under water on the right lung with no obvious air leaking noted  a 19french blake wa placed into the posterior apical position and a 32french chest tube wa placed in the anteroapical position  following this the patient lung wa allowed to reexpand fully and the patient wa checked for air leaking once again  following this all the port were closed with 20 vicryl suture used for the deeper tissue and 30 vicryl suture wa used to reapproximate the subcutaneous tissue and 40 monocryl suture wa used to close the skin in a running subcuticular fashion  the patient tolerated the procedure well wa extubated in the operating room and taken to the

usual sterile fashion  an esmarch wa applied and a tourniquet wa inflated to 325 mmhg on the left thigh  a longitudinal incision wa made over the anterior portion of the knee and this wa taken down through the subcutaneous tissue to the level of the patella retinaculum  a medial peripatellar arthrotomy wa then made and taken down to the level of the tibial tubercle  care wa then ensured that the patellar tendon wa not violated  the proximal tibia wa then skeletonized both medially and laterally to the level of the axis through the joint line  again care wa ensured that the patellar tendon wa not avulsed from the insertion on the tibia  the intramedullary canal wa then opened using a drill and the anterior sizing guide wa then placed  rongeur wa used to take out any osteophyte and the size of approximately size e at this point the epicondyle axis guide wa then inserted and aligned in a proper orientation  the anterior cutting guide wa then placed  care wa checked for the amount of resection that the femur would be notched and the oscillating saw wa used to cut the anterior portion of the femur  after this wa performed this wa removed and the distal femoral cutting guide wa then placed  the left knee placed in 5 degree of valgus guide wa then placed and a standard distal cut wa then taken  after the cut were ensured further to be leveled and they were and we proceeded to place the finishing guide size e and distal femur  this wa placed slightly in lateral position and secured in position with spring tense and head lift tense  once adequately secured and placed in the appropriate orientation the alignment wa again verified with the epicondyle axis and appeared to be externally rotated appropriately  the chamfer cut and anterior and posterior cut were then made a well a the notch cut using the reciprocating and oscillating saw  after this wa performed the guide wa removed and all bony fragment were then removed  attention wa then directed to the tibia  the external tibial alignment guide wa then placed and pinned to the proximal tibia in a proper position  care wa ensured if it is wa a varus or valgus and the appropriate  the femur gauge wa then used to provide u appropriate amount of bony resection  this wa then pinned and secured into place  ligament retractor were used to protect the collateral ligament and the tip proximal tibial cut wa then made  this bony portion wa then removed and remaining meniscal fragment were removed a well a the acl till adequate exposure wa obtained  trial component were then inserted into position and taken the range of motion and found to have good and full excellent range of motion stability  the trial component were then removed  the tibia wa then stemmed in standard fashion after the tibial plate wa placed in some degree of external rotation with appropriate alignment  after it wa stemmed and broached these were removed and the patella wa then incised a size 41 patella reamer blade wa then used and wa taken down a size 38 patella button wa then placed intact  again the trial component were placed back into position  patella button wa placed and the tracking wa evaluated  they tracked centrally with no touch technique  again all component were now removed and the knee wa then copiously irrigated and suctioned dry  once adequately suctioned dry the tibial portion wa cemented and packed into place  also excess cement wa removed  the femoral component wa then cemented into position  all excess cement wa removed  a size 12 poly wa then inserted in trial to provide compression at cement adhered  the patella wa then cemented and held into place  all component were held under compression until cement had adequately adhered all excess cement wa then removed  the knee wa then taken through range of motion and size 12 felt to be slightly too big this wa removed and the size 10 trial wa replaced and again had excellent varus and valgus stability with full range of motion and felt to be the articulate surface of choice  the knee wa again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry  one last check in the posterior aspect of the knee for any loose bony fragment or osteophyte wa performed there were none found and a final articulating surface wa impacted and locked into place  after this the knee wa taken again for final range of motion and found to have excellent position stability and good alignment of the component  the knee wa once again copiously irrigated and the tourniquet wa deflated  bovie cautery wa used to cauterize the knee bleeding that wa seen until good hemostasis obtained  a drain wa then placed deep to the retinaculum and the retinaculum repair wa performed using 20 ethibond and oversewn with a 1 vicryl  this wa flexed and the repair wa found held

2918,reason for consultation  breast reconstruction post mastectomyhistory of present illness  the patient is a 51yearold lady who had gone many year without a mammogram when she discovered a lump in her right breast early in february of this year  she brought this to the attention of her primary care doctor and she soon underwent ultrasound and mammogram followed by needle biopsy which revealed that there wa breast cancer  this apparently wa positive in two separate location within the suspicious area  she also underwent mri which suggested that there wa significant size to the area involved  her contralateral left breast appeared to be uninvolved  she ha had consultation with dr abc and they are currently in place to perform a right mastectomypast medical history  positive for hypertension which is controlled on medication  she is a nonsmoker and engages in alcohol only moderatelypast surgical history  surgical history includes uterine fibroid some kind of cyst excision on her foot and cataract surgeryallergies  none knownmedications  lipitor ramipril lasix and potassiumphysical examination  on examination the patient is a healthy looking 51yearold lady who is moderately overweight  breast exam reveals significant breast hypertrophy bilaterally with a double d breast size and significant shoulder grooving from her bra strap  there are no any significant scar on the right breast a she ha only undergone needle biopsy at this point  exam also reveals abdomen where there is moderate excessive fat but what i consider a good morphology for a potential tram flapimpression  a 51yearold lady for mastectomy on the right side who is interested in the possibility of breast reconstruction  we discussed the breast reconstruction option in some detail including immediate versus delayed reconstruction and autologous tissue versus implant reconstruction  i think for a lady of this physical size and breast morphology that the likelihood of getting a good result with a tissue expander reconstruction is rather slim  a further complicating factor is the fact that she may well be undergoing radiation after her mastectomy  i would think this would make a simple tissue expander reconstruction virtually beyond the balance of consideration  i have occasionally gotten away with tissue expanders with reasonable result in irradiated patient when they are thinner and smaller breasted but in a heavier lady with large breast i think it virtually deemed to failure  we therefore mostly confine our discussion to the relative merit of tram flap breast reconstruction and latissimus dorsi reconstruction with implant  in either case the contralateral breast reduction would be part of the overall plan the patient understands that the tram flap although not much more lengthy of a procedure is a little comfortable recovery  since we are sacrificing a rectus abdominus muscle that can be more discomfort and difficulty in healing both due to it being a respiratory muscle and to it importance in sitting up and getting out of bed  in any case she doe prefer this option in order to avoid the need for an implant  we discussed pro and con of the surgery including the risk such a infection bleeding scarring hernia or bulging of the donor site seroma of the abdomen and fat necrosis or even the skin slough in the abdomen  we also discussed some of the potential flap complication including partial or complete necrosis of the tram flap itselfplan  the patient is definitely interested in undergoing tram flap reconstruction  at the moment we are planning to do it a an immediate reconstruction at the time of the mastectomy  for this reason i have made arrangement to do initial vascular delay procedure within the next couple of day  we may cancel this if the chance of postoperative irradiation is high  if this is the case i think we can do a better job on the reconstruction if we defer it  the patient understands this and will proceed according to the recommendation from dr abc and from the oncologist ,2.0

after adequate anesthesia wa achieved a curvilinear incision wa made in the right pelvic fossa approximately 9 cm in length extending from the 15 cm medial of the asis down to the suprapubic space  after this wa taken down with a 10 blade electrocautery wa used to take down tissue down to the layer of the subcutaneous fat  camper and scarpas were dissected with electrocautery  hemostasis wa achieved throughout the tissue plain with electrocautery  the external oblique aponeurosis wa identified with musculature and wa entered with electrocautery  then hemostat were entered in and dissection continued down with electrocautery down through the external internal oblique and the transversalis fascia  additionally the rectus sheath wa entered in a linear fashion  after these plane were entered using electrocautery the retroperitoneum wa dissected free from the transversalis fascia using blunt dissection  after the peritoneum and peritoneal structure were moved medially and superiorly by blunt dissection the dissection continued down bluntly throughout the tissue plane removing some alveolar tissue over the right iliac artery  upon entering through the transversalis fascia the epigastric vessel were identified and doubly ligated and tied with 0 silk tie  after the ligation of the epigastric vessel the peritoneum wa bluntly dissected and all peritoneal structure were bluntly dissected to a superior and medial plane  this wa done without any complication and without entering the peritoneum grossly  the round ligament wa identified and doubly ligated at this time with 0 silk tie a well  the dissection continued down now to layer of the alveolar tissue covering the right iliac artery  this alveolar tissue wa cleared using blunt dissection a well a electrocautery  after the external iliac artery wa identified it wa cleared circumferentially all the way around and noted to have good flow and had good arterial texture  the right iliac vein wa then identified and this wa cleared again using electrocautery and blunt dissection  after the right iliac vein wa identified and cleared off all the alveolar tissue it wa circumferentially cleared a well  an additional perforating branch wa noted at the inferior pole of the right iliac vein  this wa tied with a 0 silk tie and secured  hemostasis wa achieved at this time and the tie had adequate control  the dissection continued down and identified all other vital structure in this area  careful preservation of all vital structure wa carried out throughout the dissection  at this time satinsky clamp wa placed over the right iliac vein  this wa then opened using a 11 blade approximately 1 cm in length  the heparinized saline wa placed and irrigated throughout the inside of the vein and the kidney wa pulled into the abdominal field still covered in it protective socking with the superior pole marked  the renal vein wa then elevated and identified in this area  a 50 doubleended prolene stitch wa used to secure the renal vein both superiorly and inferiorly and after appropriately being secured with 50 prolene these were tied down and secured  the renal vein wa then anastomosed to the right iliac vein in a circumferential manner in a running fashion until secured at both superior and inferior pole  the dissection then continued down and the iliac artery wa then anastomosed to the renal artery at this time using a similar method with 50 prolene securing both superior and inferior pole  after such time the 50 prolene wa run around in a circumferential manner until secured in both superior and inferior pole once again  after this wa done and the artery wa secured the satinsky clamp wa removed and a bulldog placed over  the flow wa then opened on the arterial side and then opened on the venous side to allow for proper flow  the bulldog wa then placed back on the renal vein and allowed for the hyperperfusion of the kidney  the kidney pinked up nicely and had a good appearance to it and had appearance of good blood flow  at this time all satinsky clamp were removed and all bulldog clamp were removed  the dissection then continued down to the layer of the bladder at which time the bladder wa identified  appropriate area on the dome the bladder wa identified for entry  this wa entered using electrocautery and approximately 1 cm length after appropriately sizing and incising of the ureter using the metzenbaum scissors in a linear fashion  before this wa done 0 chromic catgut stitch were placed and secured laterally and inferiorly on the dome of the bladder to elevate the area of the bladder and then the bladder wa entered using the electrocautery approximately 1 cm in length  at this time a renal stent wa placed into the ureter and secured superiorly and the stent wa then placed into the bladder and secured a well  subsequently the superior and inferior pole stitch with 50 prolene were used to secure the ureter to the bladder  this wa then run mucosatomucosa in a circumferential manner until secured in both superior and inferior pole once again  good flow wa noted from the ureter at the time of operation  additional vicryl stitch were used to overlay the musculature in a seromuscular stitch over the dome of the bladder and over the ureter itself  at this time an ethibond stitch wa used to make an additional seromuscular closure and rolling of the bladder musculature over the dome and over the anastomosis once again  this wa inspected and noted for proper control  irrigation of the bladder revealed that the bladder wa appropriately filled and there were no flow and no defect  at this time the anastomosis were all inspected hemostasis wa achieved and good closure of the anastomosis wa noted at this time  the kidney wa then placed back into it new position in the right pelvic fossa and the area wa once again inspected for hemostasis which wa achieved  a 10 prolene stitch wa then used for mass closure of the external internal and transversalis fascia and musculature in a running fashion from superior to inferior  this wa secured and knot were dumped  subsequently the area wa then checked and inspected for hemostasis which wa achieved with electrocautery and the skin wa closed with 40 running monocryl  the patient tolerated procedure well without evidence of complication transferred to the dunn icu

scissors and sent for permanent section  we then identified the most inferiordependent portion of the renal pelvis and placed a heel stitch at this for ureteralrenal pelvis anastomosis in a semi running fashion  30 monocryl suture were used to reanastomose the newly spatulated right ureter to the inferior portion of the renal pelvis  next remainder of the pyelotomy wa closed to itself also using 20 monocryl suture  before final stitch were placed a 6x28 ureteral stent wa placed anterograde  this wa accomplished by placing the stent over a guidewire placing the guidewire under direct vision anterograde through the ureter  this wa done until the proximal end wa in the renal pelvis the guidewire wa removed and good proximal curl wa verified by direct vision  then the pyelotomy wa completely closed again with 20 monocryl suture  next attention wa directed at transposition of the crossing renal artery by fixing it with vicryl suture that would impinge le upon the renal pelvis  good pulsation wa verified by direct vision proximal and distal to these pexy suture  next gerotas fascia wa reapproximated and closed with vicryl suture a wa the right peritoneum  hemostasis appeared excellent at this point  there wa no obvious urine extravasation  at this time the procedure wa terminated  the robot wa undocked  under direct visualization all 8 and 12 mm port were closed at the level of the fascia with 0 vicryl suture in an interrupted fashion  then all skin port site were closed with 40 monocryl in a subcuticular fashion and dermabond and bandaids were applied over this  also notably a jacksonpratt drain wa placed in the area of the right kidney and additional right flank stab incision  the patient tolerated the procedure well and no immediate perioperative

inspiratory flow limitation compatible with snoring wa observed during nonrem sleepassessment and plan  this patient present with history of sleep disruption and daytime sleepiness with fatigue  her symptom are multifactorialregarding the etiology of difficulty in initiating and maintaining sleep the patient ha a component of psychophysiologic insomnia based on report of better sleep in the laboratory a compared to home  in addition nontrivial smoking in the home setting may be contributing significantly to sleep disruptionregarding her daytime sleepiness the patient is taking a number of longacting central nervous system acting medication to sedate her and can produce a lasting sedation throughout the daytime  these include trazodone seroquel and methadone  of these medication the methadone is clearly indicative given the history of substance abuse  it would be desirable to reduce or discontinue trazodone and then perhaps consider doing the same with seroquel  i brought this

2262,reason for hospitalization  suspicious calcification upper outer quadrant left breasthistory of present illness  the patient is a 78yearold woman who had undergone routine screening mammography on 060408  that study disclosed the presence of punctate calcification that were felt to be in a cluster distribution in the left breast mound at the 2 oclock position  additional imaging study confirmed the suspicious nature of these calcification  the patient underwent a stereotactic core needle biopsy of the left breast 2 oclock position on 061708  the final histologic diagnosis of the tissue removed during that procedure revealed focal fibrosis  no calcification could be identified in examination of the biopsy material including radiograph taken of the preserved tissuetwo day post stereotactic core needle biopsy however the patient returned to the breast center with severe swelling and pain and mass in the left breast  she underwent sonographic evaluation and wa found to have a development of false aneurysm formation at the site of stereotactic core needle biopsy  i wa called to see the patient in the emergency consultation in the breast center  at the same time dr y wa consulted in interventional radiology  dr z and dr y were able to identify the neck of the false aneurysm in the left breast mound and this wa injected with ultrasound guidance with thrombin material  this resulted in immediate occlusion of the false aneurysm  the patient wa seen in my office for followup appointment on 062408  at that time the patient continued to have sign of a large hematoma and extensive ecchymosis which resulted from the stereotactic core needle biopsy  there wa however no evidence of reforming of the false aneurysm  there wa no evidence of any pulsatile mass in the left breast mound or on the left chest walli discussed the issue with the patient and her husband  the underlying problem is that the suspicious calcification which had been identified on mammography had not been adequately sampled with the stereotactic core needle biopsy therefore the histologic diagnosis is not explanatory of the imaging finding  for this reason the patient wa advised to have an excisional biopsy of this area with guidewire localization  since the breast mound wa significantly disturbed from the stereotactic core needle biopsy the decision wa to postpone any surgical intervention for at least three to four month  the patient now return to undergo the excision of the left breast tissue with preoperative guidewire localization to identify the location of suspicious calcificationsthe patient ha a history of prior stereotactic core needle biopsy of the left breast which wa performed on 012704  this revealed benign histologic finding  the family history is positive

systemmonitoring  sseps and the eps were availableindications  the patient is a 12yearold female who ha had a very dysmorphic scoliosis  she had undergone a workup with an mri which showed no evidence of cord abnormality  therefore the risk benefit and alternative were discussed with surgery with the mother to include infection bleeding nerve injury vascular injury spinal cord injury with catastrophic loss of motor function and bowel and bladder control  i also discussed  and need for revision surgery  the mom understood all this and wished to proceedprocedure  the patient wa taken to the operating room and underwent general anesthetic  she then had line placed and wa then placed in a prone position  monitoring wa then set up and it wa then noted that we could not obtain motorevoked potential  the sseps were clear and were compatible with the preoperative but no preoperative motor had been done and there wa a concern that possibly this could be from the result of the positioning  it wa then determined at that time that we would go ahead and proceed to wake her up and make sure she could move her foot  she wa then lightened under anesthesia and she could indeed dorsiflex and plantarflex her foot so therefore it wa determined to go ahead and proceed with only monitoring with the ssepsthe patient after being prepped and draped sterilely a midline incision wa made and dissection wa carried down  the dissection utilized a combination of hand instrument and electrocautery and dissected out along the lamina and up to the transverse process  this occurred from t2l2  fluoroscopy wa brought in to verify position and level  once this wa done and all bleeding wa controlled retractor were then placed  attention wa then turned towards placing screw first on the left side  lumbar screw were placed at the junction of the transverse process and the facet under fluoroscopic guidance  the area wa opened with a high speed burr and then the track wa defined with a blunt probe and a balltipped feeler wa then utilized to verify all wall were intact  they were then tapped and then screw were then placed  this technique wa used at l1 and l2 both the right and left  at t12 a direct straightahead technique wa utilized where the facet wa removed and then the position wa chosen under the fluoroscopy and then it wa spurred the track wa defined and then probed and tapped and it wa felt to be in good position  two screw in the right and left were placed at t12 a well reduction screw on the left  the same technique wa used for t11 where right and left screw were placed a well a t10 on the left  at t9 a screw wa placed on the left and this wa a reduction screw  on the left at t8 a screw could not be placed due to the dysmorphic nature of the pedicle  it wa not felt to be intact therefore a screw wa left out of this  on the right a thoracic screw wa placed a well a at 7 and 6  this wa the dysmorphic portion of this  screw were attempted to be placed up they could not be placed so attention wa then turned towards placing pedicle hook  pedicle hook were done by first making a box out of the pedicle removing the complete pedicle feeling the undersurface of the pedicle with a probe and then seating the hook  upgoing pedicle hook were placed at t3 t4 and t5  a downgoing laminar hook wa placed at the t7 level  screw had been placed at t6 and t7 on the right  an upgoing pedicle hook wa also placed at t3 on the right and then downgoing laminar hook were placed at t2  this wa done by first using a transverse process lamina finder to go around the transverse process and then  laminar hook  once all hook were in place spinal osteotomy were performed at t7t8 and t8t9  this wa the level of the kyphosis to bring her back out of her kyphoscoliosis  first the ligamentum flavum wa resected using a large kerrisons  next the laminotomy wa performed and then a kerrison wa used to remove the ligamentum flavum at the level of the facet  once this wa accomplished a laminotomy wa performed by removing more of the lamina and to create a small wedge that could be closed down later to correct the kyphosis  this wa then brought out with resection of bone out to the foramen doing a foraminotomy to free up the foramen on both side  this wa done also between the t8t9  once this wa completed gelfoam wa then placed  next we observed and measured and contoured  the rod were then seated on the left and then a derotation maneuver wa performed  hook had come loose so the rod wa removed on the left  the hook were then replaced and the rod wa reseated  again it wa derotated to give excellent correction  hook were then well seated underneath and therefore they were then locked  a second rod wa then chosen on the right and wa measured contoured and then seated  next once this wa done the rod were locked in the midsubstance and then the downgoing pedicle hook which had been placed at t7 wa then helped to compress t8 a wa the pedicle screw and then this compressed the osteotomy site quite nicely  next distraction wa then utilized to further correct at the spine and to correct on the left the left concave curve which gave excellent correction  on the right compression wa used to bring it down and then in the lower lumbar area distraction and compression were used to level out l2  once this wa done all screw were tightened  fluoroscopy wa then brought in to verify l1 wa level and the first rib were also level and it gave a nice balanced spine  everything wa copiously irrigated   next a wakeup test wa performed and the patient wa then noted to flex and extend the knee a well a dorsiflex and plantar flex both the foot  the patient wa then again sedated and brought back under general anesthesia  next a highspeed burr wa used for decortication  after final tightening had been accomplished and then allograft bone and autograft bone were mixed together with 10 ml of iliac crest aspirate and were placed into the wound  the open canal area had been protected with gelfoam  once this wa accomplished the deep fascia wa closed with multiple figureofeight 1 oversewn with a running 1  were then placed in the subcutaneous space which were then closed with 30 vicryl and then the skin wa closed with 30 monocryl and dermabond  sterile dressing wa applied  drain had been placed in the subcutaneous layer x2  the patient

tendonanesthesia  general with an interscalene blockcomplications  noneneedle and sponge count were done and correctindication for operation  the patient is a 26yearold right hand dominant male who work in sale who wa performing heavy bench press exercise when he felt a tearing burning pain severe in his right shoulder  the patient presented with mild bruising over the proximal arm of the right side with xray showing no fracture  over concern for pectoralis tendon tear he wa sent for mri evaluation where a complete rupture of a portion of the pectoralis major tendon wa noted  due to the patient young age and active lifestyle surgical treatment wa recommended in order to obtain best result  the risk and benefit of the procedure were discussed in detail with the patient including but not limited to scarring infection damage to blood vessel and nerve rerupture need further surgery loss of range of motion inability to return to heavy activity such a weight lifting complex usual pain syndrome and deep vein thrombosis a well a anesthetic risk  understanding all risk and benefit the patient desire to proceed with surgery a plannedfindings1  following deltopectoral approach to the right shoulder the pectoralis major tendon wa encountered  the clavicular head wa noted to be intact  there wa noted to be complete rupture of the sternal head of the pectoralis major tendon with an obliquetype tear having some remaining cuff on the humerus and some tendon attached to the retracted portion2  following freeing of adhesion using track and suture the pectoralis major tendon wa able to reapproximated to it insertion site on the humerus just lateral to the biceps3  a soft tissue repair wa performed with 5 fiberwire suture and a single suture anchor of 5 x 5 bioabsorbable anchor wa placed in order to decrease tension at the repair site  following repair of soft tissue and using the bone anchor there wa noted to be good apposition of the tendon with edge and a solid repairoperative report in detail  the patient wa identified in the preop holding area  his right shoulder wa identified marked his appropriate surgical site after verification with the patient  he wa then taken to the operating room where he wa transferred to the operative table in supine position and placed under general anesthesia by anesthesiology team  he then received prophylactic antibiotic  a timeout wa then undertaken verifying the correct patient extremity surgery performed administration of antibiotic and the availability of equipment  at this point the patient wa placed to a modified beech chair position with care taken to ensure all appropriate pressure point were padded and there wa no pressure over the eye  the right upper extremity wa then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion  preoperative marking were still visible at this point  a deltopectoral incision wa made utilizing the inferior portion  dissection wa carried down  the deltoid wa retracted laterally  the clavicular head of the pectoralis major wa noted to be intact with the absence of the sternal insertion  there wa a small cuff of tissue left on the proximal humerus associated with the clavicular head  gentle probing medially revealed the end of the sternal retracted portion traction suture of 5 ethibond were used in this to allow for retraction and freeing from light adhesion  this allowed reapproximation of the retracted tendon to the tendon stump  at this point a repair using 5 fiberwire wa then performed of the pectoralis major tendon back to stump on the proximal humerus noting good apposition of the tendon edge and no gapping of the repair site  at this point a single metal suture anchor wa attempted to be implanted just lateral to the insertion of the pectoralis in order to remove tension off the repair site however the inserted device attached to the metal anchor broke during insertion due to significant hardness of the bone  for this reason the starting hole wa tapped and a 5x5 bioabsorbable anchor wa placed doubly loaded  the suture were then weaved through the lateral aspect of the torn tendon and a modified krackow type performed and sutured thereby relieving tension off the soft tissue repair  at this point there wa noted to be excellent apposition of the soft tissue end and a solid repair to gentle manipulation  aggressive external rotation wa not performed  the wound wa then copiously irrigated  the cephalic vein wa not injured during the case  the skin wa then closed using a 20 vicryl followed by a 30 subcuticular prolene suture with steristrips  sterile dressing wa then placed  anesthesia wa then performed interscalene block  the patient wa then awakened from anesthesia and transported to postanesthesia care in stable condition in a shoulder immobilizer with the arm adducted and internally rotatedplan for this patient the patient will remain in the shoulder immobilizer until followup visit in approximately 10 day  we will then start a gentle codman type exercise and having limited motion until the 46 week point based on the patient progression ,2.0

present illness  the patient is a 52yearold male who is here for independent medical evaluation  the patient state that he work for abc abc a a temporary worker  he worked for abcd too  the patient main job wa loading and unloading furniture and appliance for the home  the patient wa approximately there for about two and a half week  date of injury occurred back in october  the patient stating that he had history of previous back problem ongoing however he state that on this particular day back in october he wa unloading an 18wheeler at abc and he wa bending down picking up box to unload and load  unfortunately at this particular event the patient had sharp pain in his lower back  soon afterwards he had radiating symptom down his right buttock all the way down to the lateral part of his leg crossing his knee  this became progressively worse  he also state that some of his radiating pain went down to his left leg a well  he noticed increase in buttock spasm and also noticed spasm in his buttock  he initially saw dr z and wa provided with some muscle relaxer and wa given some pain patch or lidoderm patch i believe  the patient state that after this treatment his symptom still persisted  at this point the patient later on wa referred to dr xyz through the workman comp and he wa initially evaluated back in april  after the evaluation the patient wa sent for mri wa provided with pain medication such a shortacting opioids  he wa put on restricted duty  the mri essentially came back negative but the patient continued to have radiating symptom down to his lower extremity and subsequently the patient wa essentially released by dr xyz in june with maximum medical improvementunfortunately the patient continued to have persistence of back pain and radiating symptom down to his leg and went back to see dr xyz again and at this point the patient wa provided with further medication management and sent for pain clinic referral  the patient also wa recommended for nerve block at this point and the patient received epidural steroid injection by dr abc without any significant relief  the patient also wa sent for emg and nerve conduction study which wa performed by dr abcd and the mri emg and nerve conduction study came back essentially negative for radiculopathy which wa performed by dr abcd  the patient state that he continues to have pain with extended sitting he ha radiating symptom down to his lower extremity on the right side of his leg increase in pain with stooping  he ha difficulty sleeping at nighttime because of increase in pain  ultimately the patient wa returned back to work in june and deemed with maximum medical improvement back in june  the patient unfortunately still ha significant degree of back pain with activity such a stooping and radicular symptom down his right leg worse than the left side  the patient also went to see dr x who is a chiropractic specialist and received eight or nine visit of chiropractic care without longterm relief in his overall radicular symptomsphysical examination  the patient wa examined with the gown on  lumbar flexion wa moderately decreased  extension wa normal  side bending to the right wa decreased  side bending to the left wa within normal limit  rotation and extension to the right side wa causing increasing pain  extension and side bending to the left wa within normal limit without significant pain on the left side  while seated straight leg wa negative on the lle at 90° and also negative on the rle at 90°  there wa no true root tension sign or radicular symptom upon straight leg raising in the seated position  in supine position straight leg wa negative in the lle and also negative on the rle  sensory exam show there wa a decrease in sensation to the s1 dermatomal distribution on the right side to light touch and at all other dermatomal distribution wa within normal limit  deep tendon reflex at the patella wa 24 bilaterally but there wa a decrease in reflex in the achilles tendon 14 on the right side and essentially 24 on the left side  medial hamstring reflex wa 24 on both hamstring a well  on prone position there wa tightness in the paraspinals and erector spinae muscle a well a tightness on the right side of the quadratus lumborum area right side wa worse than the left side  increase in pain at deep palpatory examination in midline of the l5 and s1 levelmedical record review  i had the opportunity to review dr xyzs medical record  also reviewed dr abc procedural note which wa the epidural steroid injection block that wa performed in december  also reviewed dr x medical record note and an emg and nerve study that wa performed by dr abcd which wa essentially normal  the mri of the lumbar spine that wa performed back in april which showed no evidence of herniated discdiagnosis  residual from low back injury with right lumbar radicular symptomatologyevaluationrecommendation  the patient ha an impairment based on ama guide fifth edition and it is permanent  the patient appears to have reaggravation of the low back injury back in october related to his work at abc when he wa working unloading and loading an 18wheel truck  essentially there wa a clear aggravation of his symptom with ongoing radicular symptom down to his lower extremity mainly on the right side more so than the left  the patient also ha increase in back pain with lumbar flexion and rotational movement to the right side  with these ongoing symptom the patient ha also decrease in activity of daily living such a mobility a well a decrease in sleep pattern and general decrease in overall function  therefore the patient is assigned 8 impairment of the whole person  we are able to assign this utilizing the fifth edition on spine section on the ama guide  using page 384 table 153 the patient doe fall under dre lumbar category ii under criterion for rating impairment due to lumbar spine injury  in this particular section it state that the patient clinical history and examination finding are compatible with specific injury and finding may include significant muscle guarding or spasm observed at the time of examination a symmetric loss of range of motion or nonverifiable radicular complaint define his complaint of radicular pain without objective finding no alteration of the structural integrity and no significant radiculopathy  the patient also ha decrease in activity of daily living therefore the patient is assigned at the higher impairment rating of 8 wpi  in the future the patient should avoid prolonged walking standing stooping squatting hip bending climbing excessive flexion extension and rotation of his back  his one time weight limit should be determined by work trial although the patient should continue to be closely monitored and managed for his pain control by the specific specialist for management of his overall pain  the patient although ha a clear low back pain with certain movement such a stooping and extended sitting and doe have a clear radicular symptomatology the patient also should be monitored closely for specific dependency to shortacting opioids in the near future by specialist who could monitor and closely follow his overall pain management  the patient also should be treated with appropriate modality and appropriate rehabilitation in the near future ,2.0

patient apparently began to complain of chest pain and appeared to the nurse to have mounting exhaustion and respiratory distress although o2 had been placed elevating his oxygen saturation to the mid to upper 90 he continued to complain of symptom a noted above he became progressively more rapidly obtunded the patient did receive one gram of magnesium sulfate shortly after his arrival and the bipap apparatus wa being readied for his use however the patient at this point became unresponsive unable to answer question and preparation were begun for intubation the bipap apparatus wa briefly placed while supply and medication were assembled for intubation it wa noted that even with the bipap apparatus in the duration of time which wa required for transfer of oxygen tubing to the bipap mask the patient’s o2 saturation rapidly dropped to the upper 60 rangeall preparation for intubation having been undertaken succinylcholine wa ordered but wa apparently unavailable in the department a the patient wa quite obtunded and while the dacuronium wa being sought an initial trial of intubation wa carried out using a straight blade and a cupped 79 endotracheal tube however the patient had enough residual muscle tension to make this impractical and further effort were held pending administration of dacuronium 10 mg after approximately two minute another attempt at intubation wa successful the cord were noted to be covered with purulent exudate at the time of intubationthe endotracheal tube having been placed atraumatically the patient wa initially then nebulated on 100 oxygen and his o2 saturation rapidly rose to the 90100 rangechest xray demonstrated proper placement of the tube the patient wa given 1 mg of versed with decrease of his pulse from the 140180 range to the 120 range with satisfactory maintenance of his blood pressurebecause of a complaint of chest pain which i myself did not hear during the patient’s initial triage elevation a trial of tridil wa begun a the patient’s pressure held in the slightly elevated range it wa possible to push this to 30 mcg per minute however after administration of the dacuronium and versed the patient’s blood pressure fell somewhat and this medication wa discontinued when the systolic pressure briefly reached 98because of concern regarding pneumonia or sepsis the patient received one gram of rocephin

done  open radical retropubic prostatectomy with bilateral lymph node dissectionindications  this is a 66yearold gentleman who had an elevated psa of 5  his previous psa were in the 1 range  trus biopsy revealed 43 gleason score prostate cancer with a large tumor burden  after extensive counseling the patient elected for retropubic radical prostatectomy  given his disease burden it wa advised that an open prostatectomy is probably the standard of care to ensure entire excision  the patient consented and agreed to proceed forwarddescription of procedure  the patient wa brought to the operating room here  time out wa taken to properly identify the patient and procedure going to be done  general anesthesia wa induced  the patient wa placed in the supine position  the bed wa flexed distant to the pubic area  the patient lower abdominal area pubic area and penile and scrotal area were clipped and then scrubbed with hibiclens soap for three minute  the patient wa then prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion  foley catheter wa inserted sterilely in the field  preoperative antibiotic were given within 30 minute of skin incision  a 10 cm lower abdominal incision wa made from the symphysis pubis towards the umbilicus  dissection wa taken down through scarpas fascia to the level of the anterior rectus sheath  the rectus sheath wa then incised and the muscle wa split in the middle  space of rectus sheath wa then entered  the bookwalter ring wa then applied to the belly and the bladder wa then retracted to the right side thus exposing the left obturator area  the lymph node packet on the left side wa then dissected  this wa done in a split and roll fashion with the flimsy tissue and the left external iliac vein wa incised and the tissue were then rolled over the left external iliac vein  dissection wa carried down from the left external iliac vein to the obturator nerve and up to the level of the pelvic sidewall  the proximal extent of dissection wa the left hypogastric artery to the level of the node of cloquet distally  care wa taken to avoid injury to the nerve  an accessory obturator vein wa noted and wa ligated  the same procedure wa done on the right side with dissection of the right obturator lymph node packet which wa sent for pathologic evaluation  the bladder subsequently wa retracted cephalad  the prostate wa then defatted up to the level of the endopelvic fascia  the endopelvic fascia wa then incised bilaterally and the incision wa then taken to the level of the puboprostatic ligament  vicryl stitch wa then applied at the level of the bladder neck in order to control the bladder back bleeder  a babcock wa then applied around the dorsal venous complex over the urethra and the kwire wa then passed between the dorsal vein complex and the urethra by passing by the aid of a right angle  a 0vicryl stitch wa then applied over the dorsal venous complex which wa then tied down and cinched to the symphysis pubis  using a knife on a long handle the dorsal venous complex wa then incised using the kwire a a guide  following the incision of the dorsal venous complex the anterior urethra wa then incised thus exposing the foley catheter  the 30 monocryl suture were then applied going outside in on the anterior aspect of the urethra  the lateral edge of the urethra were also then incised and two lateral stitch were also applied going outside end  the catheter wa then drawn back at the level of membranous urethra and a final posterior stitch wa applied going outside end  the urethra wa subsequently divided in it entirety  a foley catheter wa then taken out and wa inserted directly into the bladder through the prostatic apex  the prostate wa then entered cephalad and the prostatic pedicle were then systematically taken down with the right angle clip and cut  please note that throughout the case the patient wa noted to have significant oozing and bleeding partially from the dorsal venous complex pelvic vein and extensive vascularity that wa noted in the patient pelvic fatty tissue  throughout the case the bleeding wa controlled with the aid of a clip vicryl suture silk suture and tie direct pressure packing and floseal  following the excision of the prostatic pedicle the posterior dissection at this point wa almost complete  please note that the dissection wa relatively technically challenging due to extensive adhesion between the prostate and denonvilliers fascia  the seminal vesicle on the left side wa dissected in it entirety however the seminal vesicle on the right side wa adherently stuck to the denonvilliers fascia which prompted the excision of most of the right seminal vesicle with the exception of the tip  care wa taken throughout the posterior dissection to preserve the integrity of the ureter  the anterior bladder neck wa then cut anteriorly and the bladder neck wa separated from the prostate  following the dissection the 5french feeding tube were inserted bilaterally into the ureter thus insuring their integrity  following the dissection of the bladder from the prostate the prostate at this point wa mobile and wa sent for pathological evaluation  the bladder neck wa then repaired using vicryl in a tennis racquet fashion  the rest of the mucosa wa then everted  the ureteral orifice and ureter were protected throughout the procedure  at this point the initial suture that were applied into the urethra were then applied into the corresponding position on the bladder neck and the bladder neck wa then cinched down and tied down after a new foley catheter wa inserted through the penile meatus and into the bladder pulling the bladder in position  hemostasis wa then adequately obtained  floseal wa applied to the pelvis  the bladder wa then irrigated  it wa draining pink urine  the wound wa copiously irrigated  the fascia wa then closed using a 1 looped pd  the skin wound wa then irrigated and the skin wa closed with a 40 monocryl in subcuticular fashion  at this point the procedure wa terminated with no complication  the patient wa then extubated in the operating room and taken in stable condition to the pacu  please note that during the case about 3600 ml of blood wa noted  this wa due to the persistent continuous oozing from vascular fatty tissue and pelvic vein a previously noted in the dictation ,2.0

appropriate volume and pressure  a 10 mm step trocar wa then inserted through this site and intraabdominal placing wa confirmed with the laparoscope  on entrance into the patient abdomen and pelvis survey of the abdomen and pelvis revealed the operative area to be relatively free of adhesion except for the right pelvic saddle in which there were filmy adhesion  there wa also white exudate noted covering the surface of the uterus and adnexa and the uterus had a quite boggy appearance  at this time under transillumination in the left anterior axillary line a second incision wa made with a

superficial nerve and vessel a necessary  the capsular incision following the same outline a the skin incision wa made and carried down to the underlying bony structure  the capsule wa then freed from the underling bony structure utilizing sharp and blunt dissection  using a microsagittal saw the medial and dorsal very prominent bony eminence were removed and the area wa inspected for any remaining bony prominence following resection of bone and those noted were removed using a hand rasp  at this time attention wa directed to the first inner space using sharp and blunt dissection  dissection wa carried down to the underling level of the adductor hallucis tendon which wa isolated and freed from it phalangeal sesamoidal and metatarsal attachment  the tendon wa noted to lap the length and integrity for transfer and at this time wa tenotomized taking out resection of approximately 05 cm to help prevent any refibrous attachment  at this time the lateral release wa stressed and wa found to be complete  the extensor hallucis brevis tendon wa then isolated using blunt dissection and wa tenotomized a well taking out approximately 05cm resection  the entire area wa copiously flushed 3 time using a sterile saline solution and wa inspected for any bony prominence remaining and it wa noted that the base of the proximal phalanx on the medial side due to the removal of the extensive buildup of the metatarsal head wa going to be very prominent in nature and at this time wa removed using a microsagittal saw  the area wa again copiously flushed and inspected for any abnormality andor prominence and none were noted  at this time attention wa directed to the base of the first metatarsal where a second incision wa made approximately 4 cm in length  the incision wa deepened within the same plain taking care of bovie and retracted all superficial nerve and vessel a necessary  the incision wa then carried down to the level of the metatarsal and using sharp and blunt dissection periosteal capsule structure were freed from the base of the metatarsal and taking care to retract the long extensive tendon and any neurovascular structure to avoid any disruption  at this time there wa a measurement made of 1 cm just distal to the metatarsocuneiform joint on the medial side and 2 cm distal to the metatarsocuneiform joint from the lateral aspect of the joint  at this time 05 cm wa measured distal to that lateral measurement and using microsagittal saw a wedge osteotomy wa taken from the base with the apex of the osteotomy being medial taking care to keep the medial cortex intact a a hinge  the osteotomy site wa feathered down until the osteotomy site could be closed with little tension on it and at this time using an orthopro screw 30 x 22 mm  the screw wa placed following proper technique  the osteotomy site wa found to be fixated with absolutely no movement and good stability upon manual testing  a very tiny gap on the lateral aspect of the osteotomy site wa found and this wa filled in packing it with the cancellous bone that wa left over from the wedge osteotomy  the packing of the cancellous bone wa held in place with bone wax  the entire area wa copiously flushed 3 time using a sterile saline solution and wa inspected and tested again for any movement of the osteotomy site or any gapping and then removed  at this time a deep closure wa achieved utilizing 20 vicryl suture subcuticular closure wa achieved using 40 vicryl suture and skin repair wa achieved at both surgical site with 50 nylon suture in a running interlocking fashion  the hallux wa found to have excellent movement upon completion of the osteotomy and the second procedure of the mcbride bunionectomy and the metatarsal wa found to stay in excellent alignment with good stability at the proximal osteotomy site  at this time the surgical site wa postoperatively injected with 05 marcaine plain a well a dexamethasone 4 mg primarily  the surgical site were then

left hip fracture and she will require surgery  telemetry now reviewed show predominantly normal sinus rhythm with frequent apc  earlier yesterday evening showed burst of multifocal atrial tachycardia and i suspect that wa exacerbated by prior hypokalemia which ha been corrected  there ha been no atrial fibrillation documented  i do not feel these troponins are significant given the stress or fall in prior multifocal atrial tachycardia with increased rate especially in the absence of chest pain or shortness of breath  she actually describes feeling good exercise capacity prior to this fall  given favorable risk to benefit ratio for needed left hip surgery i feel she may proceed with needed left hip surgery from a cardiac standpoint with continued verapamil which ha been started which should help control the multifocal atrial tachycardia which she had and would watch for heart rate with that  continued optimization of electrolyte  the patient cannot take betablockers a previously toprol reportedly caused shortness of breath although there wa some report that it caused bradycardia so we would watch her heart rate on the verapamil  the patient is aware of the cardiac risk certainly it is moderate and wish to proceed with needed surgery  i do not feel any further cardiac evaluation is needed at this time and the patient may followup with dr x after discharge  regarding her mild thrombocytopenia i would defer that to hospitalist and continue proton pump inhibitor for history of gastroesophageal reflux disease management of left hip fracture a per orthopedist ,1.0

postradical prostatectomy and postradiation therapy to the pelvis indiana pouch continent cutaneous diversion and omental pedicle flap to the pelvisanesthesia  general endotracheal with epiduralindications  this patient is a 65yearold white male who in 1998 had a radical prostatectomy  he wa initially dry without pad and then underwent salvage radiation therapy for rising psa  after that he began with episode of incontinence a well a urinary retention requiring catheterization  one year ago he wa unable to catheterize and wa taken to the operative room and had cystoscopy  he had retained staple removed and a diverticulum identified  there were also bladder stone that were lasered and removed and he had been incontinent ever since that time  he wear 8 to 10 pad per day and this ha affected his quality of life significantly  i took him to the operating room on january 16 2008 and found diffuse radiation change with a small capacity bladder and wideopen bladder neck  we both felt that his lower urinary tract wa not rehabilitatable and that a continent cutaneous diversion would solve the number of problem facing him  i felt like if we could remove the bladder safely then this would also provide a benefitfindings  at exploration there were no gross lesion of the smaller or large bowel  the bladder wa predictably sucked into the pelvic sidewall both inferiorly and laterally  the opened bladder which we were able to remove completely had a wideopen capacious diverticulum in it very distal segment  because of the previous radiation therapy and a dissection down to the pelvis i elected to place an omental pedicle flap to provide additional blood supply for healing a well in the pelvis and also under the pubic bone which wa exposed inferiorly due to previous surgery and treatmentprocedure in detail  the patient wa brought to the operative suite and after adequate general endotracheal and epidural anesthesia obtained placed in the supine position flexed over the anterosuperior iliac spine and his abdomen and genitalia were sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion  a nasogastric tube wa placed a well a radial arterial line  he wa given intravenous antibiotic for prophylaxis  a generous midline skin incision wa made from the midepigastrium down to the symphysis pubis deep into the rectus fascia the rectus muscle separated in the midline and exploration carried out with the finding described  moist wound towel and a bookwalter retractor were placed for exposure  we began by retracting the bowel by mobilizing the cecum and ascending colon and hepatic flexure and elevating the terminal ileum up to the second and third portion of the duodenum  the ureter wa identified a a crisis over the iliac vessel and dissected deep into pelvis and subsequently divided between clip  an identical procedure wa performed in the left side with similar finding and the bowel were packed cephaladwe began then dissecting the bladder away from the pelvic side wall staying medial to both epigastric artery  this wa quite challenging because of the previous radiation therapy and radical prostatectomy  we essentially carved the bladder off of the pelvic sidewall inferiorly a best we could and then we were able to have enough freedom to identify the lateral pedicle and these were taken between double clip approximately and clipped distally  we then approached thing posteriorly and carefully dissected between the  and posterior bladder  there wa some remnant seminal vesicle on the right a well a both remnant ejaculatory duct and we used this to dissect the longus safe plane anterior to the rectum  we then entered the bladder anteriorly a distal a we could and remove the bladder and what we thought wa a bladder neck and this appeared to end in a diverticulum  we then peeled it off the remaining rectum and passed the specimen off the operative field  bladder wa irrigated with warm sterile water and a meticulous inspection wa made for hemostasiswe then completely mobilized the omentum off of the proximal transverse colon  this allowed a generous flap to be able to be laid into the pelvis without tensionwe then turned our attention to forming the indiana pouch  i completed the dissection of the right hepatic flexure and the proximal transverse colon and mobilized the omentum off of this portion of the colon  the colon wa divided proximal to the middle colic using a gia80 stapler  i then divided the avascular plane of treves along the terminal ileum and selected a point approximately 15 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve to divide the ileum  the mesentery wa then sealed with a ligasure device and divided and the bowel wa divided with a gia60 stapler  we then performed a sidetoside ileotransverse colostomy using a gia80 stapler closing the open end with a ta 60  the angle were reinforced with silk suture and the mesenteric closed with interrupted silk sutureswe then removed the staple line along the terminal ileum passed a 12french robinson catheter into the cecal segment and plicated the ileum with 3 firing of the gia60 stapler  the ileocecal valve wa then reinforced with interrupted 30 silk suture a described by rowland et al and following this passage of an 18french robinson catheter wa associated with the characteristic pop indicating that we had adequately plicated the ileocecal valveas the patient had had a previous appendectomy we made an opening in the cecum in the area of the previous appendectomy  we then removed the distal staple line along the transverse colon and aligned the cecal end and the distal middle colic end with two 30 vicryl suture  the bowel segment wa then folded over on itself and the reservoir formed with 3 successive application of the sgia polysorb75  between the staple line vicryl suture were placed and the defect closed with 30 vicryl suture ligatureswe then turned our attention to forming the ileocolonic anastomosis  the left ureter wa mobilized and brought underneath the sigmoid mesentery and brought through the mesentery of the terminal ileum and an endtoside anastomosis performed with an open technique using interrupted 40 vicryl suture and this wa stented with a cook 84french ureteral stent and this wa secured to the bowel lumen with a 50 chromic suture  the right ureter wa brought underneath the pouch and placed in a stented fashion with an identical anastomosis  we then brought the stent out through a separate incision cephalad in the pouch and they were secured with a 20 chromic suture  a 24french malecot catheter wa placed through the cecum and secured with a chromic suture  the staple line were then buried with a running 30 vicryl twolayer suture and the open end of the pouch closed with a ta 60 polysorb suture  the pouch wa filled to 240 cc and noted to be watertight and the ureteral anastomosis were intactwe then made a final inspection for hemostasis  the cecostomy tube wa then brought out to the right lower quadrant and secured to the skin with silk suture  we then matured our stoma through the umbilicus  we removed the plug of skin through the umbilicus and delivered the ileal segment through this  a portion of the ileum wa removed and healthy wellvascularized tissue wa matured with interrupted 30 chromic suture  we left an 18french robinson through the stomag and secured this to the skin with silk suture  the malecot and stent were also secured in a similar fashionwe matured the stoma to the umbilicus with interrupted chromic stitch  the stitch wa brought out to the right upper quadrant and the malecot to the left lower quadrant  a large jp drain wa placed in the pelvis dependent to the omentum pedicle flap a well a the indiana pouchthe rectus fascia wa closed with a buried 2 prolene running stitch tying a new figureofeight proximally and distally and meeting in the middle and tying it underneath the fascia  subcutaneous tissue wa irrigated with saline and skin wa closed with surgical clip  the estimated blood loss wa 450 ml and the patient received no packed red blood cell  the final sponge and needle count were reported to be correct  the patient wa awakened

severe shortness of breath  the patient received 3 nebulizer at home without much improvement  he wa subsequently treated successfully with supplemental oxygen provided by normal nasal cannula initially and subsequently changed to bipaphospital course  the patient wa admitted to the hospitalist service treated with frequent small volume nebulizer treated with iv solumedrol and bipap support for copd exacerbation  the patient also noted with poorly controlled atrial fibrillation with a rate in the low 100 to mid 100  the patient subsequently received diltiazem also received po digoxin  the patient subsequently responded well a well received iv antibiotic including levaquin and zosyn  the patient made slow but steady improvement over the course of his hospitalization  the patient subsequently wa able to be weaned off bipap during the day but continued bipap at night and will continue with bipap if needed  the patient may require a sleep study after discharge but by the third

1958,reason for visit  the patient is an 84yearold man who return for revaluation of possible idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus  he is accompanied by his wife and daughterhistory of present illness  i first saw him nearly a year ago on december 20 2007  at that time he had had a traumatic deterioration over the course of approximately eight month  this included severe cognitive impairment gait impairment and incontinence  he had actually been evaluated at hospital with csf drainage via a temporary spinal catheter but there wa no response that wa noted  when i saw him there were finding consistent with cervical stenosis and i ordered an mri scan of the cervical spine  i subsequently referred him to dr x who performed a cervical laminectomy and instrumented fusion on july 16 2008  according to his note this went wellaccording to the family there ha not been any improvementwith regard to the gait and balance they actually think that he is worse now than he wa a year ago  he is virtually unable to walk at all  he need both a walker and support from an assistant to be able to stand or walk  therefore he is always in the wheelchairhe is completely incontinent  he never indicates his need to the go to the bathroom  on the other hand when asked he will indicate that he need to go  he wear a depends undergarment all the timehe ha no headacheshis thinking and memory are worse  for the most part he is apathetic  he doe not talk very much  he life in a skilled nursing facility in the alzheimers section  he doe have some daytime activity  he take a nap once a day  he doe not read very much  on the other hand he did recently exercise the right to vote in the presidential election  he need full assistance at the nursing homemedications  from the list by the nursing

minimental state exam score wa 1430  he wa not at all oriented  he did know we were at sinai hospital on the second floor  he could spell world forward but wa mute when asked to spell backwards  he wa mute when asked to recall 33 object for delayed recall  he could not copy a diagram of intersecting pentagon  for comparison the minimental state exam score last december wa 2030 when attention wa tested by having him spell world backwards and 2830 when tested with serial 7 subtraction  additionally there are time when he stutter or stammer  i do not see any paraphasic error  there is some evidence of ideomotor apraxia  he is also stimulus bound  there is a tendency to mimiccranial nerve exam  there is no upgaze that i can elicit today  the horizontal gaze and down gaze are intact  this is a change from a year ago  the muscle of facial expiration are intact a are hearing head turning cough tongue and palate movementmotor exam  normal bulk and strength  the tone is characterized by paratonia  there is no atrophy fasciculation drift or tremorsensory exam  intact to light touchcerebellar exam  intact for fingertonose testing that he can perform only by mimicking but not by following verbal commandsgait  severely impaired  when in the wheelchair he lean to one side  he cannot getup on his own  he need assistance  once up he can bear weight but cannot maintain his balance  this would amount to a tinetti score of zeroreview of xrays  i personally reviewed the ct scan of the brain from november 1 2008 and compared it to the mri scan from a year ago  the ventricle appear larger to me now in comparison to a year ago  the frontal horn span is now 6 cm whereas previously it wa about 55 cm  the 3rd ventricular span is about 15 mm  there is no obvious atrophy although there may be some subtle bilateral perisylvian atrophy  the scan from a year ago showed that there wa a patent sylvian aqueductassessment  the patient ha had worsening of his gait his dementia and his incontinence  the new finding for me today is the limited upgaze  this would be consistent either with progressive supranuclear palsy which wa one of the differential diagnosis a year ago or it could be consistent with progressive enlargement of the ventriclesproblemsdiagnoses1  question of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus 33152  possible supranuclear palsy3  severe gait impairment4  urinary urgency and incontinence5  dementiaplan  i had a long talk with him and his family  even though he ha already had a trial of csf drainage via spinal catheter at hospital over a year ago i offered this test to them again  i do so on the basis that there is further enlargement of the ventricle on the scan  his family and i discussed the fact that it is not likely to be only hydrocephalus  instead we are trying to answer the question of whether hydrocephalus is contributing sufficiently to his symptom that progressing with shunt surgery would make a difference  i have advised them to think it over for a day and contact my office to see whether they would wish to proceed  i gave them a printed prescription of the protocol including it rationale risk benefit and alternative  i specifically mentioned the 3 chance of infection which mean a 97 chance of no infection ,1.0

syndrome and deep vein thrombosis a well a anesthetic risk  understanding all risk and benefit the patient desire to proceed with surgery a plannedfindings1  following deltopectoral approach to the right shoulder the pectoralis major tendon wa encountered  the clavicular head wa noted to be intact  there wa noted to be complete rupture of the sternal head of the pectoralis major tendon with an obliquetype tear having some remaining cuff on the humerus and some tendon attached to the retracted portion2  following freeing of adhesion using track and suture the pectoralis major tendon wa able to reapproximated to it insertion site on the humerus just lateral to the biceps3  a soft tissue repair wa performed with 5 fiberwire suture and a single suture anchor of 5 x 5 bioabsorbable anchor wa placed in order to decrease tension at the repair site  following repair of soft tissue and using the bone anchor there wa noted to be good apposition of the tendon with edge and a solid repairoperative report in detail  the patient wa identified in the preop holding area  his right shoulder wa identified marked his appropriate surgical site after verification with the patient  he wa then taken to the operating room where he wa transferred to the operative table in supine position and placed under general anesthesia by anesthesiology team  he then received prophylactic antibiotic  a timeout wa then undertaken verifying the correct patient extremity surgery performed administration of antibiotic and the availability of equipment  at this point the patient wa placed to a modified beech chair position with care taken to ensure all appropriate pressure point were padded and there wa no pressure over the eye  the right upper extremity wa then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion  preoperative marking were still visible at this point  a deltopectoral incision wa made utilizing the inferior portion  dissection wa carried down  the deltoid wa retracted laterally  the clavicular head of the pectoralis major wa noted to be intact with the absence of the sternal insertion  there wa a small cuff of tissue left on the proximal humerus associated with the clavicular head  gentle probing medially revealed the end of the sternal retracted portion traction suture of 5 ethibond were used in this to allow for retraction and freeing from light adhesion  this allowed reapproximation of the retracted tendon to the tendon stump  at this point a repair using 5 fiberwire wa then performed of the pectoralis major tendon back to stump on the proximal humerus noting good apposition of the tendon edge and no gapping of the repair site  at this point a single metal suture anchor wa attempted to be implanted just lateral to the insertion of the pectoralis in order to remove tension off the repair site however the inserted device attached to the metal anchor broke during insertion due to significant hardness of the bone  for this reason the starting hole wa tapped and a 5x5 bioabsorbable anchor wa placed doubly loaded  the suture were then weaved through the lateral aspect of the torn tendon and a modified krackow type performed and sutured thereby relieving tension off the soft tissue repair  at this point there wa noted to be excellent apposition of the soft tissue end and a solid repair to gentle manipulation  aggressive external rotation wa not performed  the wound wa then copiously irrigated  the cephalic vein wa not injured during the case  the skin wa then closed using a 20 vicryl followed by a 30 subcuticular prolene suture with

proctocolitisacute hiv seroconversion  this subject is sexually active and report inconsistent condom use  gastrointestinal symptom have recently been reported commonly in patient with a history of hiv seroconversion  the rectal symptom of bleeding and pain are not common with hiv and an alternative diagnosis would be requiredperirectal abscess  a patient with a history of receptive anal intercourse is at risk for developing a perirectal abscess either from trauma or a concurrent std  the patient could experience more systemic symptom with fever and malaise a found with this patient  however the physical examination did not reveal the typical localized area of pain and edemadiagnosis  the subject had rectal culture obtained which were positive for neisseria gonorrhoeae  an hiv elisa wa positive a wa the rna pcrdiscussion  this patient demonstrates a number of key issue to consider when caring for an adolescent or young adult  first the patient utilized the emergency department for care a opposed to identifying a primary care provider  although not ideal in many circumstance testing for hiv infection is crucial when there is suspicion since many newly diagnosed patient identify earlier contact with health care provider when hiv counseling and testing were not performed  second this young man ha had both male and female sexual partner  a young people explore their sexuality asking about partner in an open nonjudgmental manner without applying label is integral to helping the young person discus their sexual behavior  assuming heterosexuality is a major barrier to disclosure for many young people who have samesex attraction  third screening for std must take into account sexual behavior  although urinebased screening ha expanded testing of young people it miss anal and pharyngeal infection  if a young person is only having receptive oral or anal intercourse urine screening is insufficient to rule out std  fourth this young man had both localized and systemic symptom  a his anal symptom were most suggestive of a current std performing an hiv test should be part of the standard evaluation  in addition a acute infection is on the differential diagnosis pcr testing should also be considered  the care provided to this young man included the following  he wa treated presumptively for proctitis with both im ceftriaxone a well a oral doxycycline to treat n gonorrhoeae and c trachomatis  ceftriaxone wa chosen due to the recent report of resistant n gonorrhoeae  at the time of the diagnosis the young man wa given the opportunity to meet with the case manager from the adolescentspecific hiv program  the case manager linked this young man directly to care after providing brief counseling and support  the case manager maintained contact with the young man until his first clinical visit four day later  over the subsequent three month the young man had two set of laboratory testing to stage his hiv

dorsal hump which wa both bony and cartilaginous in nature2  the patient had marked hypertrophy of his nasalis muscle bilaterally contributing to the soft tissue dorsal hump3  the patient had a cshaped deformity to the left before he had tip ptosisindications for procedure  the patient is a 22yearold hispanic male who is status post blunt trauma to the nose approximately 9 month with the second episode 2 week following and suffered a marked dorsal deformity  the patient wa evaluated but did not complain of nasal obstruction and his main complaint wa his cosmetic deformity  he wa found to have a cshaped deformity to the left a well a some tip ptosis  the patient wa recommended to undergo an open septorhinoplasty to repair of this cosmetic defectoperation in detail  after obtaining a full consent from the patient identified the patient prepped with betadine brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position on the operating table  the appropriate esmarch wa placed and after adequate sedation the patient wa subsequently intubated without difficulty  the endotracheal tube wa then secured and the table wa then turned clockwise to 90 degree  three afrinsoaked cottonoids were then placed in nasal cavity bilaterally  the septum wa then injected with 3 ml of 1 lidocaine with 1100000 epinephrine in the subperichondrial plane bilaterally  then 50 additional ml of 1 lidocaine with 1100000 epinephrine wa then injected into the nose in preparation for an open rhinoplastyprocedure wa begun by first marking a columellar incision  this incision wa made using a 15 blade  a lateral transfixion incision wa then made bilaterally using a 15 blade and then the columellar incision wa completed using iris scissors with care not to injure the medial crus  however there wa a dissection injury to the left medial crus  dissection wa then taken in the subperichondrial plane over the lower lateral cartilage and then on to the upper lateral cartilage  once we reached the nasal bone a freer wa used to elevate the tissue overlying the nasal bone in a subperiosteal fashion  once we had completed exposure of the bony cartilaginous structure we appreciated a very large dorsal hump which wa made up of both a cartilaginous and bony portion  there wa also an obvious fracture of the right upper lateral cartilage  there wa also marked hypertrophy what appeared to be in the nasalis muscle in the area of the dorsal hump  the skin wa contributing to the patient cosmetic deformity  in addition we noted what appeared to be a small mucocele coming from the area of the fractured cartilage on the right upper lateral cartilage  this mucocele wa attempted to be dissected free most of which wa removed via dissection  we then proceeded to remove takedown of the dorsal hump using a rubin osteotome  the dorsal hump wa taken down and passed off the table  examination of the specimen revealed the marking amount of scar tissue at the junction of the bone and cartilage  this wa passed off to use later for possible onlay graft  there wa now a marked open roof deformity of the cartilage and bony sprue  a septoplasty wa then performed throughout and a kelly incision on the right side  subperichondrial plane were elevated on the right side and then a cartilage wa incised using a caudal and subperichondrial plane elevated on the left side  a 2 x 3cm piece of the cardinal cartilage wa then removed with care to leave at least 1 cm dorsal and caudal septal strut  this cartilage wa passed down the table and then 2 columellar strut graft measuring approximately 15 mm in length were then used and placed to close the bony and cartilaginous open roof deformity  the spreader graft were sewn in place using three interrupted 50 pd suture placed in the horizontal fashion bilaterally  once these were placed we then proceeded to work on the bony open roof  lateral osteotomy were made with 2mm osteotomes bilaterally  the nasal bone were then fashioned medially to close the open roof deformity and this reduced the width of the bony nasal dorsum  we then proceeded to the tip  a cartilaginous strut wa then fashioned from the cartilaginous septum  it wa approximately 15 mm long  this wa placed and a pocket wa just formed between the medial crus  this pocket wa taken down to the nasal spine and then the strut graft wa placed  the intradermal suture were then placed using interrupted 50 pd suture to help to provide more tip projection and definition  the intradermal suture were then placed to help to align the nasal tip  the cartilage strut wa then sutured in place to the medial crus after elevating the vestibular skin off the medial crus in the area of the plane suturing  prior to the intradermal suturing the vestibular skin wa also taken off in the area of the domethe columellar strut wa then sutured in place using interrupted 50 pd suture placed in a horizontal mattress fashion with care to help repair the left medial crural foot  the patient had good tip support after this maneuver  we then proceeded to repair the septal deformity created by taking down the dorsal hump with the rubin osteotome  this wa done by crushing the remaining cartilage in the morcellizer and then wrapping this crushed cartilage in endogen which is a radiated collagen  the autogenous cartilage wa wrapped in endogen in a sandwich fashion and then a 40 chromic suture wa placed through this to help with placement of the dorsal onlay graftthe dorsal onlay wa then sewn into position and then the 40 chromic suture wa brought out through this externally to help the superior placement of the dorsal onlay graft  once we were happy with the position of the dorsal onlay graft the graft wa then sutured in place using two interrupted 40 fastabsorbing suture inferiorly just above the superior edge of the lower lateral cartilage  once we were happy with the placement of this we did need to take down some of the bony dorsal hump laterally and this wa done using a 6 and then followed with a 3 push graft  this wrapping wa performed prior to placement of the dorsal onlay grafti went through content with the dorsal onlay graft and the closure of the roof deformity a well a placement of the columellar strut we then felt the patient could use a bit more tip projection and therefore we fashioned a radiated rib into a small octagon and this wa sutured in place over the tip using two interrupted 50 pd suturesat this point we were happy with the test result although the patient did have significant amount of fullness in the dorsal hump area due to soft tissue thick and fullness  there do not appear to be any other pathology causing the patient dorsal hump and therefore we felt we have achieved the best cosmetic result at this point  the septum wa reapproximated using a fastabsorbing 40 suture and a keith needle placed in the mattress fashion  the kelly incision wa closed using two interrupted 40 fastabsorbing gut suture  doyle splint were then placed within the nasal cavity and secured to the inferior septum using a 30 monofilament suture  the columellar skin wa reapproximated using interrupted 60 nylon suture and the marginal incision of the vestibular skin wa closed using interrupted 40 chromic suturesat the end of the procedure all sponge needle and instrument count were correct  a denver external splint wa then applied  the patient wa awakened extubated and transported to anesthesia care unit in good condition ,2.0

of the system and continued obstruction  plan is for co surgeon due to the complexity of the situation and the solitary kidney to do surgical procedure to correct the obstructiondescription of operation  the patient wa taken to the operative room  surgical consent operative site and patient identification were verified  dr x and dr y both agreed upon the procedure in advance  dr y then once the patient wa anesthetized requested iv antibiotic with fortaz the patient had a caudal block placed and he wa then placed in lithotomy position  dr y then calibrated the urethra with the bougie a boule to 8 10 and up to 12 french  the 95french cystoscope sheath wa then placed within the patient bladder with the offset scope and his bladder had no evidence of cystitis  i wa able to locate the ureteral orifice bilaterally although no urine coming from the right  we then placed a 4french ureteral catheter into the ureter a far a we could go  an antegrade nephrostogram wa then performed which show that the contrast filled the dilated pelvis but did not go into the ureter  a retrograde wa performed and it wa found that there wa a narrowed band across the two  upon draining the ureter allowing to drain to gravity the pelvis which had been clamped and it nephrostomy tube did not drain at all  dr y then placed a 0035 guidewire into the ureter after removing the 4french catheter and then placed a 47french doublej catheter into the ureter a far a it would go allowing it to coil in the bladder  once this wa completed we then removed the cystoscope and sheath placed a 10french foley catheter and the patient wa positioned by dr x and dr y into the flank position with the left flank up after adequate padding on the arm and leg a well a a brachial plexus roll  he wa then sterilely prepped and draped  dr y then incised the skin with a 15blade knife through the old incision and then extended the incision with curved mosquito clamp and dr x performed cautery of the area advanced to be excised  once this wa then dissected dr y and dr x divided the lumbosacral fascia at the latissimus dorsi fascia posterior dorsal lumbotomy maneuver using the electrocautery and then using curved mosquito clamp   at this point dr x used the cautery to enter the posterior retroperitoneal space through the posterior abdominal fascia  dr y then used the curved right angle clamp and dissected around towards the ureter which wa markedly adherent to the base of the retroperitoneum  dr x and dr y also needed dissection on the medial and lateral aspect with dr y being on the lateral aspect of the area and dr x on the medial to get an adequate length of this  the tissue wa markedly inflamed and had significant adhesion noted  the patient spermatic vessel were also in the region a well a the renal vessel markedly scarred close to the ureteropelvic junction  ultimately dr y and dr x both with alternating dissection were able to dissect the renal pelvis to a position where dr y put stay suture and a 40 chromic to isolate the four quadrant area where we replaced the ureter  dr x then divided the ureter and suture ligated the base which wa obstructed with a 30 chromic suture  dr y then spatulated the ureter for about 15 cm and the stent wa gently delivered in a normal location out of the ureter at the proximal and left alone in the bladder  dr y then incised the renal pelvis and dissected and opened it enough to allow the new ureteropelvic junction repair to be performed  dr y then placed interrupted suture of 50 monocryl at the apex to repair the most dependent portion of the renal pelvis entered the lateral aspect interrupted suture of the repair  dr x then wa able to without much difficulty do interrupted suture on the medial aspect  the stent wa then placed into the bladder in the proper orientation and alternating suture by dr y and dr x closed the ureteropelvic junction without any evidence of leakage  once this wa complete we removed the extra stay stitch and watched the ureter lay back into the retroperitoneum in a normal position without any kinking in apparently good position  this opening wa at least 15 cm wide  dr y then placed 2 stay suture of 20 chromic in the lower pole of the kidney and then incised wedge biopsy and excised the biopsy with a 15blade knife and curved iris scissors for renal biopsy for determination of renal tissue health  electrocautery wa used on the base  there wa no bleeding however and the tissue wa quite soft  dermabond and gelfoam were placed and then dr y closed the biopsy site over with thrombingelfoam using the 20 chromic stay suture  dr x then closed the fascial layer with running suture of 30 vicryl in 3 layer  dr y closed the scarpa fascia and the skin with 40 vicryl and 40 rapide respectively  a 40 nylon suture wa then placed by dr y around the previous nephrostomy tube which wa again left clamped  dermabond tissue adhesive wa placed over the incision and then a dry sterile dressing wa placed by dr y over the nephrostomy tube site which wa left clamped and the patient then had a foley catheter placed in the bladder  the foley catheter wa then taped to his leg  a

patient wa unable to tolerate treatment with cpap  at the office we observed large tonsil and elongation and thickening of the uvula a well a redundant soft tissue of the palate  a tortuous appearance of the septum also wa observed  this morning i talked to the patient and his wife about the finding  i reviewed the ct image  he ha no history of sinus infection and doe not recall a history of nasal trauma  we discussed the removal of tonsil and uvula and soft palate tissue and the hope that this would help with his airway  depending on the finding of surgery i explained that i might remove that bone spur that we are seeing within the nasal passage  i will get the best look at it when he is asleep  we discussed recovery a well  he visited with dr xyz about the anesthetic produceprocedure  general tracheal anesthetic wa administered by dr xyz and mr radke  afrin drop were placed in both nostril and a cottonoid soaked with afrin wa placed in each side of the nose  a crowedavis mouth gag

tonsillar pillar  also there wa a cryptic appearance of the tonsil but there wa no acute redness or exudate  retraction of the soft palate permitted evaluation of the nasopharynx with the mirror and the choanae were patent and there wa no adenoid tissue present  a very crowded pharynx wa appreciated  the tonsil were first removed using electrodissection technique  hemostasis wa achieved with the electrocautery and with suture of 0 plain catgut  the tonsil fossa were injected with 025 marcaine with 1200000 epinephrine  there already wa more room in the pharynx but the posterior pharyngeal wall wa still obscured by the soft palate and uvula  the uvula wa grasped with the alice clamp  i palpated the posterior edge of the hard palate and calculated removal of about a third of the length of the soft palate  we switched over from the bayonet cautery to the blunt needle tip electrocautery  the planned anterior soft palate incision wa marked out with the electrocautery from the left anterior tonsillar pillar rising upwards and then extending horizontally across the soft palate to include all of the uvula and a portion of the soft palate and the incision then extended across the midline and then inferiorly to meet the right anterior tonsillar pillar  this incision wa then deepened with the electrocautery on a cutting current  the uvular artery just to the right of the midline wa controlled with the suction electrocautery  the posterior soft palate incision wa made parallel to the anterior soft palate incision but wa made leaving a longer length of mucosa to permit closure of the palatoplasty  a portion of the redundant soft palate mucosa tissue also wa included with the resection specimen and the tissue including the soft palate and uvula wa included with the surgical specimen a the tonsil were sent to pathology  the tonsil fossa were injected with 025 marcaine with 1200000 epinephrine  the soft palate wa also injected with 025 marcaine with 1200000 epinephrine  the posterior tonsillar pillar were then brought forward to close to the anterior tonsillar pillar and these were sutured down to the tonsil bed with interrupted 0 plain catgut suture  the posterior soft palate mucosa wa advanced forward and brought up to the anterior soft palate incision and closure of the soft palate wound wa then accomplished with interrupted 30 chromic catgut suture  a much

2007 and i found an ekg report by dr x which show atrial fibrillation on 082907 per her report  one of the question we were asked wa whether the patient would be a candidate for coumadin  clearly given her history of small ministrokes i think coumadin would be appropriate given this chronic atrial fibrillation but the main issue is the fall risk  if not felt to be significant fall risk then i would strongly recommend coumadin a the patient herself state that she ha only fallen twice in the past year  i would defer that decision to dr z and dr xy who know the patient well and it may be that physical therapy consult is appropriate to help adjudicaterecommendations1  fall assessment a per dr z and dr xy with possible pt consult if felt appropriate and if the patient is not felt to be at significant fall risk would put her on coumadin  given her history of small stroke a documented in the chart and her chronic atrial fibrillation she doe have reasonable heart rate control on current labetalol2  the patient ha elevated bnp and i suspect that is due to her severe pulmonary hypertension and renal failure and in the light of normal lv function i would not make any further evaluation of that other than aggressive diuresis3  regarding this minimal troponin elevation i do not feel this is a diagnosis especially in the setting of pulmonary hypertension and her smalltomoderate sized stable pericardial effusion again that ha been longstanding since 2007 from what i can tell and there is no evidence of tamponade  i would defer to her usual cardiologist dr x whether an outpatient stress evaluation is appropriate for risk stratification  i did find that the patient had a prior cardiac stress test in 0807 where they felt that there wa some subtle reversibility of the anterior wall but it wa felt that it may be artifact rather than true ischemia with normal lv function seen on that study a well4  continue norvasc for history of hypertension a well a labetalol5  the patient is felt to be a significant fall risk and will at least continue her aspirin 81 mg once a day for secondary cva thromboprophylaxis albeit understanding that it is inferior to coumadin6  continue

growing mass on the abdomen extending from the pelvis over the past two to three month  she had a recent dc and laparoscopy and enlarged mass wa noted and could not be determined if it wa from the ovary or the uterus  curettings were negative for malignancy  the patient did have a large cystocele and rectocele and a collapsed anterior and posterior vaginal wallupon laparotomy there wa a giant uterine tumor extending from the pelvis up to the above the umbilicus compatible with approximately four to fivemonth pregnancy  the ovary appeared to be within normal limit  there wa marked adherence between the bladder and the giant uterus and mass with edema and inflammation and during dissection a laceration inadvertently occurred and it wa immediately recognized  no other pathology noted from the abdominal cavity or adhesion  the upper right quadrant of the abdomen compatible with a previous gallbladder surgery  the appendix is in it normal anatomic position  the ileum wa within normal limit with no meckels diverticulum seen and no other gross pathology evident  there wa no evidence of metastasis or tumor in the left lobe of the liverupon frozen section diagnosis of initial and partial is that of a degenerating uterine fibroid rather than a malignancyoperative procedure  the patient wa taken to the operating room prepped and draped in the low lithotomy position under general anesthesia  a midline incision wa made around the umbilicus down to the lower abdomen  with a 10 bard parker blade knife the incision wa carried down through the fascia  the fascia wa incised in the midline muscle fiber were splint in the midline the peritoneum wa grasped with hemostat and with a 10 bard parker blade after incision wa made with mayo scissors  a balfour retractor wa placed into the wound  this giant uterus wa soft and compatible with a possible leiomyosarcoma or degenerating fibroid wa handled with care  the infundibular ligament on the right side wa isolated and ligated with 0 vicryl suture brought to an avascular area doubly clamped and divided from the ovary and the ligament again religated with 0 vicryl suture  the right round ligament wa ligated with 0 vicryl suture brought to an avascular space within the broad ligament and divided from the uterus  the infundibulopelvic ligament on the left side wa treated in a similar fashion a well a the round ligament  an attempt wa made to dissect the bladder flap from the anterior surface of the uterus and this wa remarkably edematous and difficult to do and during dissection the bladder wa inadvertently entered  after this wa immediately recognized the bladder flap wa wiped away from the anterior surface of the uterus  the bladder wa then repaired with a running locking stitch 0 vicryl suture incorporating serosal muscularis mucosa and then the second layer of overlapping seromuscular suture were used to make a twolayer closure of 0 vicryl suture  after removing the uterus the bladder wa tested with approximately 400 cc of sterile water and there appeared to be no leak  progressing and removing of the uterus wa then carried out and the broad ligament wa clamped bilaterally with a straight ochsner forceps and divided from the uterus with mayo scissors and the straight ochsner wa placed by 0 vicryl suture thus controlling the uterine blood supply  the cardinal ligament containing the cervical blood supply wa serially clamped bilaterally with a curved ochsner forceps divided from the uterus with 10 bard parker blade knife and a curved ochsner wa placed by 0 vicryl suture  the cervix wa again grasped with a lahey tenaculum and pubovesicocervical ligament wa entered and wa divided using 10 bard parker blade knife and then the vaginal vault and with a double pointed sharp scissors  a singletoothed tenaculum wa placed on the cervix and then the uterus wa removed from the vagina using hysterectomy scissors  the vaginal cuff wa then closed using a running 0 vicryl suture in locking

generalindications  this is a 63yearold white male patient with multiple medical problem including hypertension diabetes endstage renal disease coronary artery disease and the patient is on hemodialysis who ha had recurrent episode of epigastric right upper quadrant pain  the patient wa found to have cholelithiasis on last admission  he wa being worked up for this including cardiac clearance  however in the interim he returned again with another episode of same pain  the patient had a hida scan done yesterday which show nonvisualization of the gallbladder consistent with cystic duct obstruction  because of these laparoscopic cholecystectomy wa advised with cholangiogram  possibility of open laparotomy and open procedure wa also explained to the patient  the procedure indication risk and alternative were discussed with the patient in detail and informed consent wa obtaineddescription of procedure  the patient wa put in supine position on the operating table under satisfactory general anesthesia  the entire abdomen wa prepped and draped  a small transverse incision wa made about 212 inch above the umbilicus in the midline under local anesthesia  the patient ha a rather long torso  fascia wa opened vertically and stay suture were placed in the fascia  peritoneal cavity wa carefully entered  hasson cannula wa inserted into the peritoneal cavity and it wa insufflated with co2  laparoscopic camera wa inserted and examination at this time showed difficult visualization with a part of omentum and hepatic flexure of the colon stuck in the subhepatic area  the patient wa placed in reverse trendelenburg and rotated to the left  an 11mm trocar wa placed in the subxiphoid space and two 5mm in the right subcostal region  slowly the dissection wa carried out in the right subhepatic area  initially i wa able to dissect some of the omentum and hepatic flexure off the undersurface of the liver  then some inflammatory change were noted with some fatty necrosis type of change and it wa not quite clear whether this wa part of the gallbladder or it wa just pericholecystic infectioninflammation  the visualization wa extremely difficult because of the patient obesity and a lot of fat intraabdominally although his abdominal wall is not that thick  after evaluating this for a little while we decided that there wa no way that this could be done laparoscopically and proceeded with formal laparotomy  the trocars were removeda right subcostal incision wa made and peritoneal cavity wa entered  a bookwalter retractor wa put in place  the dissection wa then carried out on the undersurface of the liver  eventually the gallbladder wa identified which wa markedly scarred down and shrunk and appeared to have palpable stone in it  dissection wa further carried down to what wa felt to be the common bile duct which appeared to be somewhat larger than normal about a centimeter in size  the duodenum wa kocherized  the gallbladder wa partly intrahepatic  because of this i decided not to dig it out of the liver bed causing further bleeding and problem  the inferior wall of the gallbladder wa opened and two large stone one wa about 3 cm long and another one about 15 x 2 cm long were taken out of the gallbladderit wa difficult to tell where the cystic duct wa  eventually after probing near the neck of the gallbladder i did find the cystic duct which wa relatively very short  intraoperative cystic duct cholangiogram wa done using carm fluoroscopy  this showed a rounded density at the lower end of the bile duct consistent with the stone  at this time a decision wa made to proceed with common duct exploration  the common duct wa opened between stay suture of 40 vicryl and immediately essentially clear bile came out  after some pressing over the head of the pancreas through a kocherized maneuver the stone did fall into the opening in the common bile duct  so it wa about a 1cm size stone which wa removed  following this a 10french red rubber catheter wa passed into the common bile duct both proximally and distally and irrigated generously  no further stone were obtained  the catheter went easily into the duodenum through the ampulla of vater  at this point a choledochoscope wa inserted and proximally i did not see any evidence of any common duct stone or proximally into the biliary tree  however a stone wa found distally still floating around  this wa removed with stone forceps  the bile duct were irrigated again  no further stone were removed  a 16french ttube wa then placed into the bile duct and the bile duct wa repaired around the ttube using 40 vicryl interrupted suture obtaining watertight closure  a completion ttube cholangiogram wa done at this time which showed slight narrowing and possibly a filling defect proximally below the confluence of the right and left hepatic duct although externally i wa unable to see anything or palpate anything in this area  because of this the ttube wa removed and i passed the choledochoscope proximally again and i wa unable to see any evidence of any lesion or any stone in this area  i felt at this time this wa most likely an impression from the outside which wa still left over a gallbladder where the stone wa stuck and it wa impressing on the bile duct  the bile duct lumen wa widely open  ttube wa again replaced into the bile duct and closed again and a completion ttube cholangiogram appeared to be more satisfactory at this time  the cystic duct opening through which i had done earlier a cystic duct cholangiogram this wa closed with a figureofeight suture of 20 vicryl and this wa actually done earlier and completion cholangiogram did not show any leak from this areathe remaining gallbladder bed which wa left in situ wa cauterized both for hemostasis and to burn off the mucosal lining  subhepatic and subdiaphragmatic space were irrigated with sterile saline solution  hemostasis wa good  a 10mm jacksonpratt drain wa left in the foramen of winslow and brought out through the lateral 5mm port site  the ttube wa brought out through the middle 5mm port site which wa just above the incision  abdominal incision wa then closed in layer using 0 vicryl running suture for the peritoneal layer and 1 novafil running suture for the fascia  subcutaneous tissue wa closed with 30 vicryl running suture in two layer  subfascial and subcutaneous tissue were injected with a total of 20 ml of 025 marcaine with epinephrine for postoperative pain control  the umbilical incision wa closed with 0 vicryl figureofeight suture for the fascia 20 vicryl for the subcutaneous tissue and staple for the skin  sterile dressing wa applied and the patient transferred to recovery room in stable condition ,2.0

catheter to take multiple cineangiograms of the right and left coronary artery  after using the jr4 6french catheter nitroglycerin wa administered because of the possibility of ostial spasm and following that we used a 5french jr4 catheter for additional cineangiograms of the right coronary artery  a pigtail catheter wa placed in the mid abdominal aorta and abdominal aortic injection wa performed to rule out abdominal aortic aneurysm a there wa dense calcification in the mid abdominal aortaanalysis of pressure data  left ventricular enddiastolic pressure wa 5 mmhg  on continuous

aneurysmal dilatation andor dyskinesia absent  the aortic valve is tricuspid and normal mobility  the ascending aorta appeared normalpigtail catheter wa introduced in the mid abdominal aorta and placed just above the renal artery  an abdominal aortic injection wa performed  under fluoroscopy we see heavy dense calcification of the mid abdominal aorta between the renal artery and the

mild intimal irregularity  there is a normal left renal artery normal right renal artery  the celiac seems to be normal but what i believe is the splenic artery seen initially at it origin is normal  the common left iliac and common right iliac artery are essentially normal in this areacoronary anatomy  one note ostial coronary calcification of the right coronary artery  cineangiogram obtained with 6french jr4 and 5french jr4 catheter  prior to the introduction of the 5french jr4 nitroglycerin wa administered sublingually  the 6french jr4 catheter appeared to a show an ostial lesion of over 50  there wa backwash of dye into the aorta although there is a fine funneling of the ostium towards the proximal right coronary artery  in the proximal portion of the right coronary artery just into the shepherd turn there is a 50 smooth tapering of the right coronary artery in the proximal third  then the artery seems to have a little bit more normal size and it divide into a large posterior descending artery posterolateral branch vessel  the distal portion of the vessel is free of disease  the conus branch is seen arising right at the beginning part of the right coronary artery  we then removed the 6french catheter and following nitroglycerin and sublingually we placed a 5french catheter and again finding a stenosis may be le than 50  at the ostium of the right coronary artery calcification again is identified  backwash of dye noted at the proximal lesion looked about the same 50 along the proximal turn of the shepherd turn areathe left coronary artery is normal although there is a rim of ostial calcification but there is no tapering or stenosis  it form the left anterior descending artery the ramus branch and the circumflex arterythe left anterior descending artery is a very large vessel very tortuous in it proximal segment very tortuous in it mid and distal segment  there appears to be some mild stenosis of 10 in the proximal segment  it give off a large diagonal branch in the proximal portion of the left anterior descending artery and it is free of disease  the remaining portion of the left anterior descending artery is free of disease  upon injection of the left coronary artery we see what i believe is the dye enters probably directly into the left ventricle but via fistula excluding the coronary sinus and we get a ventriculogram performed  i could not identify an isolated area but it seems to be from the interventricular septal collateral that this is taking placethe ramus branch is normal and free of diseasethe left

wheeled back to operating room 5 at abcd general hospital on 082803  after a general anesthetic wa administered a foley catheter wa insertedthe patient wa then turned prone on the jackson table  all of his bony prominence were wellpadded  at this time a myelogram wa then performed  after the lumbar spine wa prepped a 20 gauge needle wa then used to perform a myelogram  the needle wa localized to the level of l3l4 region  once inserted into the thecal sac we immediately got cerebrospinal fluid through the spinal needle  at this time approximately 10 cc of conray injected into the thecal sac  the patient wa then placed in the reversed trendelenburg position in order to assist with distal migration of the contrast  the myelogram did reveal that there wa some space occupying lesion most likely disc at the level of l5s1 on the left  there wa a lack of space filling defect on the left evident on both the ap and the lateral projection using carm fluoroscopy  at this point the patient wa then fully prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for this procedure for a microdiscectomy  a long spinal needle wa then inserted into region of surgery on the right  the surgery wa going to be on the left  once the spinal needle wa inserted a localizing fluoroscopy wa then used to assure appropriate location and this did confirm that we were at the l5s1 nerve root region  at this time an approximately 2 cm skin incision wa made over the lumbar region dissected down to the deep lumbar fascia  at this time a weitlaner wa inserted  bovie cautery wa used to obtain hemostasis  we further continued through the deep lumbar fascia and dissected off the short lumbar muscle off of the spinous process and the lamina  a cobb elevator wa then used to elevate subperiosteally off of all the inserting short lumbar muscle off of the spinous process a well a the lamina on the lefthand side  at this time a taylor retractor wa then inserted and held there for retraction  suction a well a bovie cautery wa used to obtain hemostasis  at this time a small kerrison rongeur wa used to make a small lumbar laminotomy to expose our window for the nerve root decompression  once the laminotomy wa performed a small  curette wa used to elevate the ligamentum flavum off of the thecal sac a well a the adjoining nerve root  once the ligamentum flavum wa removed we immediately identified a piece of disc material floating around outside of the disc space over the s1 nerve root which wa compressive  we removed the extruded disc with further freeing up of the s1 nerve root  a nerve root retractor wa then placed  identification of disc space wa then performed  a 15 blade wa then inserted and small a key hole into the disc space wa then performed with a 15 blade  a small pituitary wa then inserted within the disc space and more disc material wa freed and removed  the part of the annulus fibrosis were also removed in addition to the loose intranuclear piece of disc  once this wa performed we removed the retraction off the nerve root and the nerve root appeared to be free with pulsatile visualization of the vasculature indicating that the nerve root wa essentially freeat this time copious irrigation wa used to irrigate the wound  we then performed another look to see if any loose piece of disc were extruding from the disc space and only small piece were evident and they were then removed with the pituitary rongeur  at this time a small piece of gelfoam wa then used to cover the exposed nerve root  we did not have any dural leak during this case  10 vicryl wa then used to approximate the deep lumbar fascia 20 vicryl wa used to approximate the superficial lumbar fascia and 40 running vicryl for the subcutaneous skin  sterile dressing were then applied  the

pulse oximetry noninvasive blood pressure and ekg monitoring  prior to starting the procedure the patient wa noted to have a baseline oxygen saturation of 86 on room air  subsequently she wa given a bronchodilator treatment with atrovent and albuterol and subsequent saturation increased to approximately 90 to 91 on room airthe patient wa placed on a supplemental oxygen a the patient wa sedated with abovestated medication  a this occurred the bronchoscope wa inserted into the right naris with good visualization of the nasopharynx and oropharynx  the cord were noted to oppose bilaterally on phonation  there wa some slight mucosal irregularity noted on the vocal cord on the left side  additional topical lidocaine wa instilled on the vocal cord at which point the bronchoscope wa introduced into the trachea which wa midline in nature  the bronchoscope wa then advanced to the distal trachea and additional lidocaine wa instilled  at this time the bronchoscope wa further advanced through the main stem and additional lidocaine wa instilled  bronchoscope wa then further advanced into the right upper lobe which revealed no evidence of any endobronchial lesion  the mucosa wa diffusely friable throughout  bronchoscope wa then slowly withdrawn into the right main stem and additional lidocaine wa instilled  at this point the bronchoscope wa then advanced to the right bronchus intermedius  at this time it wa noted that there wa severe mucosal irregularity of nodular in appearance significantly narrowing the right lower lobe and right middle lobe opening  the mucosal area throughout this region wa severely friable  additional lidocaine wa instilled a well a topical epinephrine  at this time bronchoscope wa maintained in this region and endobronchial biopsy were performed  at the initial attempt of inserting biopsy forceps some resistance wa noted within the proximal channel at this time making advancement of the biopsy forceps out of the proximal channel impossible  so the biopsy forceps wa withdrawn and the bronchoscope wa completely withdrawn and new bronchoscope wa then utilized  at this time bronchoscope wa then reinserted into the right naris and subsequently advanced to the vocal cord into the right bronchus intermedius without difficulty  at this time the biopsy forceps were easily passed and visualized in the right bronchus intermedius  at this time multiple mucosal biopsy were performed with some mild oozing noted  several aliquot of normal saline lavage followed  after completion of multiple biopsy there wa good hemostasis  cytology

deviation of the hallux  there wa decreased range of motion of the first metatarsophalangeal joint  a dorsolinear incision wa made with a 10 blade approximately 4 cm in length  the incision wa deepened to the subcutaneous layer with a 15 blade  any small vein traversing the subcutaneous layer were ligated with electrocautery  next the medial and lateral wound margin were undermined sharply  care wa taken to avoid the medial neurovascular bundle and the lateral extensor hallucis longus tendon  next the first metatarsal joint capsule wa identified  a 15 blade wa used to make a linear capsular incision down to the bone  the capsular periosteal tissue were elevated off the bone with a 15 blade and the metatarsal head wa delivered into the wound  the pasa wa found to be within normal limit  there wa a hypertrophic medial eminence noted  a sagittal saw wa used to remove the hypertrophic medial eminence  a 0045 inch kirschner wire wa placed into the central medial aspect of the metatarsal head a an access guide  a standard lateral release wa performed  the fibular sesamoid wa found to be in the interspace but wa relocated onto the metatarsal head properly  next a sagittal

the osteotomy  a 27 x 16 mm synthes fully threaded cortical screw wa throne using standard ao technique  a second screw wa throne which wa a 20 x 12 mm synthes cortical screw  excellent fixation wa achieved and the screw tightly perched the bone  next the medial overhanging wedge wa removed with a sagittal saw  a reciprocating rasp wa used to smooth all bony prominence  the 0045 inch kirschner wire wa removed  the screw were checked again for tightness and found to be very tight  the joint wa flushed with copious amount of sterile saline  a 30 vicryl wa used to close the capsular periosteal tissue with simple interrupted suture technique  a 40 vicryl wa used to close the subcutaneous layer in a simple interrupted technique  a 50 monocryl wa used to close the skin in a running subcuticular fashionattention wa directed to the right third digit which wa found to be markedly contracted at the distal interphalangeal joint  a 15 blade wa used to make two convergent semielliptical incision over the distal interphalangeal joint  the incision wa deepened with a 15 blade  the wedge of skin wa removed in full thickness  the long extensor tendon wa identified and the distal and proximal border of the wound were undermined  the 15 blade wa used to transect the long extensor tendon which wa reflected proximally  the distal interphalangeal joint wa identified and the 15 blade wa placed in the joint and the medial and lateral collateral ligament were released  crown and collar scissors were used to release the planar attachment to the head of the middle phalanx  next a double action bone cutter wa used to resect the head of the middle phalanx  the toe wa dorsiflexed and wa found to have an excellent rectus position  a hand rasp wa used to smooth all bony surface  the joint wa flushed with copious amount of sterile saline  the flexor tendon wa found to be contracted therefore a flexor tenotomy wa performed through the dorsal incision  next 30 vicryl wa used to close the long extensor tendon with two simple interrupted suture  a 40 nylon wa used to close the skin and excellent cosmetic result wa achievedattention wa directed to the fourth toe which wa found to be contracted at the distal interphalangeal joint and abducted and varus rotated  an oblique skin incision with two converging semielliptical incision wa created using 15 blade  the rest of the procedure wa repeated exactly the same a the above paragraph to the third toe on the right foot  all the same suture material were used  however there wa no flexor tenotomy performed on this toe only on the third toe bilaterallyattention wa directed to the fifth right digit which wa found to be contracted at the proximal interphalangeal joint  a linear incision approximately 2 cm in length wa made with a 15 blade over the proximal interphalangeal joint  next a 15 blade wa used to deepen the incision to the subcutaneous layer  the medial and lateral margin were undermined sharply

incidentally intraoperatively with approximately 150 ml to 200 ml of turbid fluid  cyst wall tube and ovary were stripped away from the bowel  posterior peritoneum wa also removed in order to completely remove the cyst wall ovary and tube  there wa excellent postoperative hemostasisprocedure  the patient wa taken to the operating room where general anesthesia wa achieved without difficulty  she wa then placed in a dorsal supine position and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion  a vertical midline incision wa made from the umbilicus and extended to the symphysis pubis along the line of the patient prior incision  incision wa carried down carefully until the peritoneal cavity wa reached  care wa taken upon entry of the peritoneum to avoid injury of underlying structure  at this point the extensive adhesive disease wa noted again requiring greater than 45 minute of dissection in order to visualize the intended anatomy for surgery  the omentum wa carefully stripped away from the patient right side developing a window  this wa extended down along the inferior portion of the incision removing the omentum from it adhesion to the anterior peritoneum and what appears to be the vesicouterine peritoneum  a large mass of bowel wa noted to be adherent to itself causing a quite tortuous course  adhesiolysis wa performed in order to free up the bowel in order to pack it out of the pelvis  excellent hemostasis wa noted  the bowel wa then packed over of the pelvis allowing visualization of a matted mass of large and small bowel surrounding a large ovarian cyst  careful adhesive lysis and dissection enabled the colon to be separated from the posterior wall of the cyst  small bowel and portion of the colon were adherent anteriorly on the cyst and during the dissection of these to remove them from their attachment the cyst wa ruptured  large amount of turbid fluid wa noted and wa evacuated  the cyst wall wa then carefully placed under tension and stripped away from the patient small and large bowel  once the bowel wa freed the remnant of round ligament wa identified elevated and the peritoneum wa incised opening the retroperitoneal spacethe retroperitoneal space wa opened following the line of the ovarian vessel which were identified and elevated and a window made inferior to the ovarian vessel but superior to the course of the ureter  this pedicle wa doubly clamped transected and tied with a free tie of 20 vicryl  a suture ligature of 0 vicryl wa used to obtain hemostasis  excellent hemostasis wa noted at this pedicle  the posterior peritoneum and portion of the remaining broad ligament were carefully dissected and shelled out to remove the tube and ovary which wa still densely adherent to the peritoneum  care wa taken at the side of the remnant of the uterine vessel  however a laceration of the uterine vessel did occur which wa clamped with a rightangle clamp and carefully sutured ligated with excellent hemostasis noted  remainder of the specimen wa then shelled out including portion of the posterior and sidewall peritoneum and removedthe opposite tube and ovary were identified were also matted behind a large amount of large bowel and completely enveloped and wrapped in the fallopian tube  minimal dissection wa performed in order to ascertain and ensure that the ovary appeared completely normal  it wa then left in situ  hemostasis wa achieved in the pelvis with the use of electrocautery  the abdomen and pelvis were copiously irrigated with warm saline solution  the peritoneal edge were inspected and found to have good hemostasis after the side of the uterine artery pedicle and the ovarian vessel pedicle  the area of the bowel had previously been dissected and due to adhesive disease it wa carefully inspected and excellent hemostasis wa notedall instrument and pack removed from the patient abdomen  the abdomen wa closed with a running mattress closure of 0 pd beginning at the superior aspect of the incision and extending inferiorly  excellent closure of the incision wa noted  the subcutaneous tissue were then copiously irrigated  hemostasis wa achieved with the use of cautery  subcutaneous tissue were reapproximated to close the edge space with a several interrupted suture of 0 plain gut suture  the skin wa closed with staplesincision wa sterilely clean and dressed  the patient wa

of which were reviewed  a previous xray study of the lateral chest performed in october 2008 showed poor inspiration with basilar atelectasis and an infiltrate  an xray of the cervical thoracic and lumbar spine showed some evidence of lumbar spinal stenosis  a cta of the neck with and without contrast performed in november 2008 showed minor stenosis in the left carotid a mild hard and soft plaque in the right carotid with approximately 55 stenosis  the posterior circulation showed a slightly dominant right vertebral artery with no stenosis  there wa no significant stenosis but there wa minor extracranial stenosis noted  an mri of the brain with and without contrast performed in november 2008 showed no evidence of an acute infarct major vascular occlusion and no abnormal enhancement with gadolinium administration  there wa also no significant sinusitis or mastoiditis  this wa an essentially normal brain mri  a cbc performed in january 2009 showed an elevated white cell count of 113 a low red cell count of 343 elevated mch of 324 and the rest of the study wa normal  an electrolyte study performed in january 2009 showed a sodium which wa low at 127 a calcium which wa low at 83

wall motion of the left ventricle  the left ventricular ejection fraction wa 68 which is within the normal range for male  a ct of the lumbar spine without contrast performed in december 2008 showed a broadbased disc bulge at l1l2 l2l3 l3l4 and l4l5  at l5s1 in addition to the broadbased disc bulge there wa also an osteophyte complex and evidence of flavum hypertrophy without canal stenosis  there wa severe bilateral neural foraminal stenosis at l5s1 and moderate neural foraminal stenosis at l1l4  an echocardiogram wa performed in november 2008 and showed mild left atrial enlargement normal left ventricular systolic function mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy scleral degenerative change in the aortic and mitral apparatus mild mitral regurgitation mild tricuspid regurgitation and mild to moderate aortic regurgitationdiagnostic impression  the patient present with a severe neuropathy with marked large fiber sensory a well a motor finding  he is diffusely weak a well a atrophic in all muscle group both in his upper and lower extremity although he is disproportionately weak in his lower extremity  his proprioceptive and vibratory loss is severe in both the distal upper and lower extremity signifying that he either ha a severe sensory neuropathy or ha involvement of the dorsal root ganglion  according to the history which wa carefully checked the initial onset of these symptom go back one and a half year although there ha only been significant progression in his condition since july 2008  a indicated below further diagnostic study including a detailed nerve conduction and emg test today showed evidence of a severe sensory motor and axonal neuropathy and in addition there wa evidence of a diffuse polyradiculopathy  there wa no involvement of the tongue on emg  the laboratory testing a indicated below failed to show a specific cause for the neuropathy  we are still however waiting for the paraneoplastic antibody which were send out lab to the mayo clinic  this type of very severe sensorimotor neuropathy with significant proprioceptive loss may be seen in several condition including peripheral nerve vasculitis due to a variety of disorder such a sle sjogrens rheumatoid arthritis and mixed connective tissue disease  in addition it may also be seen with certain toxin particularly chemotherapeutic agent  the patient did not receive any of these  it may also be seen a part of a paraneoplastic syndrome  although the patient doe not have any specific clinical symptom of a cancer it is noted that he ha had an 18pound weight loss in the past month and doe have a remote history of smoking  we have requested that he obtain a ct of his chest abdomen and pelvis while he is in acute rehabilitation  the verbal report of these possibly did not show any evidence of a cancer  we did also request that he obtain a gallium scan to see if there wa any evidence of an unsuspected neoplasm  the patient did undergo a nerve and muscle biopsy this wa a radial nerve and biceps muscle biopsy from the left arm  this showed evidence of severe axonal loss  there wa no evidence of a vasculitis  the vessel did show some mild intimal change that would be consistent with atherosclerosis  there were a few perivascular change however there wa no clear evidence of a necrotizing vasculitis even on multiple section  the muscle biopsy showed severe muscle fiber atrophy with evidence of fiber grouping  again there wa no evidence of inflammation or vasculitis  evaluation so far ha also shown no evidence of an amyloid neuropathy no evidence of a monoclonal gammopathy of sarcoidosis and again there is no past history of a significant toxin or infective cause for the neuropathy  specifically there is no history of hiv exposure  we would await the result of the gallium scan and of the paraneoplastic antibody to see if these are helpful in making a diagnosis  at this point because of the severity and the axonal nature of the neuropathy there is no specific therapy that will reverse the course of the illness unless we find a specific etiology that can be stopped or reversed  i have discussed these issue at length with the patient and with his son  we also addressed whether or not there might be a previously undiagnosed inherited neuropathy  i think this is unlikely given the short history and the rapid progression of the disorderthere is also no family history that we can detect a neuropathy and the patient doe not have the typical phenotype for a chronic inherited neuropathy such a charcotmarietooth disease type 2  however since i have only seen the patient on one occasion and do not know what his previous examination showed two year ago i cannot be certain that there may not have been the presence of a neuropathy preceding thisplan1  nerve conduction and emg will be performed today  the result were indicated above2  the following laboratory study were requested including electrolyte cbc thyroid function test b12 ana

011106 he is now 77 year old he is being seen on the seventh floor the patient is in room 7607 the patient ha a history of recent adenocarcinoma of the duodenum that wa found to be inoperable since it engulfed the porta hepatis the workup began with gi bleeding he wa seen in my office on 011106 for preop evaluation due to leg edema a nonocclusive dvt wa diagnosed in the proximal left superficial femoral vein both leg were edematous and bilateral venous insufficiency wa also present an echocardiogram demonstrated an ejection fraction of 50 the patient wa admitted to the hospital and treated with a greenfield filter since anticoagulant wa contraindicated additional information on the echocardiogram where a grossly dilated left atrium moderately severely dilated right atrium the rhythm wa a stated before atrial fibrillation with slow atrioventricular conduction and an intraventricular conduction delay on the monitor strip there wa mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation mild pulmonic insufficiency the ejection fraction wa considered low normal since it wa estimated 50 to 54 the patient received blood while in the hospital due to anemia the leg edema improved while lying down suggesting that the significant element of venous insufficiency wa indeed present the patient who wa diabetic received consultation by dr r he wa also a chronic hypertensive and wa treated for that with ace inhibitor the atrial fibrillation wa slow and no digitalis or beta blocker were recommended at the same time a a matter of fact they were discontinued now the patient denied any shortness of breath or chest pain throughout this hospitalization and cardiac nuclear study performed earlier demonstrated no reversible ischemiaallergies the patient ha no known drug allergieshis diabetes wa

scenario whereby he will become a candidate for management of this arrhythmia beyond weight control he is also not a candidate for anticoagulation which is in essence a part and parcel of the weight control reason being is high likelihood for gi bleeding especially given the diagnosis of invasive malignancy with involvement of multiple organ and lymph node at this point i agree with the notion of hospice care if his atrioventricular conduction becomes excessive occasional nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker such a diltiazem or beta blocker would be appropriate otherwise i would keep him off those medication due to evidence of slow conduction in the presence of digitalis and beta blocker ,1.0

with abovestated medication  a this occurred the bronchoscope wa inserted into the right naris with good visualization of the nasopharynx and oropharynx  the cord were noted to oppose bilaterally on phonation  there wa some slight mucosal irregularity noted on the vocal cord on the left side  additional topical lidocaine wa instilled on the vocal cord at which point the bronchoscope wa introduced into the trachea which wa midline in nature  the bronchoscope wa then advanced to the distal trachea and additional lidocaine wa instilled  at this time the bronchoscope wa further advanced through the main stem and additional lidocaine wa instilled  bronchoscope wa then further advanced into the right upper lobe which revealed no evidence of any endobronchial lesion  the mucosa wa diffusely friable throughout  bronchoscope wa then slowly withdrawn into the right main stem and additional lidocaine wa instilled  at this point the bronchoscope wa then advanced to the right bronchus intermedius  at this time it wa noted that there wa severe mucosal irregularity of nodular in appearance significantly narrowing the right lower lobe and right middle lobe opening  the mucosal area throughout this region wa severely friable  additional lidocaine wa instilled a well a topical epinephrine  at this time bronchoscope wa maintained in this region and endobronchial biopsy were performed  at the initial attempt of inserting biopsy forceps some resistance wa noted within the proximal channel at this time making advancement of the biopsy forceps out of the proximal channel impossible  so the biopsy forceps wa withdrawn and the bronchoscope wa completely withdrawn and new bronchoscope wa then utilized  at this time bronchoscope wa then reinserted into the right naris and subsequently advanced to the vocal cord into the right bronchus intermedius without difficulty  at this time the biopsy forceps were easily passed and visualized in the right bronchus intermedius  at this time multiple mucosal biopsy were performed with some mild oozing noted  several aliquot of normal saline lavage followed  after completion of multiple biopsy there wa good hemostasis  cytology flushing wa also performed in this region and subsequently several aliquot of additional normal saline lavage wa followed  bronchoscope wa unable to be passed distally to the base of the segment of the right lower lobe or distal to the further visualized endobronchial anatomy of the right middle lobe subsegments  the bronchoscope wa then withdrawn to the distal tracheaat this time bronchoscope wa then advanced to the left main stem  additional lidocaine wa instilled  the bronchoscope wa advanced to the left upper and lower lobe subsegments  there wa no endobronchial lesion visualized  there is mild diffuse erythema and fibromucosa wa noted throughout  no endobronchial lesion wa visualized in the left bronchial system  the bronchoscope wa then subsequently further withdrawn to the distal trachea and readvanced into the right bronchial system  at this time bronchoscope wa readvanced into the right bronchus intermedius and additional aliquot of normal saline lavage until cleared  there is no gross bleeding evidenced at this time or diffuse mucosal erythema and edema present throughout  the bronchoscope wa subsequently withdrawn and the patient wa sent to recovery room  during the bronchoscopy the patient noted  have desaturation and required increasing fio2 with subsequent increased saturation to 93 to 94  the patient remained at this level of saturation or greater throughout the remaining of the procedurethe patient postprocedure relates having some intermittent hemoptysis prior to the procedure a well a moderate exertional dyspnea  this wa confirmed by her daughter and mother who were also present at the bedside postprocedure  the patient did receive a nebulizer bronchodilator treatment immediately prebronchoscopy and postprocedure a well  the patient also admitted to continued smoking in spite of all of the above  the patient wa extensively counseled regarding the continued smoking especially with her present symptom  she wa advised regarding smoking cessation  the patient wa also placed on a prescription of prednisone 2 mg tablet starting at 40 mg a day decreasing every three day to continue to wean off  the patient wa also administered solumedrol 60 mg iv x1 in recovery room  there wa no significant bronchospastic component noted although because of the severity of the mucosal edema erythema and her complaint short course of steroid will be instituted  the patient wa also advised to refrain from using any aspirin or other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medication because of her hemoptysis  at this time the patient wa also advised that if hemoptysis were to continue or worsen or develop progressive dyspnea to either contact myself  or return to abcd emergency room for evaluation of possible admission  however the above wa reviewed with the

table in the supine position  a safety strap wa placed across her waist for protectionnext a pneumatic ankle tourniquet wa applied around her left ankle over copious amount of webril for the patient protection  after adequate iv sedation wa administered by the department of anesthesia a total of 20 cc of a mixture of 45 cc of 1 lidocaine plain 45 cc of 05 marcaine plain and 1 cc of solumedrol per 10 cc dose wa administered to the patient for local anesthesia  the foot wa then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic manner  the foot wa then elevated and a tourniquet wa then placed at 230 mmhg after applying esmarch bandage  the foot wa then lowered down the operative field and sterile stockinet wa draped  the stockinet wa then reflected  attention wa then directed to the second intermetatarsal interspace  after testing the anesthesia a 4 cm incision wa placed using a 10 blade over the dorsal surface of the foot in the second intermetatarsal space beginning from proximal third of the metatarsal distally to and beyond the metatarsal head  then using 15 blade the incision wa deepened through the skin into the subcutaneous tissue  care wa taken to identify and avoid or to cauterize any local encountered vascular structure  incision wa deepened using the combination of blunt and dull dissection using mayo scissors hemostat and a 15 blade  the incision wa deepened distally down to the level of the deep transverse metatarsal ligament which wa reflected and exposure of the intermetatarsal space wa appreciated  the individual branch of the plantar digital nerve were identified extending into the second and third digit plantarly  these ending were dissected distally and cut at their most distal portion  following this the nerve wa dissected proximally into the common nerve and dissected proximally into the proximal portion of the intermetatarsal space  using careful meticulous dissection there wa noted to a be a enlarged bulbous mass of fiber and nerve tissue embedded with the adipose tissue  this wa also cut and removed  the proximal portion of the nerve stump wa identified and care wa taken to suture this into the lumbrical muscle to leave no free nerve ending exposed  following this the interspace wa irrigated with copious amount of sterile saline and interspace explored for any other portion of nerve which may been missed on the previous dissection  it wa noted that no other portion of the nerve were detectable and the proximal free nerve ending wa embedded and found to be  the lumbrical muscle belly  following this the interspace wa packed using iodoform gauze packing and wa closed in layer with the packing extruding from the wound  attention wa then directed to the third interspace where in a manner a mentioned before  a dorsal linear incision which measured 5 cm wa made over the third interspace extending from the proximal portion of the metatarsal distally to the metatarsal head  like before using a combination of blunt and dull dissection with sharp dissection the incision wa deepened down with care taken to cauterize all retracting vascular structure which were encounteredthe incision wa deepened down to the level of the subcutaneous tissue and then down deeper to the interspace of the third and fourth metatarsal  the dissection wa deepened distally down to the level of the transverse intermetatarsal ligament where upon this wa reflected and the nerve fiber to the third and fourth digit plantarly were identified  these were once again dissected distally out and transected at their most distal portion  care wa then taken to dissect the nerve proximally into the proximal metatarsal region  no other branch of the nerve were identified and the nerve in it entirety along with fibrous tissue encountered in the area wa removed  the proximal portion of the nerve which remained wa not large enough to suture into lumbrical muscle a wa done in the previous interspace  half of the nerve wa transected proximally a wa feasible and no exposed ending wa noted  incision wa then flushed and irrigated using sterile saline  following this the incision wound wa packed with iodoform gauze packed and closed in layer using a before 40 vicryl and 40 nylon suturefollowing this attention wa directed to the fifth metatarsal head where a lateral 4 cm incision wa placed along the lateral distal shaft and head of the fifth metatarsal using a fresh 10 blade  the incision wa then deepened using 15 blade down to the level of the subcutaneous tissue  care wa taken to reflect any neurovascular structure which were encountered  following this the incision wa deepened down to the level of the periosteum and periosteum wa reflected using the sharp dissection to expose the head of the metatarsal along with the neck region  after adequate exposure of the fifth metatarsal head wa achieved an oblique incision directed from distal lateral to proximal medial in a sagittal plane wa performed and the head of the fifth metatarsal wa shifted medially  following this an orthosorb pin wa retrograded through the fifth metatarsal head into the neck of the fifth metatarsal and wa cut off first with the lateral surface of bone  orthosorb pin wa noted to be intact and the fifth metatarsal head wa in good alignment and position  following this the sagittal saw and the 138 blade were used to provide rasping and smoothing of the sharp acute edge of bone laterally  following this the periosteum wa closed using 40 vicryl and the skin wa closed in layer using 40 vicryl and closed with running subcuticular 40
