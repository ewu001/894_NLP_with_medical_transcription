inspiratory flow limitation compatible with snoring wa observed during nonrem sleepassessment and plan  this patient present with history of sleep disruption and daytime sleepiness with fatigue  her symptom are multifactorialregarding the etiology of difficulty in initiating and maintaining sleep the patient ha a component of psychophysiologic insomnia based on report of better sleep in the laboratory a compared to home  in addition nontrivial smoking in the home setting may be contributing significantly to sleep disruptionregarding her daytime sleepiness the patient is taking a number of longacting central nervous system acting medication to sedate her and can produce a lasting sedation throughout the daytime  these include trazodone seroquel and methadone  of these medication the methadone is clearly indicative given the history of substance abuse  it would be desirable to reduce or discontinue trazodone and then perhaps consider doing the same with seroquel  i brought this possibility up with the patient and i asked her to discus this further with her psychiatristfinally to help mitigate sleep disruption at night i have provided her with tip for sleep hygiene  these include bedtime ritual stimulus control therapy and sleep restriction a well a avoidance of nicotine in the evening hour ,1.0

3487,history of present illness  the patient is a 35yearold woman who report that on the 30th of october 2008 she had a rupture of her membrane at nine month of pregnancy and wa admitted to hospital and wa given an epidural anesthetic  i do not have the record from this hospital admission but apparently the epidural wa administered for approximately 14 to 18 hour  she wa sitting up during the epiduralshe did not notice any difference in her lower extremity at the time she had the epidural however she report that she wa extremely sleepy and may not have been aware of any change in strength or sensation in her lower extremity at that time  she delivered on the 31st of october by cesarean section because she had failed to progress and had pyrexiashe also had a foley catheter placed at that time  on the 1st of november 2008 they began to mobilize her and it wa at that time that she first noticed that she could not walk  she wa aware that she could not move her leg at all and then within a few day she wa aware that she could move toe in the left foot but could not move her right foot at all  since that time there ha been a gradual improvement in strength to the point that she now ha limited movement in her left leg and severely restricted movement in her right leg  she is not able to walk by herself and need assistance to stand  she wa discharged from hospital after the cesarean section on the 3rd of november  unfortunately we do not have the record and we do not know what the discussion wa between the anesthesiologist and the patient at the time of discharge  she wa then seen at abc hospital on november 05 2008  she had an mri scan of her spine which showed no evidence of an abnormality specifically there were no cord change and no evidence of a hematoma  she also had an emg study at that time by dr x which wa abnormal but not diagnostic and this wa repeated again in december  at the present time she also complains of a pressure in both her leg and in her thigh  she complains that her right foot hurt and that she ha some hyperesthesia there  she ha been taking gabapentin to try to reduce the discomfort although she is on a very low dose and the effect is minimal  she ha no symptom in her arm her bowel and bladder function is normal and her bulbar function is normal  there is no problem with her vision swallowing or respiratory functionpast medical

there wa a sensory level to light touch at approximately t7 posteriorly and approximately t9 anteriorly  there wa a range of sensation but clearly there wa a decrease in sensation below this level but not complete loss of sensation  to pain the sensory level is even le clear but appeared to be at about t7 on the right side  in the lower extremity there wa a slight decrease in pin and light touch in the right great toe compared to the left  there wa no evidence of allodynia or hyperesthesia  joint position sense wa mildly reduced in the right toe and normal on the leftcoordination  coordination for rapid alternating movement and fingertonose testing wa normal  coordination could not be tested in the lower extremitiesgait  the patient wa unable to stand and therefore we were unable to test gait or romberg  there wa no evidence of focal back tendernessreview of outside record  i have reviewed the record from abc hospital including the letter from dr y and the emg report dated 12172008 from dr x the emg report show evidence of a lumbosacral polyradiculopathy below approximately t6  the lower extremity sensory response are essentially normal however there is a decrease in the amplitude of the motor response with minimal change in latency  i do have the mri of lumbar spine report from 11062008 with and without contrast  this showed a minimal concentric disc bulge of l4l5 without disc herniation but wa otherwise unremarkable  the patient brought a disc with a most recent mri study however we were unable to open this on our computer  the verbal report is that the study wa unremarkable except for some gadolinium enhancement in the lumbar nerve root  a doppler of the lower extremity showed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis in either lower extremity  chest xray showed some scoliosis on the lumbar spine curve to the left but no evidence of other abnormality  a ct pelvis study performed on november 07 2008 showed some nonspecific fluid in the subcutaneous fat of the back posterior to l4 and l5 level however there were no pelvic mass or other abnormality  we were able to obtain an update of the report from the mri of the lumbar spine with and without contrast dated 12302008  the complete study included the cervical thoracic and lumbar spine  there wa diffuse enhancement of the nerve root of the cauda equina that had increased in enhancement since prior exam in november  it wa also reported that the patient wa given intravenous methylprednisolone and this had had no effect on strength in her lower extremitiesimpression  the patient ha a condition that is temporarily related to the epidural injection she wa given at the end of october 2008 prior to her cesarean section  it appears she became aware of weakness within two day of the administration of the epidural she wa very tired during the epidural and may have missed some change in her neurological function  she wa severely weak in both lower extremity slightly worse on the right than the left  there ha been some interval improvement in her strength since the beginning of november 2008  her emg study from the end of december is most consistent with a lumbosacral polyradiculopathy  the mri finding of gadolinium enhancement in the lumbar nerve root would be most consistent with an inflammatory radiculitis most likely related to the epidural anesthesia or administration of the epidural  there had been no response to iv methylprednisolone given to her at abc  the issue of having a lumbar puncture to look for evidence of inflammatory cell or an elevated protein had been discussed with her at both abc and by myself  the patient did not wish to consider a lumbar puncture because of concern that this might worsen her condition  at the present time she is able to stand with aid but is unable to walk  there is no evidence on her previous emg of a demyelinating neuropathyrecommendations1  the diagnostic issue were discussed with the patient at length  she is informed that this is still early in the course of the problem and that we expect her to show some improvement in her function over the next one to two year although it is unclear a to how much function she will regain2  she is strongly recommended to continue with vigorous physical therapy and to continue with the plan to mobilize her a much a possible with the goal of trying to get her ambulatory  if she is able to walk she will need bilateral afos for her ankle to improve her overall mobility  i am not prescribing these because at the present time she doe not need them3  we discussed increasing the dose of gabapentin  the paresthesia that she ha may indicate that she is actually regaining some sensory function although there is a concern that a recovery continues she may be left with significant neuropathic pain  if this is the case i have advised her to increase her gabapentin dose from 300 mg bid gradually up to 300 mg four time a day and then to 600 mg to 900 mg four time a day  she may need other neuropathic pain medication a needed  she will determine whether her current symptom are significant enough to require this increase in dosage4  the patient will follow up with dr y and his team at abc hospital  she will also continue with physical therapy within the abc system ,2.0

the patient wa unable to stand and therefore gait romberg test and balance could not be assesseddiagnostic study  previous diagnostic study and patient report  there were extensive patient report all of which were reviewed  a previous xray study of the lateral chest performed in october 2008 showed poor inspiration with basilar atelectasis and an infiltrate  an xray of the cervical thoracic and lumbar spine showed some evidence of lumbar spinal stenosis  a cta of the neck with and without contrast performed in november 2008 showed minor stenosis in the left carotid a mild hard and soft plaque in the right carotid with approximately 55 stenosis  the posterior circulation showed a slightly dominant right vertebral artery with no stenosis  there wa no significant stenosis but there wa minor extracranial stenosis noted  an mri of the brain with and without contrast performed in november 2008 showed no evidence of an acute infarct major vascular occlusion and no abnormal enhancement with gadolinium administration  there wa also no significant sinusitis or mastoiditis  this wa an essentially normal brain mri  a cbc performed in january 2009 showed an elevated white cell count of 113 a low red cell count of 343 elevated mch of 324 and the rest of the study wa normal  an electrolyte study performed in january 2009 showed a sodium which wa low at 127 a calcium which wa low at 83 and a low protein of 52 and albumin of 31  the glucose wa 86  tsh performed in january 2009 wa 157 which is within the normal range  vitamin b12 wa greater than a 1000 which is normal and the folate wa 182 which wa normal  a myocardial stress study performed in december 2008 showed normal myocardial perfusion with persantine cardiolite spect  the ecg wa nondiagnostic  there wa normal regional wall motion of the left ventricle  the left ventricular ejection fraction wa 68 which is within the normal range for male  a ct of the lumbar spine without contrast performed in december 2008 showed a broadbased disc bulge at l1l2 l2l3 l3l4 and l4l5  at l5s1 in addition to the broadbased disc bulge there wa also an osteophyte complex and evidence of flavum hypertrophy without canal stenosis  there wa severe bilateral neural foraminal stenosis at l5s1 and moderate neural foraminal stenosis at l1l4  an echocardiogram wa performed in november 2008 and showed mild left atrial enlargement normal left ventricular systolic function mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy scleral degenerative change in the aortic and mitral apparatus mild mitral regurgitation mild tricuspid regurgitation and mild to moderate aortic regurgitationdiagnostic impression  the patient present with a severe neuropathy with marked large fiber sensory a well a motor finding  he is diffusely weak a well a atrophic in all muscle group both in his upper and lower extremity although he is disproportionately weak in his lower extremity  his proprioceptive and vibratory loss is severe in both the distal upper and lower extremity signifying that he either ha a severe sensory neuropathy or ha involvement of the dorsal root ganglion  according to the history which wa carefully checked the initial onset of these symptom go back one and a half year although there ha only been significant progression in his condition since july 2008  a indicated below further diagnostic study including a detailed nerve conduction and emg test today showed evidence of a severe sensory motor and axonal neuropathy and in addition there wa evidence of a diffuse polyradiculopathy  there wa no involvement of the tongue on emg  the laboratory testing a indicated below failed to show a specific cause for the neuropathy  we are still however waiting for the paraneoplastic antibody which were send out lab to the mayo clinic  this type of very severe sensorimotor neuropathy with significant proprioceptive loss may be seen in several condition including peripheral nerve vasculitis due to a variety of disorder such a sle sjogrens rheumatoid arthritis and mixed connective tissue disease  in addition it may also be seen with certain toxin particularly chemotherapeutic agent  the patient did not receive any of these  it may also be seen a part of a paraneoplastic syndrome  although the patient doe not have any specific clinical symptom of a cancer it is noted that he ha had an 18pound weight loss in the past month and doe have a remote history of smoking  we have requested that he obtain a ct of his chest abdomen and pelvis while he is in acute rehabilitation  the verbal report of these possibly did not show any evidence of a cancer  we did also request that he obtain a gallium scan to see if there wa any evidence of an unsuspected neoplasm  the patient did undergo a nerve and muscle biopsy this wa a radial nerve and biceps muscle biopsy from the left arm  this showed evidence of severe axonal loss  there wa no evidence of a vasculitis  the vessel did show some mild intimal change that would be consistent with atherosclerosis  there were a few perivascular change however there wa no clear evidence of a necrotizing vasculitis even on multiple section  the muscle biopsy showed severe muscle fiber atrophy with evidence of fiber grouping  again there wa no evidence of inflammation or vasculitis  evaluation so far ha also shown no evidence of an amyloid neuropathy no evidence of a monoclonal gammopathy of sarcoidosis and again there is no past history of a significant toxin or infective cause for the neuropathy  specifically there is no history of hiv exposure  we would await the result of the gallium scan and of the paraneoplastic antibody to see if these are helpful in making a diagnosis  at this point because of the severity and the axonal nature of the neuropathy there is no specific therapy that will reverse the course of the illness unless we find a specific etiology that can be stopped or reversed  i have discussed these issue at length with the patient and with his son  we also addressed whether or not there might be a previously undiagnosed inherited neuropathy  i think this is unlikely given the short history and the rapid progression of the disorderthere is also no family history that we can detect a neuropathy and the patient doe not have the typical phenotype for a chronic inherited neuropathy such a charcotmarietooth disease type 2  however since i have only seen the patient on one occasion and do not know what his previous examination showed two year ago i cannot be certain that there may not have been the presence of a neuropathy preceding thisplan1  nerve conduction and emg will be performed today  the result were indicated above2  the following laboratory study were requested including electrolyte cbc thyroid function test b12 ana creactive protein complement cryoglobulins doublestranded dna antibody folate level hemoglobin a1c immunofixation electrophoresis panca canca protein electrophoresis rheumatoid factor paraneoplastic antibody study requested from the mayo clinic b12  these study showed minor change which included a low sodium level of 129 a previously noted a low creatinine of 074 low calcium of 86 low total protein of 57  the b12 wa greater than 2000  the immunoelectrophoresis ana doublestranded dna anca hemoglobin a1c folate cryoglobulins complement creactive protein were all normal or negative  the b12 level wa greater than 2000  liver function test were normal  the glucose wa 90  esr wa 10  hemoglobin a1c wa 553  a left radial sensory and left biceps biopsy were requested and have been performed and interpreted a indicated above4  ct of chest abdomen and pelvis5  whole body gallium scan for evidence of an underlying neoplasm6  the patient will go to the rehabilitation facility for acute rehabilitation and training7  we have not made any change to his medication  he doe have some mild orthostatic change however he is adequately controlled with midodrine at a dose of 25 mg three time a day a needed up to 5 mg four time a day  usually he us a lower dose of 25 three time a day to 5 mg three time a day8  followup will be a determined by the family ,1.0

proximal location of the pedicle  placement confirmed with biplanar coaxial fluoroscopy  the awl wa in appropriate location and using a pedicle finder under fluoroscopic control the pedicle wa probed to the mid portion of the body of t11  a 40mm clickx screw 65 mm diameter with rod holder wa then threaded into the t11 vertebral bodyattention wa next turned to the l1 level on the left side and the junction of the transverse process with the superior articular facet and intraarticular process wa located using an am8 dissecting tool am attachment to the midas rex instrumentation  the area wa decorticated an awl wa placed and under fluoroscopic biplanar imaging noted to be at the pedicle in l1  using a pedicle probe the pedicle wa then probed to the mid body of l1 and a 7mm diameter 45mm in length clickx synthes screw with rod holder wa placed in the l1 vertebral bodyat this point an elongated rod wa placed on the left side for purpose of distraction should it be felt necessary in view of the mri finding of significant compression on the patient ventral canal on the right side  attention wa next turned to the right side and it should be noted that the dissection above wa carried out with operating room microscope and at this point the intraspinous process ligament superior to the posterior spinous process at t12 wa noted be completely disrupted on a traumatic basis  the anteroposterior spinous process ligament superior to the t12 wa incised with cutting bovie current and the posterior spinous process at t12 removed with a leksell rongeur  it wa necessary to remove portion of the posterior spinous process at t11 for a full visualization of the involved laminar fracture at t12at this point a laminectomy wa performed using 45degree kerrison rongeur both 2

of breast cancer made five year ago  a year ago she wa diagnosed with cranial metastasis and underwent whole brain radiation  she recently ha deteriorated such that she came to my office unable to ambulate in a wheelchair  metastatic workup doe reveal multiple bone metastasis but no spinal cord compression  she had a consult with radiationoncology that decided they could radiate her metastasis le than 3 cm with stereotactic radiosurgery but the lesion greater than 3 cm needed to be removed  consequently this operation is performedprocedure in detail  the patient underwent a planning mri scan with stealth protocol  she wa brought to the operating room with fiducial still on her scalp  general endotracheal anesthesia wa obtained  she wa placed on the mayfield head holder and rolled into the prone position  she wa well padded secured and so forth  the neck wa flexed so a to expose the right suboccipital region a well a the left and right parietooccipital region  the posterior aspect of the calvarium wa shaved and prepared in the usual manner with betadine soak scrub followed by betadine paint  this wa done only of course after fiducial were registered in planning and an excellent accuracy wa obtained with the stealth system  sterile drape were applied and the accuracy of the system wa confirmed  a biparietal incision wa performed  a linear incision wa chosen so a to increase her chance of successful wound healing and that she is status post whole brain radiation  a biparietal craniotomy wa carried out carrying about 1 cm over toward the right side and about 4 cm over to the left side a guided by the stealth stereotactic system  the dura wa opened and reflected back to the midline  an inner hemispheric approach wa used to reach the very large metastatic tumor  this wa very delicate removing the tumor and the cosurgeons switched off to spare one another during the more delicate part of the operation to remove the tumor  the tumor wa wrapped around and included the choroidal vessel  at least one choroidal vessel wa sacrificed in order to obtain a gross total excision of the tumor on the parietal occipital region  bleeding wa quite vigorous in some of the artery and finally however wa completely controlled  complete removal of the tumor wa confirmed by intraoperative ultrasoundonce the tumor had been removed and meticulous hemostasis wa obtained this wound wa left opened and attention wa turned to the right suboccipital area  a linear incision wa made just lateral to the greater occipital nerve  sharp dissection wa carried down in the subcutaneous tissue and bovie electrocautery wa used to reach the skull  a burr hole wa placed down low using a craniotome  a craniotomy wa turned and then enlarged a a craniectomy to at least 4 cm in diameter  it wa carried caudally to the floor of the posterior fossa and rostrally to the transverse sinus  stealth and ultrasound were used to localize the very large tumor that wa within the horizontal hemisphere of the cerebellum  the ventriculostomy had been placed on the left side with the craniotomy and removal of the tumor and this wa draining csf relieving pressure in the posterior fossa  upon opening the craniotomy in the parietal occipital region the brain wa noted to be extremely tight thus necessitating placement of the ventriculostomyat the posterior fossa a corticectomy wa accomplished and the tumor wa countered directly  the tumor a the one above wa removed both piecemeal and with intraoperative cavitron ultrasonic aspirator  a gross total excision of this tumor wa obtained a welli then explored underneath the cerebellum in hope of finding another metastasis in the cp angle however this wa just over the lower cranial nerve and rather than risk paralysis of pharyngeal muscle and voice a well a possibly hearing loss this lesion wa left alone and to be radiated and that it is le than 3 cm in diametermeticulous hemostasis wa obtained for this wound a

consultation and felt to be a surgical candidate for improvement  risk and benefit of the operation were described to the patient in detail including but not limited to bleeding infection scarring possible damage to surrounding structure including neurovascular structure need for revision of surgery continued asymmetry and anesthetic complication  the patient understood these risk and benefit and consented to the operationprocedure in detail  the patient wa taken to or and placed supine on the operating table  dose of antibiotic wa given to the patient  compression device were placed on the lower extremity to prevent the knee embolic event  the patient wa turned to 180 degree  the ett tube wa secured and the area wa then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion  a head wrap wa then placed on the position and we then began our local  of note the patient had previous incision just lateral to his lateral canthus bilaterally and that were used for access  local consisting a 5050 mix of 025 marcaine with epinephrine and 1 lidocaine with epinephrine wa then injected into the subperiosteal plane taking care to prevent injury to the infraorbital nerve  this wa done bilaterally  we then marked the nasolabial fold and began with the elevation of the left midfacewe began with a lateral canthaltype incision extending out over his previous incision down to subcutaneous tissue  we continued down to the lateral orbital rim until we identified periosteum  we then pulled in a periosteal elevator and elevated the midface down over the zygoma elevating some lateral mesenteric attachment down over the buccal region until we felt we had reached pas the nasolabial fold medially  care wa taken to preserve the infraorbital nerve and that wa visualized after elevation  we then released the periosteum distally and retracted up on the periosteum and noted improved contour of the nasolabial fold with increased bulk over the midface region over the zygomawe then used our endotine coapt device to engage the periosteum at the desired location and then elevated the midface and secured into position using the coapt bioabsorbable screw  after this wa then carried out we then clipped and cut a well a the end of the screw  satisfied with this we then elevated the periosteum and secured it to reinforce our midface elevation to the lateral orbital rim and this wa done using 30 monocryl  several suture were then used to anchor the orbicularis and deeper tissue to create additional symmetry  excess skin along the incision wa then removed a well the skin from just lateral to the canthus  care wa taken to leave the orbicularis muscle down  we then continued closing our incision using absorbable plain gut 50 suture for the subciliarytype incision and then continuing with interrupted 60 prolenes lateral to the canthuswe then turned our attention to performing the zplasty portion of the case  a zplasty wa designed along the previous scar where it wa padding to the notable scar deformity and effacement of crease and the zplasty wa then designed to lengthen along the scar to improve the contour  this wa carried out using a 15 blade down to subcutaneous tissue  the flap were debulked slightly to reduce the amount of fullness and then transposed and sutured into place using chromic suture  at this point we then noted that he had improvement of the nasal fold but continued asymmetry with regard to improved bulk on the left side and le bulk on the right and it wa felt that a symmetrization procedure wa required to make more symmetry with the midface bilaterally and nasolabial fold bilaterally  a such we then carried out the dissection after injecting local a noted and we used a 15 blade scalpel to create our incision along the lateral canthus along it preexisting incision  we carried this down to the lateral orbital rim again elevating the periosteum taking care to preserve infraorbital nerveat this point we then released the periosteum distally just at the level of the nasolabial fold and placed our endotine midface implant into the desired area and then elevated slightly just for symmetry only  this wa then

pain and numbness with decreased range of the middle index finger and right middle finger complaining of catching and locking  the patient wa diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome on bilateral hand the right being worse than the left  he had positive emg finding a well a clinical finding  the patient did undergo an injection which only provided him with temporary relief and is for this reason he ha consented to undergo the abovenamed procedureall risk a well a complication were discussed with the patient and consent wa obtainedprocedure  the patient wa wheeled back to the operating room 1 at abcd general hospital on 082903  he wa placed supine on the operating room table  next a nonsterile tourniquet wa placed on the right forearm but not inflated  at this time 8 cc of 025 marcaine with epinephrine wa instilled into the carpal tunnel region of the volar aspect of the wrist for anesthesia  in addition an additional 2 cc were used on the superficial skin of the volar palm over the a1 pulley of the right index and right middle finger  at this time the extremity wa then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion for this procedure  first we went for release of the carpal tunnel  approximately 25 cm incision wa made over the volar aspect of the wrist over the carpal tunnel region  first dissection through the skin in the superficial fascia wa performed with a selfretractor placed in addition to ragnells retracting proximally and distally  the palmaris brevis muscle wa then identified and sharply transected  at this time we identified the transverse carpal tunnel ligament and a 15 blade wa used to sharply and carefully release that fascia  once the fascia of the transverse carpal ligament wa transected the identification of the median nerve wa visualized  the resection of the ligament wa taken both proximally and distally to assure complete release and it wa checked thoroughly  at this time a neurolysis wa performed and no evidence of spaceoccupying lesion were identified within the carpal tunnel  at this time copious irrigation wa used to irrigate the wound  the wound wa suctioned dry  at this time we proceeded to the release of the a1 pulley  approximately a 15 cm incision wa made over the a1 pulley in the volar aspect of the palm of the right index and right middle finger  first we went for the index finger  once the skin incision wa made metzenbaum scissor wa used to longitudinally dissect the subcutaneous tissue and with ragnell retractor we identified the a1 pulley  a 15 blade wa used to make a longitudinal slit along with a1 pulley and the littler scissors were used to release the a1 pulley proximally a well a distally  once this wa performed a tendon hook wa then used to wrap the tendon and release the tendon both proximally and distally and they were removed from the wound in order to check their integrity  there wa some evidence of synovitis in addition to some fraying of the both the profundus a well a superficialis tendon  once a thorough release wa performed copious irrigation wa used to irrigate that wound  in the similar fashion a 15 cm incision wa made over the volar aspect of the a1 pulley of the right middle finger  a littler scissor wa used to bluntly dissect in the longitudinal fashion  with the ragnell retractor we identified the a1 pulley of the right middle fingerusing a 15 blade the a1 pulley wa scored with the 15 blade and the litter scissor wa used to complete the release of the a1 pulley distally and proximally  we again placed the tendon hook around both the superficialis and the profundus tendon and they were extruded from the wound to check their integrity  again there wa evidence of some synovitis a well a fraying of both tendon  the girth of both tendon and both wound were within normal limit  at this time copious irrigation wa used to irrigate the wound  the patient wa then asked to intraoperatively flex and extend his finger and he wa able to fully flex his finger to make a close fit which he wa not able to do preoperatively  in addition he wa able to abduct his thumb indicating that the recurrent branch of the median nerve wa intact  at this time 50 nylon wa used to approximate in a vertical mattress type fashion both the carpal tunnel incision a well a the both a1 pulley incision of the right middle finger and right index finger  the wound closure took place after the tourniquet wa released and hemostasis wa obtained with bovie cautery  at this time a shortarm splint wa placed on the volar aspect of the wrist after it wa wrapped in a sterile dressing consisting of adaptic and kerlix roll  the patient wa then carefully taken off of the operating room table to recovery in stable condition ,2.0

generaloperative finding  this patient had a 3cm acoustic neuroma  the tumor wa incompletely excised leaving a remnant of the tumor along the cerebellopontine angle portion of the facial nerve  the facial nerve wa stimulated at the brainstem at 005 milliampere at the conclusion of the dissectionsprocedure in detail  following induction of adequate general anesthetic the patient wa positioned for surgery  she wa placed in a lateral position and her head wa maintained with mayfield pin  the left periauricular area wa shaved prepped and draped in the sterile fashion  transdermal electrode for continuous facial nerve emg monitoring were placed and no response wa verified  the proposed incision wa injected with 1 xylocaine with epinephrine  next tshaped incision wa made approximately 5 cm behind the postauricular crease  the incision wa undermined at the level of temporalis fascia and the portion of the fascia wa harvested for further useincision wa made along the inferior aspect of the temporalis muscle and then extended inferiorly over the mastoid tip  periosteal elevator wa used to elevate periosteum in order to expose the mastoid and anterior aspect of the occipital bone  emissary vein posterior to the sigmoid sinus were controlled with electrocautery and bone wax  bergen retractor were used to maintain exposure  using a cutting bur with continuous suction and irrigation of craniotomy wa performed  the sigmoid sinus wa identified anteriorly and the transverse site were identified superiorly  from these structure approximately 4 x 4 cm a window of bone wa removed  bone shaving were collected during the dissection and placed in siloxane suspension for later use  the bone flap wa also left at the site for further use  dissection wa extended along the inferior aspect of the sigmoid sinus to provide additional exposure of the skull base  bone wax wa used to occlude air cell lateral to the sigmoid sinus  there wa extensively aerated temporal bone  at this point dr trask entered the case in order to open the dura and expose the tumor  the cerebellum wa retracted away from the tumor and the retractor wa placed to help maintain exposure  once initial exposure wa completed attention wa directed to the posterior aspect of the temporal bone  the dura wa excised from around the porous acusticus extending posteriorly along the bone  then using diamond bur the internal auditory canal wa dissected out  the bone wa removed laterally for distance of approximately 8 mm  there wa considerable aeration around the internal auditory canal a well  the dura wa then incised over the internal auditory canal exposing the intracanalicular portion of the tumor  the tumor extended all the way to the fundus such that initial exposure of the facial nerve around the tumor wa difficult  therefore dr trask returned in order to further release the tumor from the brainstem and to debulk the central portion of the tumor  with dissection he released the tumor from the trigeminal nerve superiorly and elevated the tumor away from the dorsal brainstem  the eighth nerve wa identified and transected  tumor debulking allowed for retraction of the tumor capsule away from the brainstem  the facial nerve wa difficult to identify at the brainstem a well  it wa identified by using an electrical stimulator but dissection attempted at this time wa the plane between the nerve and the tumor proximally but this wa difficult to achieve  attention wa then redirected to the internal auditory canal where this portion of the tumor wa removed  the superior and inferior vestibular nerve were evulsed laterally and dissection proceeded along the facial nerve to the porous acusticus  at this point plane of dissection wa again indistinct  the tumor had been released from the porous and could be rotated  the tumor wa further debulked and thinned but could not crucially visualize the nerve on the anterior face of the tumor  the nerve could be stimulated but wa quite splayed over the anterior face  further debulking of the tumor proceeded and additional attempt were made to establish point of dissection along the nerve both proximally and distally  however the cerebellopontine angle portion of the nerve wa not usually delineated  however the tumor wa then thinned using cusa down to fine sheath measuring only about 1 to 2 mm in thickness  it wa released from the brainstem ventrally  the tumor wa then cauterized with bipolar electrocautery  the facial nerve wa stimulated at the brainstem and stimulated easily at 005 milliampere  overall the remaining tumor volume would be of small percentage of the original volume  at this point dr trask reinspected the posterior fossa to ensure complete hemostasis  the air cell around the internal auditory canal were packed off with muscle and bone wax  a piece of fascia wa then laid over the bone defect  next the dura wa closed with duragen and duraseal  the bone flap and bone  were then placed in the bone defect  postauricular musculature wa then reapproximated using interrupted 30 vicryl suture  the skin wa also closed using interrupted subdermal 30 vicryl suture  running 40 nylon suture wa placed at the skin level  sterile mastoid dressing wa then placed  the patient tolerated the procedure well and wa transported to the pacu in a stable condition  all count were correct at the conclusion of the

adequate sedation wa achieved by the anesthesia team the abovementioned anesthetic mixture wa infiltrated directly into the patient right foot to anesthetize the future surgical site  the right ankle wa then covered with cast padding and an 18inch ankle tourniquet wa placed around the right ankle and set at 250 mmhg  the right ankle tourniquet wa then inflated  the right foot wa prepped scrubbed and draped in normal sterile technique  attention wa then directed on the dorsal aspect of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint where a 6cm linear incision wa placed just parallel and medial to the course of the extensor hallucis longus to the right great toe  the incision wa deepened through the subcutaneous tissue  all the bleeder were identified cut clamped and cauterized  the incision wa deepened to the level of the capsule and the periosteum of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint  all the tendinous and neurovascular structure were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved  using sharp and dull dissection all the capsular and periosteal attachment were mobilized from the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe and head of the first right metatarsal  once the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe and the first right metatarsal head were adequately exposed multiple osteophyte were encountered  gouty tophus were encountered both intraarticularly and periarticularly for the first right metatarsophalangeal joint which were consistent with a medical history that is positive for gout for this patientusing sharp and dull dissection all the ligamentous and soft tissue attachment were mobilized and the right first metatarsophalangeal joint wa freed from all adhesion  using the sagittal saw all the osteophyte were removed from the dorsal medial and lateral aspect of the first right metatarsal head a well a the dorsal medial and lateral aspect of the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe  although some improvement of the range of motion wa encountered after the removal of the osteophyte some tightness and restriction wa still present  the decision wa thus made to perform a youngswicktype osteotomy on the head of the first right metatarsal  the osteotomy consistent of two dorsal cut and a plantar cut in a vpattern with the apex of the osteotomy distal and the base of the osteotomy proximal  the two dorsal cut were longer than the plantar cut in order to accommodate for the future internal fixation  the wedge of bone that wa formed between the two dorsal cut wa resected and passed off to pathology for further examination  the head of the first right metatarsal wa then impacted on the shaft of the first right metatarsal and provisionally stabilized with two wire from the osteomed system  the wire were inserted from a dorsal distal to plantar proximal direction through the dorsal osteotomy  the wire were also used a guidewires for the insertion of two 16mm proximally threaded cannulated screw from the osteomed system  the 2 screw were inserted using ao technique  upon insertion of the screw the two wire were removed  fixation of the osteotomy on the table wa found to be excellent  the area wa copiously flushed with saline and range of motion wa reevaluated and wa found to be much improved from the preoperative level without any significant restriction  the cartilaginous surface on the base of the first right metatarsal and the base of the proximal phalanx were also fenestrated in order to induce some cartilaginous formation  the capsule and periosteal tissue were then reapproximated with 30 vicryl suture material 40 vicryl wa used to approximate the subcutaneous tissue  steristrips were used to approximate and reinforce the skin edge  at this time the right ankle tourniquet wa deflated  immediate hyperemia wa noted in the entire right lower extremity upon deflation of the cuff  the patient surgical site wa then covered with xeroform copious amount of fluff and kling stockinette and ace bandage  the patient right foot wa placed in a surgical shoe and the patient wa then transferred to the recovery room under the care of the anesthesia

adhesion to the left fallopian tube and the right fallopian tube  there wa a copious amount of blood in the abdomen approximately 2 liter of clotted and unclotted blood  there wa some questionable gestational tissue  on the left sacrospinous ligament  there wa an apparent rupture and bleeding ectopic pregnancy in the isthmus portion of the right fallopian tubeprocedure  after an informed consent wa obtained the patient wa taken to the operating room and the general anesthetic wa administered  she wa then positioned in the dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion  once the anesthetic wa found to be adequate a bimanual exam wa performed under anesthetic  a weighted speculum wa then placed in the vagina  the interior wall of vagina elevated with the uterine sound and the anterior lip of the cervix wa grasped with the vulsellum tenaculum  the cervix wa then serially dilated with hank dilator to a size 20 hank and then a sharp curettage wa performed obtaining a moderate amount of decidual appearing tissue and the tissue wa then sent to pathology  at this point the uterine manipulator wa placed in the cervix and attached to the anterior cervix and vulsellum tenaculum and weighted speculum were removed  next attention wa then turned to the abdomen  the surgeon all are removed the dirty glove in the previous portion of the case  next a 2 cm incision wa made immediately inferior to umbilicus  the superior aspect of the umbilicus wa grasped with a towel clamp and a veress needle wa inserted through this incision  next a syringe wa used to inject normal saline into the veress needle  the normal saline wa seen to drop freely so a veress needle wa connected to the co2 gas which wa started at it lowest setting  the gas wa seen to flow freely with normal resistance so the co2 gas wa advanced to a higher setting  the abdomen wa insufflated to an adequate distension  once an adequate distention wa reached the co2 gas wa disconnected  the veress needle wa removed and a size 11 step trocar wa placed  the introducer wa removed and the trocar wa connected to the co2 gas and a camera wa inserted  next a 1 cm incision wa made in the midline approximately two fingerbreadth below the pubic symphysis after transilluminating with the camera  a veress needle and a step sheath were inserted through this incision  next the veress needle wa removed and a size 5 trocar wa inserted under direct visualization  next a size 5 port wa placed approximately five fingerbreadth to the left of the umbilicus in a similar fashion  a size 12 port wa placed in a similar fashion approximately six fingerbreadth to the right of the umbilicus and also under direct visualization  the laparoscopic dissector wa inserted through the suprapubic port and this wa used to dissect the omental adhesion bluntly from the vesicouterine peritoneum and the bilateral fallopian tube  next the dorsey suction irrigator wa used to copiously irrigate the abdomen  approximate total of 3 liter of irrigation wa used and the majority of all blood clot and free blood wa removed from the abdomenonce the majority of blood wa cleaned from the abdomen the ectopic pregnancy wa easily identified and the end of the fallopian tube wa grasped with the grasper from the left upper quadrant and the ligasure device wa then inserted through the right upper quadrant with  12 port  three bite with the ligasure device were used to transect the mesosalpinx inferior to the fallopian tube and then transect the fallopian tube proximal to the ectopic pregnancy  an endocatch bag wa then placed to the size 12 port and this wa used to remove the right fallopian tube and ectopic pregnancy  this wa then sent to the pathology  next the right mesosalpinx and remains of the fallopian tube were examined again and they were seemed to be hemostatic  the abdomen wa further irrigated  the liver wa examined and appeared to be within normal limit  at this point the two size 5 port and a size 12 port were removed under direct visualization  the camera wa then removed  the co2 gas wa disconnected and the abdomen wa desufflated  the introducer wa then

741,preoperative diagnosis  left acoustic neuromapostoperative diagnosis  left acoustic neuromaprocedure performed  left retrosigmoid craniotomy and excision of acoustic neuromaanesthesia  generaloperative finding  this patient had a 3cm acoustic neuroma  the tumor wa incompletely excised leaving a remnant of the tumor along the cerebellopontine angle portion of the facial nerve  the facial nerve wa stimulated at the brainstem at 005 milliampere at the conclusion of the dissectionsprocedure in detail  following induction of adequate general anesthetic the patient wa positioned for surgery  she wa placed in a lateral position and her head wa maintained with mayfield pin  the left periauricular area wa shaved prepped and draped in the sterile fashion  transdermal electrode for continuous facial nerve emg monitoring were placed and no response wa verified  the proposed incision wa injected with 1 xylocaine with epinephrine  next tshaped incision wa made approximately 5 cm behind the postauricular crease  the incision wa undermined at the level of temporalis fascia and the portion of the fascia wa harvested for further useincision wa made along the inferior aspect of the temporalis muscle and then extended inferiorly over the mastoid tip  periosteal elevator wa used to elevate periosteum in order to expose the mastoid and anterior aspect of the occipital bone  emissary vein posterior to the sigmoid sinus were controlled with electrocautery and bone wax  bergen retractor were used to maintain exposure  using a cutting bur with continuous suction and irrigation of craniotomy wa performed  the sigmoid sinus wa identified anteriorly and the transverse site were identified superiorly  from these structure approximately 4 x 4 cm a window of bone wa removed  bone shaving were collected during the dissection and placed in siloxane suspension for later use  the bone flap wa also left at the site for further use  dissection wa extended along the inferior aspect of the sigmoid sinus to provide additional exposure of the skull base  bone wax wa used to occlude air cell lateral to the sigmoid sinus  there wa extensively aerated temporal bone  at this point dr trask entered the case in order to open the dura and expose the tumor  the cerebellum wa retracted away from the tumor and the retractor wa placed to help maintain exposure  once initial exposure wa completed attention wa directed to the posterior aspect of the temporal bone  the dura wa excised from around the porous acusticus extending posteriorly along the bone  then using diamond bur the internal auditory canal wa dissected out  the bone wa removed laterally for distance of approximately 8 mm  there wa considerable aeration around the internal auditory canal a well  the dura wa then incised over the internal auditory canal exposing the intracanalicular portion of the tumor  the tumor extended all the way to the fundus such that initial exposure of the facial nerve around the tumor wa difficult  therefore dr trask returned in order to further release the tumor from the brainstem and to debulk the central portion of the tumor  with dissection he released the tumor from the trigeminal nerve superiorly and elevated the tumor away from the dorsal brainstem  the eighth nerve wa identified and transected  tumor debulking allowed for retraction of the tumor capsule away from the brainstem  the facial nerve wa difficult to identify at the brainstem a well  it wa identified by using an electrical stimulator but dissection attempted at this time wa the plane between the nerve and the tumor proximally but this wa difficult to achieve  attention wa then redirected to the internal auditory canal where this portion of the tumor wa removed  the superior and inferior vestibular nerve were evulsed laterally and dissection proceeded along the facial nerve to the porous acusticus  at this point plane of dissection wa again indistinct  the tumor had been released from the porous and could be rotated  the tumor wa further debulked and thinned but could not crucially visualize the nerve on the anterior face of the tumor  the nerve could be stimulated but wa quite splayed over the anterior face  further debulking of the tumor proceeded and additional attempt were made to establish point of dissection along the nerve both proximally and distally  however the cerebellopontine angle portion of the nerve wa not usually delineated  however the tumor wa then thinned using cusa down to fine sheath measuring only about 1 to 2 mm in thickness  it wa released from the brainstem ventrally  the tumor wa then cauterized with bipolar electrocautery  the facial nerve wa stimulated at the brainstem and stimulated easily at 005 milliampere  overall the remaining tumor volume would be of small percentage of the original volume  at this point dr trask reinspected the posterior fossa to ensure complete hemostasis  the air cell around the internal auditory canal were packed off with muscle and bone wax  a piece of fascia wa then laid over the bone defect  next the dura wa closed with duragen and duraseal  the bone flap and bone  were then placed in the bone defect  postauricular musculature wa then reapproximated using interrupted 30 vicryl suture  the skin wa also closed using interrupted subdermal 30 vicryl suture  running 40 nylon suture wa placed at the skin level  sterile mastoid dressing wa then placed  the patient tolerated the procedure well and wa transported to the pacu in a stable condition  all count were correct at the conclusion of the

laparoscopic finding demonstrated a 8 cm x 10 cm smooth right ovarian cyst that wa noted to be torsed twice  otherwise the uterus left tube and ovary bowel liver margin appendix and gallbladder were noted all to be within normal limit  there wa no noted blood in the pelvisindications for this procedure  the patient is a 26yearold g1 p1 who presented to abcd general emergency room with complaint of right lower quadrant pain since last night which ha been increasing in intensity  the pain persisted despite multiple pain medication given in the emergency room  the patient report positive nausea and vomiting  there wa no vaginal bleeding or discharge  there wa no fever or chill  her culture done in the emergency room were pending  the patient did have an ultrasound that demonstrated an 8 cm right ovarian cyst questionable hemorrhagic  the uterus and left ovary were within normal limit  there wa a positive flow noted to bilateral ovary on ultrasound  therefore it wa felt appropriate to take the patient for a diagnostic laparoscopy with a possible oophorectomyprocedure  after informed consent wa obtained and all question were answered to the patient satisfaction in layman term she wa taken to the operating room where general anesthesia wa obtained without any difficulty  she wa placed in dorsal lithotomy position with the use of allis strip and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion  her bladder wa drained with a red robinson catheter and she wa examined under anesthesia and wa noted to have the finding a above  she wa prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion  a weighted speculum wa placed in the patient vagina with excellent visualization of the cervix  the cervix wa grasped at 12 oclock position with a singletoothed tenaculum and pulled into the operative field  the uterus wa then sounded to approximately 35 inch and then a uterine elevator wa placed  the vulsellum tenaculum wa removed  the weighted speculum wa removed  attention wa then turned to the abdomen where 1 cm infraumbilical incision wa made in the infraumbilical fold  the veress step needle wa then placed into the abdomen while the abdomen wa being tented up with towel clamp  the co2 wa then turned on with unoccluded flow and excellent pressure  this wa continued till a normal symmetrical pneumoperitoneum wa obtained  then a 11 mm step trocar and sleeve were placed into the infraumbilical port without any difficulty and placement wa confirmed by laparoscope  laparoscopic finding are a noted above  a suprapubic incision wa made with the knife and then a 12 mm step trocar and sleeve were placed in the suprapubic region under direct visualization  then a grasper wa used to untorse the ovary  then a 12 mm port wa placed in the right flank region under direct visualization using a ligasure vessel sealing system  the right tube and ovary were amputated and noted to be hemostatic  the endocatch bag wa then placed through the suprapubic port and the ovary wa placed into the bag  the ovary wa too large to fit completely into the bag  therefore a laparoscopic needle with a 60 cc syringe wa used to aspirate the content of the ovary while it wa still inside the bagthere wa approximately 200 cc of fluid aspirated from the cyst  this wa a clear yellow fluid  then the bag wa closed and the ovary wa removed from the suprapubic port  the suprapubic port did have to be extended somewhat to allow for the removal of the ovary  the trocar and sleeve were then placed back into the port  the abdomen wa copiously irrigated with warm normal saline using the nezhatdorsey suction irrigator and the incision site wa noted to be hemostatic  the pelvis wa clear and clean  picture were obtained  the suprapubic port wa then removed under direct visualization and then using a 0vicyrl and ur6  two figureofeight suture were placed in the fascia of suprapubic port and fascia wa closed and the pneumoperitoneum wa maintained after the suture were placed  therefore the peritoneal surface wa noted to be hemostatic  therefore the camera wa removed  all instrument were removed  the abdomen wa allowed to completely deflate and then the trocars were placed back through the sleeve of the right flank 12 port and the infraumbilical port and these were removed  the infraumbilical port wa examined and noted to have a small fascial defect which wa repaired with 0vicryl and ur6  the right flank area wa palpated and there wa no facial defect noted  the skin wa then closed with 40 undyed vicryl in subcuticular fashion  dressing were changed  the weighted speculum wa removed from the patient cervix  the cervix noted to be hemostatic  the patient tolerated the procedure well  sponge lap and needle count were correct x2 and the patient wa taken to the

present illness  the patient is a 52yearold male who is here for independent medical evaluation  the patient state that he work for abc abc a a temporary worker  he worked for abcd too  the patient main job wa loading and unloading furniture and appliance for the home  the patient wa approximately there for about two and a half week  date of injury occurred back in october  the patient stating that he had history of previous back problem ongoing however he state that on this particular day back in october he wa unloading an 18wheeler at abc and he wa bending down picking up box to unload and load  unfortunately at this particular event the patient had sharp pain in his lower back  soon afterwards he had radiating symptom down his right buttock all the way down to the lateral part of his leg crossing his knee  this became progressively worse  he also state that some of his radiating pain went down to his left leg a well  he noticed increase in buttock spasm and also noticed spasm in his buttock  he initially saw dr z and wa provided with some muscle relaxer and wa given some pain patch or lidoderm patch i believe  the patient state that after this treatment his symptom still persisted  at this point the patient later on wa referred to dr xyz through the workman comp and he wa initially evaluated back in april  after the evaluation the patient wa sent for mri wa provided with pain medication such a shortacting opioids  he wa put on restricted duty  the mri essentially came back negative but the patient continued to have radiating symptom down to his lower extremity and subsequently the patient wa essentially released by dr xyz in june with maximum medical improvementunfortunately the patient continued to have persistence of back pain and radiating symptom down to his leg and went back to see dr xyz again and at this point the patient wa provided with further medication management and sent for pain clinic referral  the patient also wa recommended for nerve block at this point and the patient received epidural steroid injection by dr abc without any significant relief  the patient also wa sent for emg and nerve conduction study which wa performed by dr abcd and the mri emg and nerve conduction study came back essentially negative for radiculopathy which wa performed by dr abcd  the patient state that he continues to have pain with extended sitting he ha radiating symptom down to his lower extremity on the right side of his leg increase in pain with stooping  he ha difficulty sleeping at nighttime because of increase in pain  ultimately the patient wa returned back to work in june and deemed with maximum medical improvement back in june  the patient unfortunately still ha significant degree of back pain with activity such a stooping and radicular symptom down his right leg worse than the left side  the patient also went to see dr x who is a chiropractic specialist and received eight or nine visit of chiropractic care without longterm relief in his overall radicular symptomsphysical examination  the patient wa examined with the gown on  lumbar flexion wa moderately decreased  extension wa normal  side bending to the right wa decreased  side bending to the left wa within normal limit  rotation and extension to the right side wa causing increasing pain  extension and side bending to the left wa within normal limit without significant pain on the left side  while seated straight leg wa negative on the lle at 90° and also negative on the rle at 90°  there wa no true root tension sign or radicular symptom upon straight leg raising in the seated position  in supine position straight leg wa negative in the lle and also negative on the rle  sensory exam show there wa a decrease in sensation to the s1 dermatomal distribution on the right side to light touch and at all other dermatomal distribution wa within normal limit  deep tendon reflex at the patella wa 24 bilaterally but there wa a decrease in reflex in the achilles tendon 14 on the right side and essentially 24 on the left side  medial hamstring reflex wa 24 on both hamstring a well  on prone position there wa tightness in the paraspinals and erector spinae muscle a well a tightness on the right side of the quadratus lumborum area right side wa worse than the left side  increase in pain at deep palpatory examination in midline of the l5 and s1 levelmedical record review  i had the opportunity to review dr xyzs medical record  also reviewed dr abc procedural note which wa the epidural steroid injection block that wa performed in december  also reviewed dr x medical record note and an emg and nerve study that wa performed by dr abcd which wa essentially normal  the mri of the lumbar spine that wa performed back in april which showed no evidence of herniated discdiagnosis  residual from low back injury with right lumbar radicular symptomatologyevaluationrecommendation  the patient ha an impairment based on ama guide fifth edition and it is permanent  the patient appears to have reaggravation of the low back injury back in october related to his work at abc when he wa working unloading and loading an 18wheel truck  essentially there wa a clear aggravation of his symptom with ongoing radicular symptom down to his lower extremity mainly on the right side more so than the left  the patient also ha increase in back pain with lumbar flexion and rotational movement to the right side  with these ongoing symptom the patient ha also decrease in activity of daily living such a mobility a well a decrease in sleep pattern and general decrease in overall function  therefore the patient is assigned 8 impairment of the whole person  we are able to assign this utilizing the fifth edition on spine section on the ama guide  using page 384 table 153 the patient doe fall under dre lumbar category ii under criterion for rating impairment due to lumbar spine injury  in this particular section it state that the patient clinical history and examination finding are compatible with specific injury and finding may include significant muscle guarding or spasm observed at the time of examination a symmetric loss of range of motion or nonverifiable radicular complaint define his complaint of radicular pain without objective finding no alteration of the structural integrity and no significant radiculopathy  the patient also ha decrease in activity of daily living therefore the patient is assigned at the higher impairment rating of 8 wpi  in the future the patient should avoid prolonged walking standing stooping squatting hip bending climbing excessive flexion extension and rotation of his back  his one time weight limit should be determined by work trial although the patient should continue to be closely monitored and managed for his pain control by the specific specialist for management of his overall pain  the patient although ha a clear low back pain with certain movement such a stooping and extended sitting and doe have a clear radicular symptomatology the patient also should be monitored closely for specific dependency to shortacting opioids in the near future by specialist who could monitor and closely follow his overall pain management  the patient also should be treated with appropriate modality and appropriate rehabilitation in the near future ,2.0

ha had a history of a t3 squamous cell carcinoma of his glottic larynx having elected to undergo a laser excision procedure in late 0607  subsequently biopsy confirmed tumor persistence in the right glottic region  risk benefit and alternative of the surgical intervention versus possibility of chemoradiation therapy were discussed with the patient in detail  also concerned for a ct scan finding of possible cartilaginous invasion at the cricoid level  the patient understood the issue regarding surgical intervention and wished to undergo a surgical intervention despite a clear understanding of risk benefit and alternative  he wa accompanied by his wife and daughter  risk included but were not limited to anesthesia bleeding infection injury of the nerve including lower lip weakness tongue weakness tongue numbness shoulder weakness need for physical therapy possibility of total laryngectomy possibility of inability to speak or swallow difficulty eating wound care issue failure to heal need for additional treatment and the patient understood all of these issue and they wished to proceedpreop diagnosis  squamous cell carcinoma of the larynxpostop diagnosis  squamous cell carcinoma of the larynxprocedure detail  after identifying the patient the patient wa placed supine on the operating room table  after the establishment of the general anesthesia via oral endotracheal intubation the patient had his eye protected with tegaderm  a 6 endotracheal tube wa placed initially  direct laryngoscopy wa performed with a lindholm laryngoscope  a 0degree endoscope wa used to take picture of what wa apparently a recurrence of tumor along the right true vocal fold extending into the anterior arytenoid area and extending about 1 cm below into the subglottis  subsequently a decision wa then made to go ahead and perform the surgical intervention  a hemiapron incision wa employed and 1 lidocaine with 1100000 epinephrine wa injected  a shoulder roll wa applied after the patient wa prepped and draped in a sterile fashion  subsequently a hemiapron incision wa performed  subplatysmal flap were raised at the hyoid bone into the clavicle  attention wa then turned to the right side where a level 2 3 4 neck dissection wa performed  submandibular fascia wa appreciated inferiorly along the submandibular gland this wa incised allowing for identification of the digastric muscle  digastric tunnel wa performed posteriorly to the level of the sternocleidomastoid muscle  the fascia along the sternocleidomastoid muscle wa then dissected along the anterior aspect until the cranial nerve xi wa identified  level 2a content were then dissected off the floor of the neck including level 3 and 4  preservation of the phrenic nerve wa obtained by identification and subsequently crossclamping fibrofatty tissue and lymph node just adjacent to the jugular vein inferiorly at level 4  the specimen wa then mobilized over the internal jugular vein with preservation of hypoglossal nerve  level 2 3 4 neck dissection specimen were then labeled appropriately attached with staple and sent for histopathological evaluationattention wa then turned to attempting to perform a partial laryngectomy up front with a possibility of total laryngectomy a discussed  subsequently the strap muscle were separated in the midline  the trachea wa identified in the midline  the thyroid isthmus wa plicated using the harmonic scalpel and attention wa then turned to transecting the strap muscle at the superior aspect of the thyroid cartilage  once this wa performed sinus were mobilized from the thyroid cartilage both on the right and left side respectively  the cricothyroid joint wa then freed on the left side and then on the right side with noting on the right side that this cartilage wa a bit more irregular  attention wa then turned to performing a cricothyrotomy  upon performing this it wa obvious that there wa tumor just above the level of the cricothyrotomy incision  a 7 anode tube wa then placed in this area and secured  attention wa then turned to performing the laryngotomy at the level of the petiole of epiglottis  subsequently the cut were made on the left side with visualization of the vocalis process and coming down to the level of the cricoid cartilage and the thyroid cartilage wa then intentionally fractured along the anterior spine  it wa evident that this tumor had extended more than 1 cm into the subglottic region  careful dissection of larynx from an inferior margin and portion of cricoid cartilage resection then wa performed posteriorly though it wa evident that the cricoid cartilage wa invaded  frozen section biopsy then confirmed this finding a read by dr x of surgical pathologyin light of this finding with cartilaginous invasion and inability to preserve the cricoid cartilage the patient case wa then converted into a total laryngectomy  subsequently the trachea wa transected at the level 3 4 tracheal ring into cartilaginous space and anterior tracheal stoma wa fashioned using 30 vertical mattress suture for the skin  a wplasty wa also performed to allow for enlargement of the stoma  attention wa then turned to identifying the common parting wall of the trachea and the esophagus  attention wa then turned to resecting the hyoid bone  the remainder of the specimen cut were made superior from sinus preserving a modest amount of pharyngeal mechanism  the wound wa copiously irrigated  subsequently a tracheoesophageal puncture site wa performed using a rightangled hemostat at about approximately 1 cm from the posterior tracheal wall superior aspect  once this wa performed a running 30 canal stitch wa used to close the pharynx  subsequently interrupted 40 chromic stitch were then used a reinforcement line from superior to inferior and fibrin glue wa applied  two 10 jp drain were placed on the right side and one on the left side and secured appropriately with 30 nylon  the wound wa then closed using

along the marginal mandibular nerve and into the parotid gland were then dissected and incorporated into the specimen for histopathologic analysis  the marginal mandibular nerve stimulated at the completion of this portion of the procedure  attention wa then turned to incising the fascia along the clavicle on the left side  dissection then ensued along the floor of the neck palpating a very large bulky lymph node before the neck wa identified  the brachial plexus and phrenic nerve were identified  the internal jugular vein identified and the mass wa freed from the floor of the neck with careful dissection and suture ligation of vessel  attention wa then turned to the central neck  the strap muscle were appreciated in the midline  there wa a large firm mass measuring approximately 3 cm that appeared to be superior to the strap musculature  a careful dissection with incorporation of a portion of the sternal hyoid muscle in this area for a margin wa then performed  attention wa then turned to identify the carotid artery and the internal jugular vein on the left side  this wa traced inferiorly internal jugular vein to the brachiocephalic vein  palpation deep to this area into the mediastinum and up against the trachea revealed a 15 cm lymph node mass  subsequently this wa carefully dissected preserving the brachiocephalic vein and also the integrity of the trachea and the carotid artery and these lymph node were removed in full and sent for histopathologic analysis  attention wa then turned to the right neck dissection  a posterior flap on the right wa raised to the anterior border of the trapezius  the accessory nerve wa identified in the posterior triangle and traced superiorly and inferiorly  attention wa then turned to identifying the submandibular gland  a digastric tunnel wa performed back to the sternocleidomastoid muscle  the fascia overlying the sternocleidomastoid muscle on the right side wa incised and the omohyoid muscle wa appreciated  the omohyoid muscle wa retracted inferiorly  penrose drain wa placed around the inferior aspect of the sternocleidomastoid muscle  subsequently the internal jugular vein wa identified  the external jugular vein ligated about 1 cm above the clavicle  palpation in this area and the infraclavicular region on the right revealed a firm irregular lymph node complex  dissection along the floor of the neck then wa performed to allow for mobilization  the transverse cervical artery and vein were individually ligated to allow full mobilization of this mass  tissue between the phrenic nerve and the internal jugular vein wa clamped and suture ligated  the tissue wa then brought posteriorly from the trapezius muscle to the internal jugular vein and traced superiorly  the cervical rootlet were transected after the contribution so the phrenic nerve all the way superiorly to the skull base  the hypoglossal nerve wa identified and protected a the lymph node packet wa dissected over the internal jugular vein  the wound wa copiously irrigated  valsalva maneuver wa given  no bleeding point identified  the wound wa then prepared for closure  two number 10 jps were placed through the left supraclavicular fossa in the previous drain site and secured with 30 nylon  the wound wa closed  with interrupted 30 vicryl for platysma subsequently a 40 running biosyn for the skin and indermil

performed  laparoscopy laparotomy cholecystectomy with operative cholangiogram choledocholithotomy with operative choledochoscopy and ttube drainage of the common bile ductanesthesia  generalindications  this is a 63yearold white male patient with multiple medical problem including hypertension diabetes endstage renal disease coronary artery disease and the patient is on hemodialysis who ha had recurrent episode of epigastric right upper quadrant pain  the patient wa found to have cholelithiasis on last admission  he wa being worked up for this including cardiac clearance  however in the interim he returned again with another episode of same pain  the patient had a hida scan done yesterday which show nonvisualization of the gallbladder consistent with cystic duct obstruction  because of these laparoscopic cholecystectomy wa advised with cholangiogram  possibility of open laparotomy and open procedure wa also explained to the patient  the procedure indication risk and alternative were discussed with the patient in detail and informed consent wa obtaineddescription of procedure  the patient wa put in supine position on the operating table under satisfactory general anesthesia  the entire abdomen wa prepped and draped  a small transverse incision wa made about 212 inch above the umbilicus in the midline under local anesthesia  the patient ha a rather long torso  fascia wa opened vertically and stay suture were placed in the fascia  peritoneal cavity wa carefully entered  hasson cannula wa inserted into the peritoneal cavity and it wa insufflated with co2  laparoscopic camera wa inserted and examination at this time showed difficult visualization with a part of omentum and hepatic flexure of the colon stuck in the subhepatic area  the patient wa placed in reverse trendelenburg and rotated to the left  an 11mm trocar wa placed in the subxiphoid space and two 5mm in the right subcostal region  slowly the dissection wa carried out in the right subhepatic area  initially i wa able to dissect some of the omentum and hepatic flexure off the undersurface of the liver  then some inflammatory change were noted with some fatty necrosis type of change and it wa not quite clear whether this wa part of the gallbladder or it wa just pericholecystic infectioninflammation  the visualization wa extremely difficult because of the patient obesity and a lot of fat intraabdominally although his abdominal wall is not that thick  after evaluating this for a little while we decided that there wa no way that this could be done laparoscopically and proceeded with formal laparotomy  the trocars were removeda right subcostal incision wa made and peritoneal cavity wa entered  a bookwalter retractor wa put in place  the dissection wa then carried out on the undersurface of the liver  eventually the gallbladder wa identified which wa markedly scarred down and shrunk and appeared to have palpable stone in it  dissection wa further carried down to what wa felt to be the common bile duct which appeared to be somewhat larger than normal about a centimeter in size  the duodenum wa kocherized  the gallbladder wa partly intrahepatic  because of this i decided not to dig it out of the liver bed causing further bleeding and problem  the inferior wall of the gallbladder wa opened and two large stone one wa about 3 cm long and another one about 15 x 2 cm long were taken out of the gallbladderit wa difficult to tell where the cystic duct wa  eventually after probing near the neck of the gallbladder i did find the cystic duct which wa relatively very short  intraoperative cystic duct cholangiogram wa done using carm fluoroscopy  this showed a rounded density at the lower end of the bile duct consistent with the stone  at this time a decision wa made to proceed with common duct exploration  the common duct wa opened between stay suture of 40 vicryl and immediately essentially clear bile came out  after some pressing over the head of the pancreas through a kocherized maneuver the stone did fall into the opening in the common bile duct  so it wa about a 1cm size stone which wa removed  following this a 10french red rubber catheter wa passed into the common bile duct both proximally and distally and irrigated generously  no further stone were obtained  the catheter went easily into the duodenum through the ampulla of vater  at this point a choledochoscope wa inserted and proximally i did not see any evidence of any common duct stone or proximally into the biliary tree  however a stone wa found distally still floating around  this wa removed with stone forceps  the bile duct were irrigated again  no further stone were removed  a 16french ttube wa then placed into the bile duct and the bile duct wa repaired around the ttube using 40 vicryl interrupted suture obtaining watertight closure  a completion ttube cholangiogram wa done at this time which showed slight narrowing and possibly a filling defect proximally below the confluence of the right and left hepatic duct although externally i wa unable to see anything or palpate anything in this area  because of this the ttube wa removed and i passed the choledochoscope proximally again and i wa unable to see any evidence of any lesion or any stone in this area  i felt at this time this wa most likely an impression from the outside which wa still left over a gallbladder where the stone wa stuck and it wa impressing on the bile duct  the bile duct lumen wa widely open  ttube wa again replaced into the bile duct and closed again and a completion ttube cholangiogram appeared to be more satisfactory at this time  the cystic duct opening through which i had done earlier a cystic duct cholangiogram this wa closed with a figureofeight suture of 20 vicryl and this wa actually done earlier and completion cholangiogram did not show any leak from this areathe remaining gallbladder bed which wa left in situ wa cauterized both for hemostasis and to burn off the mucosal lining  subhepatic and subdiaphragmatic space were irrigated with sterile saline solution  hemostasis wa good  a 10mm jacksonpratt drain wa left in the foramen of winslow and brought out through the lateral 5mm port site  the ttube wa brought out through the middle 5mm port site which wa just above the incision  abdominal incision wa then closed in layer using 0 vicryl running suture for the peritoneal layer and 1 novafil running suture for the fascia  subcutaneous tissue wa closed with 30 vicryl running suture in two layer  subfascial and subcutaneous tissue were injected with a total of 20 ml of 025 marcaine with epinephrine for postoperative pain control  the umbilical incision wa closed with 0 vicryl figureofeight suture for the fascia 20 vicryl for the subcutaneous tissue and staple for the skin  sterile dressing wa applied and the patient transferred to recovery room in stable condition ,2.0

relayed that they first noted a relatively small but noticeable mass in the middle portion of her thyroid gland about 2004  an ultrasound examination had reportedly been done in the past and the mass is being observed  when it began to enlarge recently she wa referred to the pediatric endocrinology department and had an evaluation there  the patient wa referred for fine needle aspiration and the report recently returned a diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma  the patient ha not had any hoarseness difficulty swallowing or any symptom of endocrine dysfunction  she ha no weight change

to be grossly normalneck  there is a slightly visible midline bulge in the region of the thyroid isthmus  a firm nodule is present there and there is also some nodularity in the right lobe of the thyroid  this mass is relatively hard slightly fixed but not tethered to surrounding tissue skin or muscle that i can determine  there are some shotty adenopathy in the area  no supraclavicular node

laboratory data from the diagnostics lab which included a mild abnormality in the ast at 11 which is slightly lower than the normal range  t4 and tsh level were recorded a normal  free thyroxine wa normal and the serum pregnancy test wa negative  there wa no level of thyroglobulin recorded on this  a urinalysis and comprehensive metabolic panel wa unremarkable  a chest xray wa obtained which i personally reviewed  there is a diffuse pattern of tiny nodule in both lung typical of miliary metastatic disease that is often seen in patient with metastatic thyroid carcinomaimpressionplan  the patient is a 16yearold young lady with a history of thyroid mass that is now biopsy proven a papillary  the pattern of miliary metastatic lesion in the chest is consistent with this diagnosis and is unfortunate in that it generally mean a more advanced stage of disease  i spent approximately 30 minute with the patient and her family today discussing the surgical aspect of the treatment of this disease  during this time we talked about performing a total thyroidectomy to eradicate a much of the native thyroid tissue and remove the primary source of the cancer in anticipation of radioactive iodine therapy  we talked about sentinel node dissection and we spent significant amount of time talking about the possibility of hypoparathyroidism if all four of the parathyroid gland were damaged during this operation  we also discussed the recurrent laryngeal and external laryngeal branch of the nerve supplying the vocal cord function and how they cane be damaged during the thyroidectomy a well  i answered a many of the family question a they could mount during this stressful time with this recent information supplied to them  i also did talk to them about the chest xray pattern which wa complete  a the film wa just on the day prior to my clinic visit  this will have some impact on the postoperative adjunctive therapy  the radiologist commented about the risk of pulmonary fibrosis and the use of radioactive iodine in this situation but it seems likely that is going to be necessary to attempt to treat this disease in the patient case  i did discus with them the possibility of having to take large dos of calcium and vitamin d in the event of hypoparathyroidism if that doe happen and we also talked about possibly sparing parathyroid tissue and reimplanting it in a muscle belly either in the neck or forearm if that becomes a necessity  all of the family question have been answered  this is a very anxious and anxiety provoking time in the family  i have made every effort to get the patient under schedule within the next 48 hour to have this operation done  we are tentatively planning on proceeding this upcoming friday afternoon with total thyroidectomy ,2.0

level of fascia  the fascia wa very thin ruddy in appearance and with abundant scar tissue  the fascia wa incised  following this we were able to see the peritoneum  there wa really no obvious rectus abdominal muscle noted  they were very weak atrophic and thin  the patient ha the peritoneum tented up  we entered the abdominal cavity  the bladder flap wa then entered into the anterior abdominal wall and to the underlying area of the fascia  the bladder flap wa then entered into the uterus a well  there are some bladder adhesion  we removed these adhesion and we removed the bladder of the

catheter to take multiple cineangiograms of the right and left coronary artery  after using the jr4 6french catheter nitroglycerin wa administered because of the possibility of ostial spasm and following that we used a 5french jr4 catheter for additional cineangiograms of the right coronary artery  a pigtail catheter wa placed in the mid abdominal aorta and abdominal aortic injection wa performed to rule out abdominal aortic aneurysm a there wa dense calcification in the mid abdominal aortaanalysis of pressure data  left ventricular enddiastolic pressure wa 5 mmhg  on continuous

selective cineangiograms were obtained with injection of contrast to the left ventricle coronary artery and mid abdominal aorta  a pigtail catheter wa introduced into the left ventricle and ventriculogram performed in right anterior oblique position  the mitral valve is competent and demonstrates normal mobility  the left ventricular cavity is normal in size with excellent contractility  aneurysmal dilatation andor dyskinesia absent  the aortic valve is tricuspid and normal mobility  the ascending aorta appeared normalpigtail catheter wa introduced in the mid abdominal aorta and placed just above the renal artery  an abdominal aortic injection wa performed  under fluoroscopy we see heavy dense calcification of the mid abdominal aorta between the renal artery and the bifurcation  there wa some difficulty initially with maneuvering the wire pas that area and it wa felt that might be a tight stenosis  the abdominal aortogram reveals wide patency of that area with mild intimal irregularity  there is a normal left renal artery normal right renal artery  the celiac seems to be normal but what i believe is the splenic artery seen initially at it origin is normal  the common left iliac and common right iliac artery are essentially normal in this areacoronary anatomy  one note ostial coronary calcification of the right coronary artery  cineangiogram obtained with 6french jr4 and 5french jr4 catheter  prior to the introduction of the 5french jr4 nitroglycerin wa administered sublingually  the 6french jr4 catheter appeared to a show an ostial lesion of over 50  there wa backwash of dye into the aorta although there is a fine funneling of the ostium towards the proximal right coronary artery  in the proximal portion of the right coronary artery just into the shepherd turn there is a 50 smooth tapering of the right coronary artery in the proximal third  then the artery seems to have a little bit more normal size and it divide into a large posterior descending artery posterolateral branch vessel  the distal portion of the vessel is free of disease  the conus branch is seen arising right at the beginning part of the right coronary artery  we then removed the 6french catheter and following nitroglycerin and sublingually we placed a 5french catheter and again finding a stenosis may be le than 50  at the ostium of the right coronary artery calcification again is identified  backwash of dye noted at the proximal lesion looked about the same 50 along the proximal turn of the shepherd turn areathe left coronary artery is normal although there is a rim of ostial calcification but there is no tapering or stenosis  it form the left anterior descending artery the ramus branch and the circumflex arterythe left anterior descending artery is a very large vessel very tortuous in it proximal segment very tortuous in it mid and distal segment  there appears to be some mild stenosis of 10 in the proximal segment  it give off a large diagonal branch in the proximal portion of the left anterior descending artery and it is free of disease  the remaining portion of the left anterior descending artery is free of disease  upon injection of the left coronary artery we see what i believe is the dye enters probably directly into the left ventricle but via fistula excluding the coronary sinus and we get a ventriculogram performed  i could not identify an isolated area but it seems to be from the interventricular septal collateral that this is taking placethe ramus branch is normal and free of diseasethe left

sugar monitoring in control  the patient wa subsequently taken to the operating room on april 4 2007 wa given general anesthesia and wa endotracheally intubated without incident  although he had markedly difficult airway the patient had fiberoptic bronchoscopy performed all the way down to the level of the subsegmental bronchus  no abnormality were noted in the entire tracheobronchial tree and based on this the decision wa made to proceed with the surgery  the patient wa kept in the supine position and the singlelumen endotracheal tube wa removed and a doublelumen tube wa placed  following this the patient wa placed into the left lateral decubitus position with the right side up and all pressure point were padded  sterile duraprep preparation on the right chest wa placed  a sterile drape around that wa also placed  the table wa flexed to open up the intercostal space  a second bronchoscopy wa performed to confirm placement of the doublelumen endotracheal tube  marcaine

to the inferior tip of the scapula  the camera port wa in the posterior axillary line in the eighth intercostal space through which a 5mm 30degree scope wa used  third incision wa an anterior port which wa approximately 2 cm inferior to the inframammary crease and the midclavicular line in the anterior sixth intercostal space and the third incision wa a utility port which wa a 4 cm long incision which wa approximately one rib space below the superior pulmonary vein  all of these incision were eventually created during the procedure  the initial incision wa the camera port through which under direct visualization an additional small 5mm port wa created just inferior to the anterior port  these two port were used to identify the chest wall lesion which were initially thought to be metastatic lesion  multiple biopsy of the chest wall lesion were taken and the decision wa made to also insert the auscultatory incision port  through these three incision the initial working of the diagnostic portion of the chest wall lesion wa performed  multiple biopsy were taken of the entire chest wall offer and specimen came back a negative  the right middle lobe wa noted to be adherent to the anterior chest wall  this area wa taken down and the entire pleural surface along this area wa taken down and sent for frozen pathologic analysis  this also returned a negative with only fibrotic tissue and a few lymphocyte within the fibrotic tissue but no tumor cell  based on this the decision wa made to not proceed with chest wall resection and continue with right middle lobectomy

superior pulmonary vein wa initially dissected and stapled with vascular load 45mm endogia stapler  following division of the right superior pulmonary vein the right middle lobe bronchus wa easily identified  initially this wa thought to be the main right middle lobe bronchus but in fact it wa the medial branch of the right middle lobe bronchus  this wa encircled and divided with a blue load stapler with a 45mm endogia  following division of this the pulmonary artery wa easily identified  two branch of the pulmonary artery were noted to be going into the right middle lobe  these were individually divided with a vascular load after encircling with a right angle clamp  the vascular staple load completely divided these arterial branch successfully from the main pulmonary artery trunk and following this an additional branch of the bronchus wa noted to be going to the right middle lobe  a fiberoptic bronchoscopy wa performed intraoperatively and confirmed that this wa in fact the lateral branch of the right middle lobe bronchus  this wa divided with a blue load stapler 45 mm endogia  following division of this the minor and major fissure were completed along the edge of the right middle lobe separating the right upper lobe from the right middle lobe a well a the right middle lobe from the right lower lobe  following complete division of the fissure the lobe wa put into

encountered wa a large amount of fibrous scar tissue  dissection wa carried sharply down through this scar tissue  soft tissue plain were extremely difficult to visualize due to all the scarring  there wa no native tissue to orient oneself with  we carried our dissection down through the scar tissue to what seemed to be a fascial layer  we incised through the fascial layer down to some scarred gluteus maximus muscle and down over what wa initially felt to be the greater trochanter  dissection wa carried down through soft tissue and the distal located antibiotic spacer wa exposed  this wa used a a landmark to orient remainder of the dissection  the antibiotic spacer wa exposed and followed distally to expose the proximal femur  dissection wa continued posteriorly and proximally to expose the acetabulum  a cobra retractor wa able to be inserted across the superior aspect of the acetabulum to enhance exposure  once improved visualization wa obtained the antibiotic spacer wa removed from the femur  this allowed further improved visualization of the acetabulum  the acetabulum wa filled with soft tissue debris and scar tissue  this wa removed with sharp excision with a

the patient wa taken to the operative suite at abcd general hospital on 090803 placed on the operative table in supine position  department of anesthesia administered general anesthetic  once adequately anesthetized the right lower extremity wa placed in a johnson knee holder  care wa ensured that all bony prominence were well padded and she wa positioned and secured  after adequately positioned the right lower extremity wa prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion  attention wa then directed to creation of the arthroscopic portal both medial and lateral portal were made for arthroscope and instrumentation respectively  the arthroscope wa advanced through the inferolateral portal taking in a suprapatellar pouch  all compartment were then examined in sequential order with photodocumentation of each compartment  the patella wa noted to have gradeii change of the inferior surface otherwise appeared to track within the trochlear groove  there wa mild grooving of the trochlear cartilage  the medial gutter wa visualized  there wa no evidence of loose body  the medial compartment wa then entered  there wa noted to be a large defect on the medial femoral condyle grade iiiiv chondromalacia change with exposed bone in evidence of osteochondral displaced fragment  there wa also noted to be a degenerative meniscal tear of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus  the arthroscopic probe wa then introduced and the meniscus and chondral surface were probed throughout it entirety and photo were taken  at this point a meniscal shaver wa then introduced and the chondral surface were debrided a well a any loose body removed  this gave a smooth shoulder to the chondral lesion  after this the meniscus wa debrided until it had been smooth over the frayed edge  at this point the shaver wa removed  the meniscal binder wa then introduced and the meniscus wa further debrided until the tear wa adequately contained at this point  the shaver wa reintroduced and all particle were again removed and the meniscus wa smoothed over the edge  the probe wa then reintroduced and the shaver removed the meniscus wa probed  and now found to be stable  at this point attention wa directed to the rest of the knee  the acl wa examined  it wa intact and stable  the lateral compartment wa then entered  there wa noted to be a grade iiiii change of the lateral femoral condyle  again with the edge of some friability at the shoulder of this cartilage lesion  there wa noted to be some mild degenerative fraying of the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus  the probe wa introduced and the remaining meniscus appeared stable  this wa then removed and the stapler wa introduced  a chondroplasty and meniscoplasty were then performed until adequately debrided and smoothed over  the lateral gutter wa then visualized  there wa no evidence of loose body  attention wa then redirected back to the medial and femoral condylesat this point a 062 kwire wa then placed in through the initial portal medial portal a well a an additional poke hole so we can gain access and proper orientation to the medial femoral lesion  microfacial technique wa then used to introduce the kwire into the subchondral bone in multiple area until we had evidence of some bleeding to allow  of this lesion  after this wa performed the shaver wa then reintroduced and the loose body and loose fragment were further debrided  at this point the shaver wa then moved to the suprapatellar pouch and the patellar chondroplasty wa then performed until adequately debrided  again all compartment were then revisualized and there wa no further evidence of other pathology or loose body  the knee wa then copiously irrigated and suctioned dry  all instrumentation wa removed  approximately 20 cc of 025 plain marcaine wa injected into the portal site and the remaining portion intraarticular  sterile dressing of adaptic 4x4s abds and webril were then applied  the patient wa then transferred back to the gurney in supine positiondisposition  the patient tolerated the procedure well with no complication  the patient wa transferred to pacu in satisfactory condition ,2.0

noticed mild abdominal cramping in february 2007  at that time she wa pregnant and wa unsure if her symptom might have been due to the pregnancy  unfortunately she had miscarriage at about seven week  she again had abdominal cramping severe in late march 2007  she underwent colonoscopy on 04302007 by dr y  of note she is with a family history of early colon cancer and had her first colonoscopy at age 35 and no polyp were seen at that timeon colonoscopy she wa found to have a nearobstructing lesion at the splenic flexure  she wa not able to have the scope passed past this lesion  pathology showed a colon cancer although i do not have a copy of that report at this timeshe had surgical resection done yesterday  the surgery wa laparoscopic assisted with anastomosis  at the time of surgery lymph node were palpablepathology showed colon adenocarcinoma low grade measuring 38 x 17 cm circumferential and invading in to the subserosal mucosa greater than 5 mm 13 lymph node were negative for metastasis  there wa no angiolymphatic invasion noted  radial margin wa 01 mm  other margin were 5 and 6 mm  testing for microsatellite instability is still pendingstaging ha already been done with a ct scan of the chest abdomen and pelvis  this showed a mass at the splenic flexure mildly enlarged lymph node there and no evidence of metastasis to liver lung or other organ  the degenerative change were noted at l5s1  the ovary were normal  an intrauterine device iud wa present in the uterusreview of system  she ha otherwise been feeling well  she ha not had fever night sweat or noticed lymphadenopathy  she ha not had cough shortness of breath back pain bone pain blood in her stool melena or change in stool caliber  she wa eating well up until the time of her surgery  she is uptodate

ha no child  an iud wa recently placed  she work a an estheticianfamily history  father died of stage iv colon cancer at age 45  this occurred when the patient wa young and she is not sure of the rest of the paternal family history  she doe believe that aunt and uncle on that side may have died early  her brother died of pancreas cancer at age 44  another brother is aged 52 and he had polyp on colonoscopy a couple of year ago  otherwise he ha no medical problem  mother is aged 82 and healthy  she wa recently diagnosed with hemochromatosisphysical examination  general  she is in no acute

with a stage t3c n0 m0 colon cancer grade 1  she doe not have highrisk factor such a high grade or angiolymphatic invasion and adequate number of lymph node were sampled  although the tumor wa near obstructing she wa not having symptom and in fact wa having normal bowel movementsa lengthy discussion wa held with the patient regarding her diagnosis and prognosis  firstly she ha a good prognosis for being cured without adjuvant therapy  i would consider her borderline for chemotherapy given her young age  referring to the database that had been online she ha a 13 chance of relapse in the next five year and with aggressive chemotherapy xlinked agammaglobulinemia xla platinumbased this would be reduced to an 8 risk of relapse with a 5 benefit  chemotherapy with 5fu based regimen would have a smaller benefit of around 25plan wa made to allow her to recuperate and then meet with her and her husband to discus the pro and con of adjuvant chemotherapy including what regimen she could consider including the side effect  we did not review all that information todayshe ha a family history of early colon cancer  her mother will be visiting in the weekend and plan is to obtain the rest of the paternal family history if we can  tumor is being tested for microsatellite instability and we will discus this when those result are available  she ha one sibling and he is uptodate on colonoscopy  she doe report multiple tube of blood were drawn prior to her admission  i will check with dr y office whether she ha had a cea and liverassociated enzyme assessed  if not those can be drawn tomorrow

a parallel fashion down to the level of bleeding bone using a highspeed cutting bur with irrigant solution for cooling  the disc space were then measured to the nearest millimeter  attention wa then turned toward preparation of the structural allograft which consisted of two piece of premachined corticocancellous bone  the graft were further shaped to fit the disc space exactly in a pressfit manner with approximately 15 mm of distraction at each disc space  the graft were shaped to be slightly lordotic to help preserve the cervical lordosis  the graft were impacted into the disc space  there wa complete bony apposition between the end of the bone graft and the vertebral body of c5 c6 and c7  a blunt nerve hook wa passed posterior to each bone graft to make sure that the bone graft were in good position  anterior osteophyte were removed using a highspeed cutting bur with irrigant solution for cooling  an appropriate length synthes cervical plate wa selected and bent slightly to

2514,reason for consultation  thyroid mass diagnosed a papillary carcinomahistory of present illness  the patient is a 16yearold young lady who wa referred from the pediatric endocrinology department by dr x for evaluation and surgical recommendation regarding treatment of a mass in her thyroid which ha now been proven to be papillary carcinoma on fine needle aspiration biopsy  the patient parent relayed that they first noted a relatively small but noticeable mass in the middle portion of her thyroid gland about 2004  an ultrasound examination had reportedly been done in the past and the mass is being observed  when it began to enlarge recently she wa referred to the pediatric endocrinology department and had an evaluation there  the patient wa referred for fine needle aspiration and the report recently returned a diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma  the patient ha not had any hoarseness difficulty swallowing or any symptom of endocrine dysfunction  she ha no weight change consistent with either hyper or hypothyroidism  there is no family history of thyroid cancer in her family  she ha no notable discomfort with this lesion  there have been no skin change  historically she doe not have a history of any prior head and neck radiation or treatment of any unusual endocrinopathypast medical history  essentially unremarkable  the patient ha never been hospitalized in the past for any major illness  she ha had no prior surgical proceduresimmunizations  current and up to dateallergies  she ha no known drug allergiescurrent medication  currently taking no routine medication  she describes her pain level currently a zerofamily history  there is no significant family history although the patient father doe note that his mother had a thyroid surgery at some point in life but it wa not known whether this wa for cancer but he suspect it might have been for goiter  this wa done in tijuana  his mom is from central portion of mexico  there is no family history of multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromessocial history  the patient is a junior at hoover high school  she life with her mom in fresnoreview of system  a careful 12system review wa completely normal except for the problem related to the thyroid massphysical examinationgeneral  the patient is a 557 kg nondysmorphic quiet and perhaps slightly apprehensive young lady who wa in no acute distress  she wa alert and oriented x3 and had an appropriate affectheent  the head and neck examination is most significant  there is mild amount of facial acne  the patient head eye ear nose and throat appeared to be grossly normalneck  there is a slightly visible midline bulge in the region of the thyroid isthmus  a firm nodule is present there and there is also some nodularity in the right lobe of the thyroid  this mass is relatively hard slightly fixed but not tethered to surrounding tissue skin or muscle that i can determine  there are some shotty adenopathy in the area  no supraclavicular node were notedchest  excursion are symmetric with good air entrylungs  clearcardiovascular  normal  there is no tachycardia or murmur notedabdomen  benignextremities  extremity are anatomically correct with full range of motiongenitourinary  external genitourinary exam wa deferred at this time and can be performed later during anesthesia  this is same a too for her rectal examinationskin  there is no acute rash purpura or petechiaeneurologic  normal and no focal deficit  her voice is strong and clear  there is no evidence of dysphonia or vocal cord malfunctiondiagnostic study  i reviewed laboratory data from the diagnostics lab which included a mild abnormality in the ast at 11 which is slightly lower than the normal range  t4 and tsh level were recorded a normal  free thyroxine wa normal and the serum pregnancy test wa negative  there wa no level of thyroglobulin recorded on this  a urinalysis and comprehensive metabolic panel wa unremarkable  a chest xray wa obtained which i personally reviewed  there is a diffuse pattern of tiny nodule in both lung typical of miliary metastatic disease that is often seen in patient with metastatic thyroid carcinomaimpressionplan  the patient is a 16yearold young lady with a history of thyroid mass that is now biopsy proven a papillary  the pattern of miliary metastatic lesion in the chest is consistent with this diagnosis and is unfortunate in that it generally mean a more advanced stage of disease  i spent approximately 30 minute with the patient and her family today discussing the surgical aspect of the treatment of this disease  during this time we talked about performing a total thyroidectomy to eradicate a much of the native thyroid tissue and remove the primary source of the cancer in anticipation of radioactive iodine therapy  we talked about sentinel node dissection and we spent significant amount of time talking about the possibility of hypoparathyroidism if all four of the parathyroid gland were damaged during this operation  we also discussed the recurrent laryngeal and external laryngeal branch of the nerve supplying the vocal cord function and how they cane be damaged during the thyroidectomy a well  i answered a many of the family question a they could mount during this stressful time with this recent information supplied to them  i also did talk to them about the chest xray pattern which wa complete  a the film wa just on the day prior to my clinic visit  this will have some impact on the postoperative adjunctive therapy  the radiologist commented about the risk of pulmonary fibrosis and the use of radioactive iodine in this situation but it seems likely that is going to be necessary to attempt to treat this disease in the patient case  i did discus with them the possibility of having to take large dos of calcium and vitamin d in the event of hypoparathyroidism if that doe happen and we also talked about possibly sparing parathyroid tissue and reimplanting it in a muscle belly either in the neck or forearm if that becomes a necessity  all of the family question have been answered  this is a very anxious and anxiety provoking time in the family  i have made every effort to get the patient under schedule within the next 48 hour to have this operation done  we are tentatively planning on proceeding this upcoming friday afternoon with total thyroidectomy ,2.0

of persistent pain to the left shoulder and left elbow  she wa seen in clinic on 121107 during which time mri of the left shoulder showed no evidence of rotator cuff tear  she did have a previous mri of the cervical spine that did show an osteophyte on the left c6c7 level  based on this negative mri of the shoulder the patient wa recommended to have anterior cervical discectomy with anterior interbody fusion at c6c7 level  operation expected outcome risk and benefit were discussed with her  risk include but not exclusive of bleeding and infection bleeding could be soft tissue bleeding which may compromise airway and may result in return to the operating room emergently for evacuation of said hematoma  there is also the possibility of bleeding into the epidural space which can compress the spinal cord and result in weakness and numbness of all four extremity a well a impairment of bowel and bladder function  should this occur the patient understands that she need to be brought emergently back to the operating room for evacuation of said hematoma  there is also the risk of infection which can be superficial and can be managed with po antibiotic  however the patient may develop deeperseated infection which may require return to the operating room  should the infection be in the area of the spinal instrumentation this will cause a dilemma since there might be a need to remove the spinal instrumentation andor allograft  there is also the possibility of potential injury to the esophageus the trachea and the carotid artery  there is also the risk of stroke on

cardiopulmonary bypass time total  procedure in detail  after obtaining informed consent from the patient including a thorough explanation of the risk and benefit of the aforementioned procedure patient wa taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia wa administered  next the neck chest and leg were prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion  we used a 10blade scalpel to make a midline median sternotomy incision  dissection wa carried down to the left of the sternum using bovie electrocautery  the sternum wa opened with a sternal saw  the chest retractor wa positioned  next fulldose heparin wa given  the pericardium wa opened  pericardial stay suture were positioned  after obtaining adequate act we prepared to place the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass  a 20 double pursestring of ethibond suture wa placed in the ascending aorta  through this wa passed an aortic cannula connected to the arterial side of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine  next a 30 prolene pursestring wa placed in the right atrial appendage  through this wa passed our venous cannula connected to the venous portion of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine  a 40 ustitch wa placed in the right atrium  a retrograde cardioplegia catheter wa positioned at this site  next scissors were used to dissect out the right upper pulmonary vein  a 40 prolene pursestring wa placed in the right upper pulmonary vein  next a rightangle sump wa placed at this position  we then connected our retrograde cardioplegia catheter to the cardioplegia solution circuit  bovie electrocautery wa used to dissect the interface between the aorta and pulmonary artery  the aorta wa completely encircled  next an antegrade cardioplegia needle and associated sump were placed in the ascending aorta  we then prepared to crossclamp the aorta  we went down on our flow and crossclamped the aorta  we backed up our flow  we then gave antegrade and retrograde cold blood cardioplegia solution circuit so a to arrest the heart  the patient had some aortic insufficiency so we elected after initially arresting the heart to open the aorta and transect it and then give direct ostial infusion of cardioplegia solution circuit  next after obtaining complete diastolic arrest of the heart we turned our attention to exposing the aortic valve and 40 tycron suture were placed in the commissure  in addition a 20 prolene suture wa placed in the aortic wall so a to bring the aortic wall and root up into view  next scissors were used to excise the diseased aortic valve leaflet  care wa taken to remove all the calcium from the aortic annulus  we then sized up the aortic annulus which came out to be a mm stentless porcine toronto valve  we prepared the valve  next we placed our proximal suture line of interrupted 40 tycron suture for the annulus  we started with our individual commissural stitch  they were connected to our valve sewing ring  next we placed 5 interrupted 40 tycron suture in a subannular fashion at each commissural position  after doing so we passed 1 end of the suture through the sewing portion of the toronto stentless porcine valve  the valve wa lowered into place and all of the suture were tied  next we gave another round of cold blood antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia  next we sewed our distal suture line  we began with the left coronary cusp of the valve  we ran a 50 rb needle up both side of the valve  care wa taken to avoid the left coronary ostia  this procedure wa repeated on the right cusp of the stentless porcine valve  again care wa taken to avoid any injury to the coronary ostia  lastly we sewed our noncoronary cusp  this wa done without difficulty  at this point we inspected our aortic valve  there wa good coaptation of the leaflet and it wa noted that both the left and the right coronary ostia were open  we gave another round of cold blood antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia  the antegrade portion wa given in a direct ostial fashion once again  we now turned our attention to closing the aorta  a 40 prolene double row of suture wa used to close the aorta in a running fashion  just prior to closing we deaired the heart and gave a warm shot of antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia  at this point we removed our aortic crossclamp  the heart gradually regained it electromechanical activity  we placed 2 atrial and 2 ventricular pacing wire  we removed our aortic vent and oversewed that site with another 40 prolene on an sh needle  we removed our retrograde cardioplegia catheter  we oversewed that site with a 50 prolene  by now the heart wa deaired and resumed normal electromechanical activity  we began to wean the patient from cardiopulmonary bypass  we then removed our venous cannula and suture ligated that site with a 2 silk  we then gave fulldose protamine  after knowing that there wa no evidence of a protamine reaction we removed the aortic cannula  we buttressed that site with a 40 prolene on an sh needle  we placed a mediastinal chest tube and brought it out through the skin  we also placed 2 blake drain 1 in the left chest and 1 in the right chest a the patient had some bilateral pleural effusion  they were brought out through the skin  the sternum wa closed with 7 wire in an interrupted figureofeight fashion  the fascia wa closed with 1 vicryl  we closed the subcu tissue with 20 vicryl and the skin

which extended from medial to lateral with the dorsal portion of the blade angled proximally about five degree through the dorsal third of the distal first metatarsal  following this attention wa directed proximally and an incision osteotomy cut through the bone wa made directed medially to laterally with the inferior portion of the blade angled distally to transect the cortex of the bone  following this the distal portion of the osteotomy cut wa freely movable and wa able to be translocated medially  the head wa then slit medially several millimeter until it wa noted to be in good position and no chopping wa present in the medullary canal of the bone  following this the bone wa stabilized using a 045 kwire distally a well a proximally directed from dorsal to planar direction  next using the normal ao manner the distal cortex wa drilled from dorsal to plantar with a 20 mm drill bit and then over drilled proximally with the cortex using a 27 mm drill bit  the proximal cortex wa then  and then the drill hole wa measured and it wa determined to be 18 mm in length from dorsal to plantar cortex  then using 27 mm tap the thread hole were placed and using an 18 x 27 mm screw  wa achieved and good apposition of the bone and tightness were achieved  intramedullary sludge wa noted to exit from the osteotomy cut  following this attention wa directed proximally and the 045 kwire wa removed and the hole were predrilled using a 20 mm screw then overdrilled using 27 mm screw and counter sucked  following this the hole were measured found to 20 mm in length and the drill hole wa tapped using a 27 mm tap  following this a 20 mm full threaded screw wa inserted and tightened  good intramedullary sludge wa noted and compression wa achieved  attention wa then directed to the distal screw where it wa once again tightened and found to be in good position with good bite  following this range of motion wa performed on the first metatarsophalangeal joint and some lateral deviation of the hallux wa noted  based on this a lateral release wa performed  the extensor hallucis longus tendon wa identified and wa transected medially and a linear incision wa placed down using a 15 blade into the first interspace  the incision wa then deepened with sharp and blunt dissection and using a curved hemostat the transverse a well a the oblique fiber of the abductor hallucis tendon were identified and transected  care wa taken to perform lateral release around the fibular sesamoid through these suspensory ligament a well a the transverse metatarsal ligament and the collateral ligament  upon completion of this the hallux wa noted to be in a rectus position with good alignment  the area wa then flushed and irrigated with copious amount of sterile saline  after this attention wa directed back to the medial capsule and a medial capsulorrhaphy wa performed and the capsule wa closed using 30 vicryl suture  subcutaneous tissue were closed using 30 and 40 vicryl suture to close in layer  the skin wa then reapproximated and closed using 50 monocryl suture  following this the incision were dressed and bandaged in the normal manner using owen silk 4x4s kling and kerlix a well a coban dressing  the tourniquet wa then dropped with a total tourniquet time of 99 minute at 250 mmhg  the patient followed the procedure and the anesthesia well and vascular status wa intact a noted by immediate hyperemia to digit one through five of the left foot  the patient wa then transferred back to the cart and escorted on the cart to the postanesthesia care unit  following this the patient wa given prescription for vicoprofen total 20 to be taken one every six hour a necessary for moderate to severe pain  the patient wa also given prescription for clindamycin to be taken 300 mg four time a day  the patient wa given surgical shoe and wa placed in a posterior sling  the patient wa given crutch and instructed to use them for ambulation  the patient wa instructed to

down across the top of her left shoulder and also across her shoulder blade to the right side but predominantly down the left upper extremity into the wrist  the patient ha been diagnosed with fibromyalgia and subsequently ha been treated with pain medication antiinflammatories and muscle relaxant  the patient symptom continued to persist and subsequently an mri of the cspine wa done which showed disc desiccation spondylosis and herniated disk at c5c6 an emg and cv revealed a presence of mildtomoderate carpal tunnel syndrome  the patient is now being recommended to undergo decompression and spinal instrumentation and fusion at c5c6  the patient understood the risk and benefit of the surgery  risk include but not exclusive of bleeding and infection  bleeding can be in the form of soft tissue bleeding which may compromise airway for which she can be brought emergently back to the operating room for emergent evacuation of the hematoma a this may cause weakness of all four extremity numbness of all four extremity a well a impairment of bowel and bladder function  this could also result in dural tear with it attendant symptom of headache nausea vomiting photophobia and posterior neck pain a well a the development of pseudomeningocele  should the symptom be severe or the pseudomeningocele be large she can be brought back to the operating room for repair of the csf leak and evacuation of the pseudomeningocele  there is also the risk of pseudoarthrosis and nonfusion for which she may require redo surgery at this level  there is also the possibility of nonimprovement of her symptom in about 10 of case  the patient understands this risk on top of the potential injury to the esophagus and trachea a well a the carotid artery  there is also the risk of stroke should an

proctocolitisacute hiv seroconversion  this subject is sexually active and report inconsistent condom use  gastrointestinal symptom have recently been reported commonly in patient with a history of hiv seroconversion  the rectal symptom of bleeding and pain are not common with hiv and an alternative diagnosis would be requiredperirectal abscess  a patient with a history of receptive anal intercourse is at risk for developing a perirectal abscess either from trauma or a concurrent std  the patient could experience more systemic symptom with fever and malaise a found with this patient  however the physical examination did not reveal the typical localized area of pain and edemadiagnosis  the subject had rectal culture obtained which were positive for neisseria gonorrhoeae  an hiv elisa wa positive a wa the rna pcrdiscussion  this patient demonstrates a number of key issue to consider when caring for an adolescent or young adult  first the patient utilized the emergency department for care a opposed to identifying a primary care provider  although not ideal in many circumstance testing for hiv infection is crucial when there is suspicion since many newly diagnosed patient identify earlier contact with health care provider when hiv counseling and testing were not performed  second this young man ha had both male and female sexual partner  a young people explore their sexuality asking about partner in an open nonjudgmental manner without applying label is integral to helping the young person discus their sexual behavior  assuming heterosexuality is a major barrier to disclosure for many young people who have samesex attraction  third screening for std must take into account sexual behavior  although urinebased screening ha expanded testing of young people it miss anal and pharyngeal infection  if a young person is only having receptive oral or anal intercourse urine screening is insufficient to rule out std  fourth this young man had both localized and systemic symptom  a his anal symptom were most suggestive of a current std performing an hiv test should be part of the standard evaluation  in addition a acute infection is on the differential diagnosis pcr testing should also be considered  the care provided to this young man included the following  he wa treated presumptively for proctitis with both im ceftriaxone a well a oral doxycycline to treat n gonorrhoeae and c trachomatis  ceftriaxone wa chosen due to the recent report of resistant n gonorrhoeae  at the time of the diagnosis the young man wa given the opportunity to meet with the case manager from the adolescentspecific hiv program  the case manager linked this young man directly to care after providing brief counseling and support  the case

wa not really under the best circumstance and i had to curtail the amount of time i spent trying to get a history because of the physical effort required in extracting information from this patient  the patient wa seen late because he had not filled in the patient questionnaire  to summarize the history here mr xyz who is not very clear on event from the past sustained a workrelated injury some time in 1998  at that time he wa driving an 18wheeler truck  the patient indicated that he slipped off the rear of his truck while loading vehicle to his trailer  he experienced severe low back pain and eventually a short while later underwent a fusion of l4l5 and l5s1  the patient had an uneventful hospital course from the surgery which wa done somewhere in florida by a surgeon who he doe not remember  he wa able to return to his usual occupation but then again had a second workrelated injury in may of 2005  at that time he wa required to boat truck to his rig and also to use a chainpulley system to raise and lower the vehicle  mr xyz felt a popping sound in his back and had excruciating low back pain and had to be transported to the nearest hospital  he wa mried at that time which apparently showed a reherniation of an l5s1 disc and then he somehow ended up in houston where he underwent fusion by dr w from l3 through s2  this wa done on 12152005  initially he did fairly well and wa able to walk and move around but then gradually the pain reappeared and he started getting severe leftsided leg pain going down the lateral aspect of the left leg into his foot  he is still complaining of the severe pain right now with tingling in the medial two toe of the foot and significant weakness in his left leg  the patient wa referred to dr a pain management specialist and dr a ha maintained him on opioid medication consisting of norco 10325 mg for breakthrough pain and oxycodone 30 mg tid with lunesta 3 mg qhs for sleep carisoprodol 350 mg tid and lyrica 100 mg qdaily  the patient state that he is experiencing no side effect from medication and take medication a required  he ha apparently been drug screened and his drug screening ha been found to be normal  the patient underwent an extensive behavioral evaluation on 052206 by tir rehab center  at that time it wa felt that mr xyz showed a degree of moderate level of depression  there were no indication in the evaluation that mr xyz showed any addictive or noncompliant type behavior  it wa felt at that time that mr xyz would benefit from a brief period of individual psychotherapy and a course of psychotropic medication  of concern to the therapist at that time wa the patient untreated and unmonitored hypertension and diabetes  mr xyz indicated at that time they had not purchased any prescription medication or any of these healthrelated issue because of financial limitation  he still apparently is not under really good treatment for either of these condition and on today evaluation he actually denies that he had diabetes  the impression wa that the patient had axis iv diagnosis of chronic functional limitation financial loss and low loss with no axis iii diagnosis  this wa done by rhonda ackerman phd a psychologist  it wa also suggested at that time that the patient should quit smoking  despite these evaluation mr xyz really did not get involved in psychotherapy and there wa poor attendance of these visit there wa no clearance given for any surgical intervention and it wa felt that the patient ha benefited from the use of ssri  of concern in june of 2006 wa that the patient had still not stopped smoking despite warning  his hypertension and diabetes were still not under good control and the patient wa assessed at significant risk for additional health complication including stroke reduced mental clarity and future fall  it wa felt that any surgical intervention should be put on hold at that time  in september of 2006 the patient wa evaluated at baylor college of medicine in the occupational health program  the evaluation wa done by a physician at that time whose report is clearly documented in the record  evaluation wa done by dr b  at present mr xyz continues on with his oxycodone and norco  these were prescribed by dr a two and a half week ago and the patient state that he ha enough medication left to last him for about another two and a half week  the patient state that there ha been no recent change in either the severity or the distribution of his pain  he is unable to sleep because of pain and his activity of daily living are severely limited  he spends most of his day lying on the floor watching tv and occasionally will walk a while   from detailed questioning show that his activity of daily living are practically zero  the patient denies smoking at this time  he denies alcohol use or aberrant drug use  he obtains no pain medication from no other source  review of mri done on 021006 show laminectomy

ha a history of vascular dementia so her history is somewhat unreliable it seems and she is somnolent at that time  she doe have chronic atrial fibrillation again documented at least present since 2007 and i found an ekg report by dr x which show atrial fibrillation on 082907 per her report  one of the question we were asked wa whether the patient would be a candidate for coumadin  clearly given her history of small ministrokes i think coumadin would be appropriate given this chronic atrial fibrillation but the main issue is the fall risk  if not felt to be significant fall risk then i would strongly recommend coumadin a the patient herself state that she ha only fallen twice in the past year  i would defer that decision to dr z and dr xy who know the patient well and it may be that physical therapy consult is appropriate to help adjudicaterecommendations1  fall assessment a per dr z and dr xy with possible pt consult if felt appropriate and if the patient is not felt to be at significant fall risk would put her on coumadin  given her history of small stroke a documented in the chart and her chronic atrial fibrillation she doe have reasonable heart rate control on current labetalol2  the patient ha elevated bnp and i suspect that is due to her severe pulmonary hypertension and renal failure and in the light of normal lv function i would not make any further evaluation of that other than aggressive diuresis3  regarding this minimal troponin elevation i do not feel this is a diagnosis especially in the setting of pulmonary hypertension and her smalltomoderate sized stable pericardial effusion again that ha been longstanding since 2007 from what i can tell and there is no evidence of tamponade  i would defer to her usual cardiologist dr x whether an outpatient stress evaluation is appropriate for risk stratification  i did find that the patient had a prior cardiac stress test in 0807 where they felt that there wa some subtle reversibility of the anterior wall but it wa felt that it may be artifact rather than true ischemia with normal lv function seen on that study a well4  continue norvasc for history of hypertension a well a labetalol5  the patient is felt to be a significant fall risk and will at least continue her aspirin 81 mg once a day for secondary cva thromboprophylaxis albeit understanding that it is inferior to coumadin6  continue

recur and gradually got worse  repeat study including myelogram and postspinal ct revealed some blunting of the nerve root at c4c5 and c5c6  there wa also noted to be some annular bulge at c3c4 and c6c7  the ct scan in march revealed that the fusion wa not fully solid  xrays were done in november including flexion and extension view it appeared that the fusion wa solidthe patient had been on pain medication  the patient had undergone several nonoperative treatment  he wa given the option of surgical intervention  we discussed botox i discussed with the patient and posterior cervical decompression  i explained to the patient this will leave a larger scar on his neck and that no guarantee would help there would be more bleeding and more pain from the posterior surgery than it wa from the anterior surgery  if at the time of surgery there wa some motion of the c4c5 level i would recommend a fusion  the patient wa a smoker and had been advised to quit smoking but ha not quit smoking  i have therefore recommended that he use iliac bone graft  i explained to the patient that this would give him a scar over the back of the right pelvis and could be a source of chronic pain for the patient for the rest of his life  even if this type of bone graft wa used there wa no guarantee that it will fuse and he should stop smoking completelythe patient also wa advised that if i did a fusion i would also use post instrumentation which wa a wire  the wire would be left permanentlyeven with all these procedure there wa no guarantee that his symptom would improve  his numbness tingling and weakness could get worse rather than better his neck pain and arm pain could persist  he still had some residual bursitis in his left shoulder and this would not be cured by this procedure  other procedure may be necessary later  there is still with a danger of becoming quadriplegic or losing total control of bowel or bladder function  he could lose total control of his arm or leg and end up in the bed for the rest of his life  he could develop chronic regional pain syndrome  he could get difficulty swallowing or eating  he could have substantial weakness in the arm  he wa advised that he should not undergo the surgery unless the pain is persistent severe and unremittinghe wa also offered his record if he would like any other pain medication or seek other treatment he wa advised that dr x would continue to prescribe pain medication if he did not wish to proceed with surgeryhe stated he understood all the risk  he did not wish to get any other treatment  he said the pain ha reached the point that he wished to proceed with surgeryprocedure in detail  in the operating room he wa given general endotracheal anesthesiai then carefully rolled the patient on thoracic roll  his head wa controlled by a horseshoe holder  the anesthesiologist checked the eye position to make sure there wa no pressure on the orbit and the anesthesiologist continued to check them every 15 minute  the arm the right hip and the neck wa then prepped and draped  care wa taken to position both arm and both leg  pulse were checkeda midline incision wa made through the skin and subcutaneous tissue on the cervical spine  a loupe magnification and headlamp illumination wa used  bleeding vessel were cauterized  meticulous hemostasis wa carried out throughout the procedure  gradually and carefully i exposed the spinous process of the c6 c5 and c4  a lateral view wa done after an instrument in place  this revealed the c6c7 level  i therefore did a small laminotomy opening at c4c5  i placed an instrument and xrays confirmed c4c5 leveli stripped the muscle from the lamina and then moved them laterally and held with a selfretaining retractoronce i identified the level i then used a bur to thin the lamina of c5  i used a 1mm followed by a 2mm kerrison rongeur to carefully remove the lamina off c5 on the left  i removed some of the superior lamina of c6 and some of the inferior lamina of c4  this allowed me to visualize the dura and the nerve root and gradually do neural foraminotomies for both the c5 and c6 nerve root  there wa some bleeding from the epidural vein and a bipolar cautery wa used  absolutely no retractor were ever placed in the canal  there wa no retraction  i wa able to place a small probe underneath the nerve root and check the disc space to make sure there wa no fragment of disc or herniation disc and none were foundat the end of the procedure the neuroforamen were widely patent  the nerve root had been fully decompressedi then checked stability  there wa micromotion at the c4c5 level  i therefore elected to proceed with a fusioni debrided the interspinous ligament between c4 and c5  i used a bur to roughen up the surface of the superior portion of the spinous process of c5 and the inferior portion of c4  using a small drill i opened the facet at c4c5  i then used a very small curette to clean up the articular cartilage  i used a bur then to roughen up the lamina at c4c5attention wa turned to the right and left hip which wa also prepped  an incision made over the iliac crest  bleeding vessel were cauterized  i exposed just the posterior aspect of the crest  i removed some of the bone and then used the curette to remove cancellous bonei placed the songer wire through the base of the spinous process of c4 and c5  drill hole made with a clip  i then packed cancellous bone between the decorticated spinous process  i then tightened the songer wire to the appropriate tension and then cut off the excess wireprior to tightening the wire i also packed cancellous bone with facet at c4c5  i then laid bone upon the decorticated lamina of c4 and c5the hip wound wa irrigated with bacitracin and kantrex  deep

pathologic analysis  the final frozen pathology on this entire area returned a negative for tumor  additional chest wall abnormality were biopsied and sent for pathologic analysis and these all returned separately a negative for tumor and only fibrotic tissue  several other biopsy were taken and sent for permanent analysis of the chest wall  all of the biopsy site were additionally marked with hemoclips  the right middle lobe lesion wa accompanied with distal pneumonitis and otherwise no direct involvement of the right upper lobe or right lower lobeestimated blood loss  le than 100 mlcondition of the patient after surgery  stablehistory of procedure  this patient is well known to our service  he wa admitted the night before surgery and given hemodialysis and had close blood sugar monitoring in control  the patient wa subsequently taken to the operating room on april 4 2007 wa given general anesthesia and wa endotracheally intubated without incident  although he had markedly difficult airway the patient had fiberoptic bronchoscopy performed all the way down to the level of the subsegmental bronchus  no abnormality were noted in the entire tracheobronchial tree and based on this the decision wa made to proceed with the surgery  the patient wa kept in the supine position and the singlelumen endotracheal tube wa removed and a doublelumen tube wa placed  following this the patient wa placed into the left lateral decubitus position with the right side up and all pressure point were padded  sterile duraprep preparation on the right chest wa placed  a sterile drape around that wa also placed  the table wa flexed to open up the intercostal space  a second bronchoscopy wa performed to confirm placement of the doublelumen endotracheal tube  marcaine wa infused into all incision area prior to making an incision  the incision for the vat right middle lobectomy included a small 1cm incision for the auscultatory incision approximately 4 cm inferior to the inferior tip of the scapula  the camera port wa in the posterior axillary line in the eighth intercostal space through which a 5mm 30degree scope wa used  third incision wa an anterior port which wa approximately 2 cm inferior to the inframammary crease and the midclavicular line in the anterior sixth intercostal space and the third incision wa a utility port which wa a 4 cm long incision which wa approximately one rib space below the superior pulmonary vein  all of these incision were eventually created during the procedure  the initial incision wa the camera port through which under direct visualization an additional small 5mm port wa created just inferior to the anterior port  these two port were used to identify the chest wall lesion which were initially thought to be metastatic lesion  multiple biopsy of the chest wall lesion were taken and the decision wa made to also insert the auscultatory incision port  through these three incision the initial working of the diagnostic portion of the chest wall lesion wa performed  multiple biopsy were taken of the entire chest wall offer and specimen came back a negative  the right middle lobe wa noted to be adherent to the anterior chest wall  this area wa taken down and the entire pleural surface along this area wa taken down and sent for frozen pathologic analysis  this also returned a negative with only fibrotic tissue and a few lymphocyte within the fibrotic tissue but no tumor cell  based on this the decision wa made to not proceed with chest wall resection and continue with right middle lobectomy  following this the anterior port wa increased in size and the utility port wa made and meticulous dissection from an anterior to posterior direction wa performed  the middle lobe branch of the right superior pulmonary vein wa initially dissected and stapled with vascular load 45mm endogia stapler  following division of the right superior pulmonary vein the right middle lobe bronchus wa easily identified  initially this wa thought to be the main right middle lobe bronchus but in fact it wa the medial branch of the right middle lobe bronchus  this wa encircled and divided with a blue load stapler with a 45mm endogia  following division of this the pulmonary artery wa easily identified  two branch of the pulmonary artery were noted to be going into the right middle lobe  these were individually divided with a vascular load after encircling with a right angle clamp  the vascular staple load completely divided these arterial branch successfully from the main pulmonary artery trunk and following this an additional branch of the bronchus wa noted to be going to the right middle lobe  a fiberoptic bronchoscopy wa performed intraoperatively and confirmed that this wa in fact the lateral branch of the right middle lobe bronchus  this wa divided with a blue load stapler 45 mm endogia  following division of this the minor and major fissure were completed along the edge of the right middle lobe separating the right upper lobe from the right middle lobe a well a the right middle lobe from the right lower lobe  following complete division of the fissure the lobe wa put into an endogia bag and taken out through the utility port  following removal of the right middle lobe a meticulous lymph node dissection sampling wa performed excising the lymph node package in the 4r area a well a the 7 lymph node package  node station 8 or 9 node were easily identified therefore none were taken  the patient wa allowed to ventilate under water on the right lung with no obvious air leaking noted  a 19french blake wa placed into the posterior apical position and a 32french chest tube wa placed in the anteroapical position  following this the patient lung wa allowed to reexpand fully and the patient wa checked for air leaking once again  following this all the port were closed with 20 vicryl suture used for the deeper tissue and 30 vicryl suture wa used to reapproximate the subcutaneous tissue and 40 monocryl suture wa used to close the skin in a running subcuticular fashion  the patient tolerated the procedure well wa extubated in the operating room and taken to the recovery room in stable condition ,1.0

taking great care to pad all extremity  ted and venodynes were placed a prophylaxis against deep venous thrombosis  antibiotic were given for prophylaxis against surgical infectiona 52french bougie wa placed in the proximal esophagus by anesthesia above the cardioesophageal junction  a 2 cm midline incision wa made at the junction of the upper twothirds and lower onethird between the umbilicus and the xiphoid process  the fascia wa then cleared of subcutaneous tissue using a tonsil clamp  a 12 cm incision wa then made in the fascia gaining entry into the abdominal cavity without incident  two suture of 0 vicryl were then placed superiorly and inferiorly in the fascia and then tied to the special 12 mm hasson trocar fitted with a funnelshaped adaptor in order to occlude the fascial opening  pneumoperitoneum wa then established using carbon dioxide insufflation to a steady state of pressure of 16 mmhg  a 30degree laparoscope wa inserted through this port and used to guide the remaining trocarsthe remaining trocars were then placed into the abdomen taking care to make the incision along langers line spreading the subcutaneous tissue with a tonsil clamp and confirming the entry site by depressing the abdominal wall prior to insertion of the trocar  a total of 4 other 1011 mm trocars were placed  under direct vision 1 wa inserted in the right upper quadrant at the midclavicular line at a right supraumbilical position another at the left upper quadrant at the midclavicular line at a left supraumbilical position 1 under the right costal margin in the anterior axillary line and another laterally under the left costal margin on the anterior axillary line  all of the trocars were placed without difficulty  the patient wa then placed in reverse trendelenburg positionthe triangular ligament wa taken down sharply and the left lobe of the liver wa retracted superolaterally using a fan retractor placed through the right lateral cannula  the gastrohepatic ligament wa then identified and incised in an avascular plane  the dissection wa carried anteromedially onto the phrenoesophageal membrane  the phrenoesophageal membrane wa divided on the anterior aspect of the hiatal orifice  this incision wa extended to the right to allow identification of the right crus  then along the inner side of the crus the right esophageal wall wa freed by dissecting the cleavage planethe liberation of the posterior aspect of the esophagus wa started by extending the dissection the length of the right diaphragmatic crus  the par flaccida of the lesser omentum wa opened preserving the hepatic branch of the vagus nerve  this allowed free access to the crus left and right and the right posterior aspect of the esophagus and the posterior vagus nerveattention wa next turned to the left anterolateral aspect of the esophagus  at it left border the left crus wa identified  the dissection plane between it and the left aspect of the esophagus wa freed  the gastrophrenic ligament wa incised beginning the mobilization of the gastric pouch  by dissecting the intramediastinal portion of the esophagus we elongated the intraabdominal segment of the esophagus and reduced the hiatal herniathe next step consisted of mobilization of the gastric pouch  this required ligation and division of the gastrosplenic ligament and several short gastric vessel using the harmonic scalpel  this dissection started on the stomach at the point where the vessel of the greater curvature turned towards the spleen away from the gastroepiploic arcade  the esophagus wa lifted by a babcock inserted through the left upper quadrant port  careful dissection of the mesoesophagus and the left crus revealed a cleavage plane between the crus and the posterior gastric wall  confirmation of having opened the correct plane wa obtained by visualizing the spleen behind the esophagus  a onehalf inch penrose drain wa inserted around the esophagus and sewn to itself in order to facilitate retraction of the distal esophagus  the retroesophageal channel wa enlarged to allow easy passage of the antireflux valvethe 52french bougie wa then carefully lowered into the proximal stomach and the hiatal orifice wa repaired  two interrupted 0 silk suture were placed in the diaphragmatic crus to close the orificethe last part of the operation consisted of the passage and fixation of the antireflux valve  with anterior retraction on the esophagus using the penrose drain a babcock wa passed behind the esophagus from right to left  it wa used to grab the gastric pouch to the left of the esophagus and to pull it behind forming the wrap  the52french bougie wa used to calibrate the external ring  marcaine 05 wa injected 1 fingerbreadth anterior to the anterior superior iliac spine and around the wound for postanesthetic pain control  the skin incision wa approximated with skin staple  a dressing wa then applied  all surgical count were reported a correcthaving tolerated the procedure well the patient

there did appear to be old suture in a portion of the bowel most likely from a prior procedureindications  this patient is a 45yearold africanamerican gravida7 para3003 who is here for definitive treatment of chronic pelvic pain with a history of endometriosis  she did have a laparoscopic ablation of endometriosis on a laparoscopy and also ha a history of right salpingooophorectomy  she ha tried lupron and did stop secondary to the side effectsprocedure in detail  after informed consent wa obtained in layman term the patient wa taken back to the operating suite and placed under general anesthesia  she wa then prepped and draped in the sterile fashion and placed in the dorsal supine position  an indwelling foley catheter wa placed  with the skin knife an incision wa made removing the old cicatrix  a bovie wa used to carry the tissue through to the underlying layer of the fascia which wa incised in the midline and extended with the bovie  the rectus muscle wa then sharply and bluntly dissected off the superior aspect of the rectus fascia in the superior a well a the inferior aspect using the bovie  the rectus muscle wa then separated in the midline using a hemostat and the peritoneum wa entered bluntly  the peritoneal incision wa then extended superiorly and inferiorly with metzenbaum scissors with careful visualization of the bladder  at this point the intraabdominal cavity wa manually explored and the above finding were noted  a lahey clamp wa then placed on the fundus of the uterus and the uterus wa brought to the surgical field  the bowel wa then packed with moist laparotomy sponge  prior to this the filmy adhesion leftover were taken down  at this point the left round ligament wa identified grasped with two hemostat transected and suture ligated with 0 vicryl  at this point the broad ligament wa dissected down and the lost portion of the bladder flap wa created  the posterior aspect of the peritoneum wa also dissected  at this point the infundibulopelvic ligament wa isolated and three tie of 0 vicryl wa used to isolate the pedicle  two hemostat were then placed across the pedicle and this wa transected with the scalpel  this wa then suture ligated in heaney fashion  the right round ligament wa then identified and in the similar fashion two hemostat were placed across the round ligament and using the mayo scissors the round ligament wa transected and dissected down the broad ligament to create the bladder flap anteriorly a well a dissect the posterior peritoneum and isolate the round ligament  this wa then ligated with three tie of 0 vicryl  also incorporated in this wa the remnant from the previous right salpingooophorectomy  at this point the bladder flap wa further created with sharp dissection a well a the moist raytech to push the bladder down off the anterior portion of the cervixthe left uterine artery wa then skeletonized and a straight heaney wa placed  in a similar fashion the contralateral uterine artery wa skeletonized and straight heaney clamp wa placed  these ligament bilaterally were transected and suture ligated in a left heaney stitch  at this point curved masterson wa used to incorporate the cardinal ligament complex thus wa transected and suture ligated  straight masterson wa then used to incorporate the uterosacrals bilaterally and this wa also transected and suture ligated  prior to ligating the uterine artery the uterosacral artery were tagged bilaterally with 0 vicryl  at this point the roticulator wa placed across the vaginal cuff and snug underneath the entire cervix  the roticulator wa then clamped and removed and the staple line wa in place  this wa found to be hemostatic  a suture wa then placed through each cuff angle bilaterally and cardinal ligament complex wa found to be fixed to each apex bilaterally  at this point mccall culdoplasty wa performed with an 0 vicryl incorporating each uterosacral a well a the posterior peritoneum  there did appear to be good support on palpation  prior to this the specimen wa handed off and sent to pathology  at this point there did appear to be small amount of oozing at the right peritoneum  hemostasis wa obtained using a 0 vicryl in two single stitch  good hemostasis wa then obtained on the cuff a well a the pedicle  copious irrigation wa performed at this point with lactate ringer  the round ligament were then incorporated into the cuff bilaterally  again copious amount of irrigation wa performed and good hemostasis wa obtained  at this point the peritoneum wa reapproximated in a single interrupted stitch on the left and right lateral aspect to cover each pedicle bilaterally  at this point the bowel packing a well a moist raytech wa removed and while reapproximating the bowel it wa noted that there were multiple interloop bowel adhesion which were taken down using the metzenbaum scissors with good visualization of the underlying bowel  good hemostasis wa obtained of these site a well  the sigmoid colon wa then returned to it anatomic position and the omentum a well  the rectus muscle wa then reapproximated with two interrupted suture of 20 vicryl  the fascia wa then reapproximated with 0 vicryl in a running fashion from lateral to medial meeting in the midline  the scarpas fascia wa then closed with 30 plain in a running suture  the skin wa then reapproximated with 40 undyed vicryl in a subcuticular closure  this wa dressed with an opsite  the patient tolerated the procedure well  the sponge lap and needle were correct x2  after the procedure the patient wa extubated and brought out of general anesthesia  she will go to the floor where she will be followed postoperatively in the hospital ,2.0

diagnosed with a bcell lymphoma and then subsequently on workup noted to have a rightsided mass seeming to arise from the right diaphragm  he wa presented at tumor board where it wa thought upon review that day that he had a right nodular malignant mesothelioma  thus he wa offered a right thoracotomy and excision of mass with possible reconstruction of the diaphragm  he wa explained the risk benefit and alternative to this procedure  he wished to proceed so he wa brought to the operating rooman epidural catheter wa placed  he wa put in a supine position where scd and foley catheter were placed  he wa put under general endotracheal anesthesia with a doublelumen endotracheal tube  he wa given preoperative antibiotic then he wa placed in the left decubitus position and the area wa prepped and draped in the usual fashiona low thoracotomy in the 7th interspace wa made using the skin knife and then bovie cautery onto the middle of the rib and then with the alexander instrument the chest wa entered  upon entering the chest the chest wall retractor wa inserted and the cavity inspected  it appeared that the mass actually arose more from the right lower lobe and wa involving the diaphragm  he also had some marked lymphadenopathy  with these finding which were thought at that time to be more consistent with a bronchogenic carcinoma we proceeded with the intent to perform a right lower lobectomy and en bloc diaphragmatic resection  thus we mobilized the inferior pulmonary ligament and made our way around the hilum anteriorly and posteriorly  we also worked to open the fissure and tried to identify the artery going to the superior portion of the right lower lobe and basilar artery a well a the artery going to the right middle lobe  the posterior portion of the fissure ultimately divided with the single firing of a gia stapler with a blue load and with the final portion being divided between 20 tie  once we had clearly delineated the arterial anatomy we were able to pas a right angle around the artery going to the superior segment  this wa ligated in continuity with an additional stick tie in the proximal portion of 30 silk  this wa divided thus revealing a branched artery going to the basilar portion of the right lower lobe  this wa also ligated in continuity and actually doubly ligated  care wa taken to preserve the artery to the right and middle lobewe then turned our attention once again to the hilum to dissect out the inferior pulmonary vein  the superior pulmonary vein wa visualized a well  the right angle wa passed around the inferior pulmonary vein and this wa ligated in continuity with 20 silk and a 30 stick tie  upon division of this portion the specimen site had some bleeding which wa eventually controlled using several 30 silk suture  the bronchial anatomy wa defined  next we identified the bronchus going to the right lower lobe a well a the right middle lobe  a ta30 48 stapler wa then closed  the lung insufflated  the right middle lobe and right upper lobe were noted to inflate well  the stapler wa fired and the bronchus wa cut with a 10bladewe then turned our attention to the diaphragm  there wa a small portion of the diaphragm of approximately 4 to 5 cm ha involved with tumor and we bovied around this with at least 1 cm margin  upon going through the diaphragm it became clear that the tumor wa also involving the dome of the liver so after going around the diaphragm in it entirety we proceeded to wedge out the portion of liver that wa involved  it seemed that it would be a mucoid shallow portion  the bovie wa set to high cautery  the capsule wa entered and then using bovie cautery we wedged out the remaining portion of the tumor with a margin of normal liver  it did leave quite a shallow defect in the liver  hemostasis wa achieved with bovie cautery and gentle pressure  the specimen wa then taken off the table and sent to pathology for permanent  the area wa inspected for hemostasis  a 10flat jp wa placed in the abdomen at the portion of the wedge resection and 0 prolene wa used to close the diaphragmatic defect which wa under very little tension  a single 32 straight chest tube wa also placed  the lung wa seen to expand  we also noted that the incomplete fissure between the middle and upper lobe would prevent torsion of the right middle lobe  hemostasis wa observed at the end of the case  the chest tube wa irrigated with sterile water and there wa no air leak observed from the bronchial stump  the chest wa then closed with vicryl at the level of the intercostal muscle staying above the rib  the 20 vicryl wa used for the latissimus dorsi layer and the subcutaneous layer and 40 monocryl wa used to close the skin  the patient wa then brought to supine position extubated and brought to

2069,reason for consultation  new diagnosis of nonsmall cell lung cancerhistory of present illness  abcd is a very nice 47yearold gentleman without much past medical history who ha now been diagnosed with a new nonsmall cell lung cancer stage iv metastatic disease  we are consulted at this time to discus further treatment optionsabcd and his wife state that his history go back to approximately 2212 week ago when he developed some leftsided flank pain  initially he did not think much of this and tried to go about doing work and everything else but the pain gradually worsened  eventually this

hospital for further evaluation  on admission on 121908 a ct scan of the chest abdomen and pelvis wa done for full staging purpose  the ct scan of the chest showed an abnormal soft tissue mass in the right paratracheal region extending into the precarinal region the subcarinal region and the right hilum  this wa causing some compression on the inferior aspect of the svc and also some narrowing of the right upper lobe pulmonary artery  there wa an abnormal lymph node noted in the ap window and left hilar region  there wa another spiculated mass within the right upper lobe measuring 20 x 15 cm  there wa also an 8 mm noncalcified nodule noted in the posteriorinferior aspect of the left upper lobe suspicious for metastatic disease  there were area of atelectasis particularly in the right base  there wa also some mild ground glass opacity within the right upper lobe adjacent to the right hilum potentially representing focal area of pulmonary edema versus small infarction related to the right upper lobe pulmonary artery narrowing  there wa a small lucency adjacent to the medial aspect of the left upper lobe compatible with a small pneumothorax  in the abdomen there wa a mass involved in the left adrenal gland a well a a nodule involving the right adrenal gland both of which appeared necrotic compatible with metastatic tumor  all other structure appeared normal  on 122208 a ctguided biopsy of the left adrenal mass wa performed  pathology from this returned showing metastatic poorly differentiated nonsmall cell carcinoma  at this point we have been consulted to discus further

47yearold gentleman without much past medical history who now present with metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer  at this point he and his wife ask about whether this is curable disease and it wa difficult to inform that this wa not curable disease but would be treatable  his wife particularly had a very hard time with this prognosis  they preferred not to know the exact average a to how long someone life with this disease  i did offer chemotherapy a a way to treat this disease  chemotherapy ha been associated both with palliation of symptom a well a prolong survival  at this point he ha an excellent functional status and i think he would tolerate chemotherapy quite wellin term of chemotherapy i talked briefly about the side affect including but not limited to gi upset diarrhea nausea vomiting mucositis fatigue loss of appetite low blood count including the possible need for transfusion a well a the risk of infection which in some rare case can be fatal  i would likely use carboplatin and gemcitabine  this would be both medication given on day 1 with a dose of gemcitabine on day 8  this cycle will be repeated after 1week break so that the cycle last 21 day  the goal will be to complete 6 cycle of this a long a he is responding and tolerating the medicationin term of staging mr abcds had all the appropriate staging  a petct scan could be done but at this point would not provide much mean full information beyond the ct scan that we haveat this point his biggest issue is pain and he is getting a pain consult to help control his pain  he will be ready to be discharged from the hospital once his pain is under better control  a this is the holiday weekend i do not have a way of scheduling a followup appointment with them but i did give he and his wife my card and instructed them to call on monday  at that point we will get him in and i will also begin working on making arrangement for his chemotherapythank you very much for this interesting consult

posterior and anterior tonsillar pillar  also there wa a cryptic appearance of the tonsil but there wa no acute redness or exudate  retraction of the soft palate permitted evaluation of the nasopharynx with the mirror and the choanae were patent and there wa no adenoid tissue present  a very crowded pharynx wa appreciated  the tonsil were first removed using electrodissection technique  hemostasis wa achieved with the electrocautery and with suture of 0 plain catgut  the tonsil fossa were injected with 025 marcaine with 1200000 epinephrine  there already wa more room in the pharynx but the posterior pharyngeal wall wa still obscured by the soft palate and uvula  the uvula wa grasped with the alice clamp  i palpated the posterior edge of the hard palate and calculated removal of about a third of the length of the soft palate  we switched over from the bayonet cautery to the blunt needle tip electrocautery  the planned anterior soft palate incision wa marked out with the electrocautery from the left anterior tonsillar pillar rising upwards and then extending horizontally across the soft palate to include all of the uvula and a portion of the soft palate and the incision then extended across the midline and then inferiorly to meet the right anterior tonsillar pillar  this incision wa then deepened with the electrocautery on a cutting current  the uvular artery just to the right of the midline wa controlled with the suction electrocautery  the posterior soft palate incision wa made parallel to the anterior soft palate incision but wa made leaving a longer length of mucosa to permit closure of the palatoplasty  a portion of the redundant soft palate mucosa tissue also wa included with the resection specimen and the tissue including the soft palate and uvula wa included with the surgical specimen a the tonsil were sent to pathology  the tonsil fossa were injected with 025 marcaine with 1200000 epinephrine  the soft palate wa also injected with 025 marcaine with 1200000 epinephrine  the posterior tonsillar pillar were then brought forward to close to the anterior tonsillar pillar and these were sutured down to the tonsil bed with interrupted 0 plain catgut suture  the posterior soft palate mucosa wa advanced forward and brought up to the anterior soft palate incision and closure of the soft palate wound wa then accomplished with interrupted 30 chromic catgut suture  a much improved appearance of the oropharynx with a greatly improved airway wa appreciated  a moist tonsil sponge wa placed into the nasopharynx and the mouth gag wa removed  i removed the cottonoids from both nostril  speculum exam showed the inferior turbinate were large the septum wa tortuous and it angulated to the right and then sharply bent back to the left  the septum wa injected with 025 marcaine with 1200000 epinephrine using a separate syringe and needle  a 15 blade wa used to make a left cheilion incisionmucoperichondrium and mucoperiosteum were elevated with the cottle elevator  when we reached the deflected portion of the vomer this wa separated from the septal cartilage with a freer elevator  the rightsided mucoperiosteum wa elevated with the freer elevator and then with takahashi forceps and with the 4 mm osteotome the deflected portion of the septal bone from the vomer wa resected  this tissue also wa sent a a separate specimen to pathology  the intraseptal space wa irrigated with saline and suctioned  the nasal septal mucosal flap were then sutured together with a quilting suture of 40 plain catgut  i observed no evidence of purulent secretion or polyp formation within the nostril  the inferior turbinate were then both outfractured using a knife handle and now there wa a much more patent nasal airway on both side  there wa good support for the nasal tip and the dorsum and there wa good hemostasis within the nose  no packing wa used in the nostril  polysporin ointment wa introduced into both nostril  the mouth gag wa reintroduced and the pack removed from the nasopharynx  the nose and throat were irrigated with saline and suctioned  an orogastric tube wa placed and a moderate amount of clear fluid suctioned from the stomach and this tube wa removed  sponge and needle count were reported correct  the mouth gag having been withdrawn the patient wa then awakened and returned to recovery room in a satisfactory condition  he tolerated the operation excellently  estimated blood loss wa about 1520 cc  in the recovery room i observed that he wa moving air well and i spoke with

the preoperative evaluation the patient wa found to have visually significant and symptomatic dermatochalasis and brow ptosis causing mechanical ptosis and visual field obstruction  visual field testing showed  superior hemifield loss on the right and  superior hemifield loss on the left  these field loss resolved with upper eyelid taping which simulates the expected surgical correction  photodocumentation also showed the upper eyelid resting on the upper eyelash a well a a decrease in the effective superior marginal reflex distance  the risk benefit limitation alternative and expected improvement in symptom and visual field loss were discussed in preoperative evaluationdescription of procedure on the day of surgery the surgical site and procedure were verified by the physician with the patient  an informed consent wa signed and witnessed  emla cream wa applied to the eyelid and eyebrow region for 10 minute to provide skin anesthesia  two drop of topical proparacaine eye drop were placed on the ocular surface  the skin wa cleaned with alcohol prep pad  the patient received 3 to 4 ml of 2 lidocaine with epinephrine and 05 marcaine mixture to each upper lid  5 to 6 ml of local were also given to the brow region along the entire length  pressure wa applied over each site for 5 minute  the patient wa then prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion for oculoplastic surgerythe desired amount of redundant brow tissue to be excised wa carefully marked with a surgical marking pen on each side  the contour of the outline wa created to provide a greater temporal lift  care wa taken to preserve a natural contour to the brow shape consistent with the patient’s desired feature  using a 15 blade the initial incision wa placed just inside the superior most row of brow hair in parallel with the follicle growth orientation  the incision extended in a nasal to temporal fashion with the nasal portion incision being carried down to muscle and becoming progressively shallower toward the tail of the incision line  the dimension of the redundant tissue measured  horizontally and  vertically  the redundant tissue wa removed sharply with

the usual fashion  a previous midline incision wa extended from approximate level of l3 to s1  this wa in the midline  skin and subcutaneous tissue were debrided sharply  electrocautery provided hemostasis  electrocautery wa utilized to dissect through subcutaneous tissue of lumbar fascia  the lumbar fascia wa identified and split in the midline  subperiosteal dissection wa then carried out with electrocautery and  elevated from the suspected level of l3s1  once this wa exposed the transverse process a kocher clamp wa placed and a localizing crosstable xray confirmed the interspace between the spinous process of l3l4  once this wa completed a selfretaining retractor wa then placed  with palpation of the spinous process the l4 posterior element were noted to be significantly loosened and unstable  these were readily mobile with digital palpation  a rongeur wa then utilized to resect the spinous process from the inferior half of l3 to the superior half of s1  this bone wa morcellized and placed on the back table for utilization for bone grafting  the rongeur wa also utilized to thin the lamina from the inferior half of l3 to superior half of s1  once this wa undertaken the unstable posterior element of l4 were meticulously dissected free until wide decompression wa obtained  additional decompression wa extended from the level of the inferior half of l3 to the

ovary  there wa a normalappearing appendix and liver and the vesicouterine junction appeared within normal limit  there were significant adhesion from the small bowel to the bilateral adnexa in the posterior surface of the uterusprocedure  the patient wa taken to the operating room where a general anesthetic wa administered  she wa then positioned in the dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion  once the anesthetic wa found to be adequate a bimanual exam wa performed under anesthetic  next a weighted speculum wa placed in the vagina and anterior wall of the vagina wa elevated with the uterine sound and the anterior lip of the cervix wa grasped with a vulsellum tenaculum  the uterus wa then sounded to 12 cm  the cervix wa then serially dilated with hank dilator to a size 20 hank  next a telfa pad wa placed on the weighted speculum and a short curettage wa performed obtaining a large amount of endometrial tissue  next the uterine manipulator wa placed in the cervix and attached to the anterior lip of the cervix  at this point the vulsellum tenaculum and weighted speculum were removed  next attention wa turned to the abdomen where an approximately 2 cm incision wa made immediately inferior to the umbilicus  the superior aspect of the umbilicus wa grasped with a towel clamp and veress needle wa inserted through this incision  small amount of normal saline wa injected into veress needle and seemed to drop freely  so the veress needle wa connected to he co2 gas which wa started at the lower setting  it wa seen to flow freely with a normal resistance so the gas wa advanced to the higher setting  the abdomen wa then insufflated to an adequate distention  next the veress needle wa removed and a size 11 step trocar wa inserted  next the introducer wa removed from the trocar and the laparoscope wa inserted through this port and the port wa also connected to the co2 gas  at this point the initial operative finding were seen  next a size 5 step trocar wa inserted approximately two fingerbreadth above the pubic symphysis in the midline  this wa done by making a 1 cm incision with the skin knife introducing a veress needle

along with the grasper wa used to meticulously address the adhesion along the right adnexa in the posterior culdesac  care wa taken at all time to avoid the bowel and the ureter  the fallopian tube appeared massively scarred and completely obliterated from disease  after the right adnexa had been freed to the point where we could visualize the ovary and the posterior culdesac wa clearing off then we could visualize the uterosacral ligament  attention wa turned to the left adnexa which appeared to contain a cystic structure but it wa unclear at the beginning of the procedure what the structure wa  adhesion were carefully taken down from the bowel to the left fallopian tube and ovary and sidewall  the adhesion were then carefully removed from the inferior aspect of the ovary also with the harmonic scalpel  at intermittent point throughout the procedure the suction irrigator wa used to irrigate and suck blood and irrigation out of the pelvis to watch for any bleeding  at this point the harmonic scalpel wa removed and another laparoscopic needle with a 60 cc syringe wa inserted and this wa used to aspirate approximately 30 cc of serosanguineous fluid from the cystic structure  next the needle wa removed and the ligature device wa inserted  this wa used to clamp across the fallopian tube initially and then after the fallopian tube wa ligated the uterovarian ligament wa clamped and ligated with the ligature device  next the fallopian tube wa removed from the ovary with the ligature device in approximately 3 clamping and ligation  then the attention wa turned to the inferior aspect of the ovary  first the infundibulopelvic ligament wa identified clamped with a ligature device and ligated  next the ovary wa bluntly dissected from the ovarian fossa with attention to the left ureter  next the ligature device wa used to clamp and ligate the broad ligament immediately inferior to the ovary across  then the ovary wa completely bluntly dissected out of the ovarian fossa and completely separated from the pelvis  this wa grasped with a clamp  the ligature device wa removed from the 12 and a endocatch bag wa inserted to the size 12 port  the left

to obtain hemostasis  once the bursa wa seen it wa removed with a rongeur and subscapular tendon could be easily visualized  at this point the rotator cuff in the subacromial region wa evaluated  there wa noted to be a large rotator cuff which wa irreparable  there wa eburnated bone on the greater tuberosity noted  the articular surface could be visualized  the biceps tendon wa intact  there wa noted to be diffuse discolored synovium around this a well a some fraying of the tendon in the intraarticular surface  the under surface of the acromion it wa felt there wa mild ware on this a well  at this point the subscapular tendon wa then taken off using bovie cautery and metzenbaum scissors that wa tied with metzenbaum suture  it wa separated from the capsule to have a two layered repair at closure  the capsule wa also reflected posterior  at this point the glenoid surface could be easily visualized  it wa evaluated and had good cartilage contact and appeared to be intact  the humeral head wa evaluated  there wa noted to be ware of the cartilage and eburnated bone particularly in the central portion of the humeral head  at this point decision wa made to proceed with the arthroplasty since the rotator cuff tear wa irreparable and there wa significant ware of the humoral head  the arm wa adequately positioned  an oscillating saw wa used to make the head articular cut  this wa done at the margin of the articular surface with the anatomic neck  this wa taken down to appropriate level until this articular surface wa adequately removed  at this point the intramedullary canal and cancellous bone could be easily visualized  the opening hand reamer were then used and this wa advanced to a size 10  under direct visualization this wa performed easily  at this point the

tubeoperative procedure in detail  after obtaining informed consent from the patient including a thorough explanation of the risk and benefit of the aforementioned procedure the patient wa taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia wa administered  prior to administration of general anesthesia the patient had an epidural anesthesia placed  in addition he had a duallumen endotracheal tube placed  the patient wa placed in the supine position to begin the procedure  his abdomen and chest were prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion  after applying sterile dressing a 10blade scalpel wa used to make an upper midline incision from the level of the xiphoid to just below the umbilicus  dissection wa carried down through the linea using bovie electrocautery  the abdomen wa opened  next a balfour retractor wa positioned a well a a mechanical retractor  next our attention wa turned to freeing up the stomach  in an attempt to do so we identified the right gastroepiploic artery and arcade  we incised the omentum and retracted it off the stomach and gastroepiploic arcade  the omentum wa divided using suture ligature with 20 silk  we did this along the greater curvature and then moved to the lesser curvature where the short gastric artery were taken down with ligation using 20 silk  next we turned our attention to performing a kocher maneuver  this wa done and the stomach wa freed up  we took down the falciform ligament a well a the caudate attachment to the diaphragm  we enlarged the diaphragmatic hiatus so a to be able to place approximately 3 finger into the chest  we also did a portion of the esophageal dissection from the abdomen into the chest area  the esophagus and the esophageal hiatus were identified in the abdomen  we next turned our attention to the left gastric artery  the left gastric artery wa identified at the base of the stomach  we first took the left gastric vein by ligating and dividing it using 0 silk tie  the left gastric artery wa next taken using suture ligature with silk tie followed by 20 stick tie reinforcement  at this point the stomach wa freely mobile  we then turned our attention to performing our jejunostomy feeding tube  a 20 vicryl pursestring wa placed in the jejunum approximately 20 cm distal to the ligament of treitz  we then used bovie electrocautery to open the jejunum at this site  we placed a 16french red rubber catheter through this site  we tied down in place  we then used 30 silk suture to perform a witzel  next the loop of jejunum wa tacked up to the abdominal wall using 20 silk tie  after doing so and pulling the feeding jejunostomy out through the skin and securing it appropriately we turned our attention to closing the abdomen  this wa done with 1 prolene  we put in a 2nd layer of 20 vicryl  the skin wa closed with 40 monocrylnext we turned our attention to performing the thoracic portion of the procedure  the patient wa placed in the left lateral decubitus position  the right chest wa prepped and draped appropriately  we then used a 10 blade scalpel to make an incision in a posterolateral nonmusclesparing fashion  dissection wa carried down to the level of the rib with bovie electrocautery  next the rib were counted and the 5th interspace wa entered  the lung wa deflated  we placed standard chest retractor  next we incised the peritoneum over the esophagus  we dissected the esophagus to just above the azygos vein  the azygos vein in fact wa taken with 0 silk ligature and reinforced with 20 stick tie  a mentioned we dissected the esophagus both proximally and distally down to the level of the hiatus  after doing this we backed our ng tube out to above the level where we planned to perform our pursestring  we used an automatic pursestring and applied  we then transected the proximal portion of the stomach with metzenbaum scissors  we secured our pursestring and then placed a 28 anvil in the divided proximal portion of the esophagus  the pursestring wa then tied down without difficulty  next we tabularized our stomach using a 80 gia stapler  after doing so we chose a portion of the stomach more distally and opened it using bovie electrocautery  we placed our eea stapler through it and then punched out through the gastric wall  we connected our anvil to the eea stapler  this wa then secured appropriately  we checked to make sure that there wa appropriate muscle apposition  we then fired the stapler  we obtained 2 complete ring 1 of the esophagus and 1 of the stomach which were sent for pathology  we also sent the gastroesophageal specimen for pathology  of note wa the fact that the frozen section showed no evidence of tumor and in the proximal distal margin  we then turned our attention to closing the gastrostomy opening  this wa closed with 20 vicryl in a running fashion  we then buttressed this with serosal 30 vicryl interrupted suture  we returned the newly constructed gastroesophageal anastomosis into the chest and covered it by covering the pleura over it  next we placed two 28french chest tube 1 anteriorly and 1 posteriorly taking care not to place it near the anastomosis  we then closed the chest with 2 vicryl in an interrupted figureofeight fashion  the lung wa brought up  we closed the muscle layer with 0 vicryl followed by 0 vicryl then we closed the subcutaneous layer with 20 vicryl and the skin with 40 monocryl  sterile dressing wa applied  the instrument and sponge count wa correct at the end of the case  the patient tolerated the procedure well and wa extubated

3294,procedure  left heart catheterization left and right coronary angiography left ventricular angiography and intercoronary stenting of the right coronary arteryprocedure in detail  the patient wa brought to the catheterization laboratory  after informed consent he wa medicated with versed and fentanyl  the right groin wa prepped and draped and infiltrated with 2 xylocaine  percutaneously 6french arterial sheath wa placed  selective native left and right coronary angiography wa performed followed by left ventricular angiography  the patient had a totally occluded right coronary  we initially started with a jr4 guide  we were able to a sport wire through the total occlusion and saw a very tight stenosis  we were able to get a 30 x 13 mm power saver balloon into the stenosis and dilated  we then attempted to put a 30 x 12 mm stent across the stenosis but we had very little guide support the guide kept coming out  we then switched to an al1 guide and that too did not enable u to get anything to cross this lesion  we finally had to go an al2 guide we were concerned that this could cause some proximal dissection  that guided seated we did have initial difficulty getting the wire back across the stenosis and we did see a little staining suggesting we did have some tearing from the guide tip  the surgeon were put on notice in case we could not get this vessel open but we were able to recross with a sport wire  we then redilated the area of stenosis and with good guide support we were able to get a 30 x 23 mm vision stent where the lesion wa and postdilated it to 18 atmosphere  routine angiography did show that the distal posterolateral branch seems to be occluded whether this wa from distal wire dissection or distal thrombosis wa unclear but we were able to rewire that area and get a 25 x12 vision balloon and dilate the area and reestablish flow to the small segment  we then came back because of the residual dissection proximal to the first stent and put a 30 x15 mm vision stent at 18 atmosphere  final angiography showed resolution of the dissection  we could see a little staining extrinsic to the stent  no perforation and excellent flow  during the intervention we did give a bolus and drip of angiomax  at the end of the procedure we stopped the angiomax and gave 600 mg of plavix  we did a right femoral angiogram however the angioseal plug could not take so we used manual pressure and a femostop  we transported the patient to his room in stable conditionangiographic data  left main coronary is normal  left anterior descending artery ha a fair amount of wall disease proximally about 50 to 60 stenosis of the lad before it bifurcates into diagonal  the diagonal doe appear to have about 50 osteal stenosis  there is a lot of plaquing further down the diagonal but good flow  the rest of the lad looked good pas the proximal 60 stenosis and after the diagonal branch  circumflex artery wa nondominant vessel consisting of an obtuse marginal vessel  the first obtuse marginal had a long 50 narrowing and then the av groove branch wa free of any disease  some mild collateral to the right were seen  right coronary angiography revealed a total occlusion of the right coronary just about 05 cm after it origin  after we got a wire across the area of occlusion we could see some thrombosis and a 99 stenosis just at the curve  following the balloon angioplasty we established good flow down the distal vessel  we still had about residual 70 stenosis  when we had to go back with the al2 guide we could see a little bit of staining in the proximal portion of the vessel that we did not notice previously and we felt that the tip of the guide caused a little bit of intimal dissection  we redilated and then deployed  repeat angiography now did show some hang up off dye distally  we never did have the wire that far down so this wa probably felt to be due to distal embolization of some thrombus  after deploying the stent we had total resolution of the original lesion  we then directed our attention to the posterolateral branch which the remainder of the vessel wa patent giving off a large pda  the posterolateral branch appeared to be occluded in it mid portion  we got a wire through and dilated this  we then came back and put a second stent in the proximal area of the right coronary proximal and abutting to the previous stent  repeat angiography now showed no significant dissection a little bit of contrast getting extrinsic to the stent probably in a little subintimal pouch but this wa excluded by the stent  there were no filling defect in the stent and excellent flow  the distal posterolateral branch did open up although it wa little underfilled and there may have been some mild residual disease thereimpression  atherosclerotic heart disease with total occlusion of right coronary successfully stented to zero residual with repair of a small proximal dissection  minor distal disease of the posterolateral branch and 60 proximal left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis and 50 diagonal stenosis along with 50 stenosis of the first obtuse marginal branch ,1.0

proximal  the two dorsal cut were longer than the plantar cut in order to accommodate for the future internal fixation  the wedge of bone that wa formed between the two dorsal cut wa resected and passed off to pathology for further examination  the head of the first right metatarsal wa then impacted on the shaft of the first right metatarsal and provisionally stabilized with two wire from the osteomed system  the wire were inserted from a dorsal distal to plantar proximal direction through the dorsal osteotomy  the wire were also used a guidewires for the insertion of two 16mm proximally threaded cannulated screw from the osteomed system  the 2 screw were inserted using ao technique  upon insertion of the screw the two wire were removed  fixation of the osteotomy on the table wa found to be excellent  the area wa copiously flushed with saline and range of motion wa reevaluated and wa found to be much improved from the preoperative level without any significant restriction  the cartilaginous surface on the base of the first right metatarsal and the base of the proximal phalanx were also fenestrated in order to induce some cartilaginous formation  the capsule and periosteal tissue were then reapproximated with 30 vicryl suture material 40 vicryl wa used to approximate the subcutaneous tissue  steristrips were used to approximate and reinforce the skin edge  at this time the right ankle tourniquet wa deflated  immediate hyperemia wa noted in the entire right lower extremity upon deflation of the cuff  the patient surgical site wa then covered with xeroform copious amount of fluff and kling stockinette and ace bandage  the patient right foot wa placed in a surgical shoe and the patient wa then transferred to the recovery room under the care of the anesthesia team with her vital sign stable and neurovascular status at appropriate level  the patient wa given instruction and education on how to continue caring for her right foot surgery at home  the patient wa also given pain medication instruction on how to control her postoperative pain  the patient wa eventually discharged from hospital according to nursing protocol and wa advised to follow up with dr

systemmonitoring  sseps and the eps were availableindications  the patient is a 12yearold female who ha had a very dysmorphic scoliosis  she had undergone a workup with an mri which showed no evidence of cord abnormality  therefore the risk benefit and alternative were discussed with surgery with the mother to include infection bleeding nerve injury vascular injury spinal cord injury with catastrophic loss of motor function and bowel and bladder control  i also discussed  and need for revision surgery  the mom understood all this and wished to proceedprocedure  the patient wa taken to the operating room and underwent general anesthetic  she then had line placed and wa then placed in a prone position  monitoring wa then set up and it wa then noted that we could not obtain motorevoked potential  the sseps were clear and were compatible with the preoperative but no preoperative motor had been done and there wa a concern that possibly this could be from the result of the positioning  it wa then determined at that time that we would go ahead and proceed to wake her up and make sure she could move her foot  she wa then lightened under anesthesia and she could indeed dorsiflex and plantarflex her foot so therefore it wa determined to go ahead and proceed with only monitoring with the ssepsthe patient after being prepped and draped sterilely a midline incision wa made and dissection wa carried down  the dissection utilized a combination of hand instrument and electrocautery and dissected out along the lamina and up to the transverse process  this occurred from t2l2  fluoroscopy wa brought in to verify position and level  once this wa done and all bleeding wa controlled retractor were then placed  attention wa then turned towards placing screw first on the left side  lumbar screw were placed at the junction of the transverse process and the facet under fluoroscopic guidance  the area wa opened with a high speed burr and then the track wa defined with a blunt probe and a balltipped feeler wa then utilized to verify all wall were intact  they were then tapped and then screw were then placed  this technique wa used at l1 and l2 both the right and left  at t12 a direct straightahead technique wa utilized where the facet wa removed and then the position wa chosen under the fluoroscopy and then it wa spurred the track wa defined and then probed and tapped and it wa felt to be in good position  two screw in the right and left were placed at t12 a well reduction screw on the left  the same technique wa used for t11 where right and left screw were placed a well a t10 on the left  at t9 a screw wa placed on the left and this wa a reduction screw  on the left at t8 a screw could not be placed due to the dysmorphic nature of the pedicle  it wa not felt to be intact therefore a screw wa left out of this  on the right a thoracic screw wa placed a well a at 7 and 6  this wa the dysmorphic portion of this  screw were attempted to be placed up they could not be placed so attention wa then turned towards placing pedicle hook  pedicle hook were done by first making a box out of the pedicle removing the complete pedicle feeling the undersurface of the pedicle with a probe and then seating the hook  upgoing pedicle hook were placed at t3 t4 and t5  a downgoing laminar hook wa placed at the t7 level  screw had been placed at t6 and t7 on the right  an upgoing pedicle hook wa also placed at t3 on the right and then downgoing laminar hook were placed at t2  this wa done by first using a transverse process lamina finder to go around the transverse process and then  laminar hook  once all hook were in place spinal osteotomy were performed at t7t8 and t8t9  this wa the level of the kyphosis to bring her back out of her kyphoscoliosis  first the ligamentum flavum wa resected using a large kerrisons  next the laminotomy wa performed and then a kerrison wa used to remove the ligamentum flavum at the level of the facet  once this wa accomplished a laminotomy wa performed by removing more of the lamina and to create a small wedge that could be closed down later to correct the kyphosis  this wa then brought out with resection of bone out to the foramen doing a foraminotomy to free up the foramen on both side  this wa done also between the t8t9  once this wa completed gelfoam wa then placed  next we observed and measured and contoured  the rod were then seated on the left and then a derotation maneuver wa performed  hook had come loose so the rod wa removed on the left  the hook were then replaced and the rod wa reseated  again it wa derotated to give excellent correction  hook were then well seated underneath and therefore they were then locked  a second rod wa then chosen on the right and wa measured contoured and then seated  next once this wa done the rod were locked in the midsubstance and then the downgoing pedicle hook which had been placed at t7 wa then helped to compress t8 a wa the pedicle screw and then this compressed the osteotomy site quite nicely  next distraction wa then utilized to further correct at the spine and to correct on the left the left concave curve which gave excellent correction  on the right compression wa used to bring it down and then in the lower lumbar area distraction and compression were used to level out l2  once this wa done all screw were tightened  fluoroscopy wa then brought in to verify l1 wa level and the first rib were also level and it gave a nice balanced spine  everything wa copiously irrigated   next a wakeup test wa performed and the patient wa then noted to flex and extend the knee a well a dorsiflex and plantar flex both the foot  the patient wa then again sedated and brought back under general anesthesia  next a highspeed burr wa used for decortication  after final tightening had been accomplished and then allograft bone and autograft bone were mixed together with 10 ml of iliac crest aspirate and were placed into the wound  the open canal area had been protected with gelfoam  once this wa accomplished the deep fascia wa closed with multiple figureofeight 1 oversewn with a running 1  were then placed in the subcutaneous space which were then closed with 30 vicryl and then the skin wa closed with 30 monocryl and dermabond  sterile dressing wa applied  drain had been placed in the subcutaneous layer x2  the patient during the case had no change in the sseps had a normal wakeup test and had received ancef and clindamycin during the case  she wa taken from the operating room in good condition ,2.0

 350 ccanesthesia  general endotracheal anesthesiacomplications  nonecounts  correctspecimens sent  noneclinical history  the patient is a 77yearold male who wa admitted through the emergency room for progressive weakness and falling  he wa worked by the neurologist dr x and found to have cervical spondylosis with myelopathy  i wa consulted and elected to do a lumbar and cervical myelogram ct scan which showed lumbar stenosis but also cervical stenosis with more pathology anteriorly than posteriorly  the patient had worst disease at level c3c4 c4c5 and c5c6  the patient wa significantly weak and almost quadriparetic stronger on the right side than on the left side  i thought that surgery wa indicated to prevent progressive neurological deterioration a well a to prevent a central cord syndrome if the patient were to get into a motor vehicle accident or simply fall  conservative management wa not an option  the patient wa preoped and consented and wa medically cleared  i discussed the indication risk and benefit of the surgery with the patient and the patient family  the risk of bleeding hoarseness swallowing difficulty pseudoarthrosis a well a plate migration and hardware failure were all discussed with the patient  an informed consent wa obtained from the patient a such  he wa brought into the or today for the operative proceduredescription of procedure  the patient wa brought into the or intubated and given a general anesthetic  intubation wa done under cspine precaution  the patient received preoperative vancomycin and decadron  he wa hooked up to the ssep apparatus and had poor baseline and delayswith a large a shoulder roll i extended the patient neck and landmark incision in crease in the right upper neck and the area wa then prepped and sterilely draped  all the line had been put in and the arm were paddedusing a knife and cautery i took the incision down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue and arrived at the cervical spine  prominent osteophyte at c5c6 wa noted lesser at c4c5  intraoperative xray confirmed our level and we were fully exposed from c3c6trimline retractor were put in and i cut the disc out a well a removed the superficial hyperstatic bone and osteophyteswith the drill i performed a superficial discectomy and endplate resection curetting the endplate a i went  i then brought in the microscope under the microscopic guidance firmly removed the end plate and drilled through the posterior longitudinal ligament to decompress the spinal cord  worst finding at c3c4 followed c5c6 and then c4c5  excellent thecal sac decompression wa achieved and foraminal decompression wa also achieved  with change in intraoperative monitoring a microscope wa used for this decompressive procedurethe patient wa very oozy throughout this procedure and during the decompression part the oozing wa constant  this wa partly due to the patient cancellous bone but he had been on aspirin which wa stopped only 2 day ago and the option wa not available to wait 2 to 3 week which would have made this man worse simply over time  i thus elected to give him ddavp platelet and used horsley bone wax for excellent hemostasis  this took literally halfanhour to an hour and added to the complexity and difficulty of this case  eventually with blood pressure controlled and all the other parameter under control bleeding wa somewhat slowi then selected two 10 and one 9mm cadaveric allograft which had soaking in bacitracin solution  these were trimmed to the desired dimension and under slight distraction these were tapped into position  excellent graft alignment wa achievedi now brought in a depuy titanium eagle plate and i fixed it to the spine from c3 to c6  fourteen millimeter screw were used all the screw were tightened and torqued  the patient bone quality wa poor but the screw did torque appropriately  i inspected the plate controlled the hemostasis assessed postfixation xray and wa really happy with the screw length and the overall alignmentthe wound wa irrigated with antibiotic solution a jacksonpratt drain 10french wa put in with trocar  decision wa made to start the closure  so i closed the platysma with 30 vicryl and used staple for the skin  a simple primapore or medpore dressing wa applied  the patient wa extubated in the or and taken to the psu in stable medical conditionwhen i saw the patient in the icu he wa awake alert and moving all four extremity somewhat weak on the left side  he had done well from the surgery  blood loss wa 350 cc  all instrument needle and sponge count were correct  no complication no change in intraoperative monitoring  no specimen were sentthe patient wife wa spoken to and fully appraised of the intraoperative finding and the expected prognosis  the patient will be kept npo tonight and will gradually advance his diet and also will gradually advance his activity  i will keep him on decadron and keep the collar on  i do not think there is need for halo rest  we will be obtaining formal cspine film in the morning  prognosis is guarded but favorable at this time ,1.0

with some constitutional symptom including fever fatigue abdominal discomfort and adenopathy on physical examination  the following are in the differential diagnosis  acute proctitis and  proctocolitisacute hiv seroconversion  this subject is sexually active and report inconsistent condom use  gastrointestinal symptom have recently been reported commonly in patient with a history of hiv seroconversion  the rectal symptom of bleeding and pain are not common with hiv and an alternative diagnosis would be requiredperirectal abscess  a patient with a history of receptive anal intercourse is at risk for developing a perirectal abscess either from trauma or a concurrent std  the patient could experience more systemic symptom with fever and malaise a found with this patient  however the physical examination did not reveal the typical localized area of pain and edemadiagnosis  the subject had rectal culture obtained which were positive for neisseria gonorrhoeae  an hiv elisa wa positive a wa the rna pcrdiscussion  this patient demonstrates a number of key issue to consider when caring for an adolescent or young adult  first the patient utilized the emergency department for care a opposed to identifying a primary care provider  although not ideal in many circumstance testing for hiv infection is crucial when there is suspicion since many newly diagnosed patient identify earlier contact with health care provider when hiv counseling and testing were not performed  second this young man ha had both male and female sexual partner  a young people explore their sexuality asking about partner in an open nonjudgmental manner without applying label is integral to helping the young person discus their sexual behavior  assuming heterosexuality is a major barrier to disclosure for many young people who have samesex attraction  third screening for std must take into account sexual behavior  although urinebased screening ha expanded testing of young people it miss anal and pharyngeal infection  if a young person is only having receptive oral or anal intercourse urine screening is insufficient to rule out std  fourth this young man had both localized and systemic symptom  a his anal symptom were most suggestive of a current std performing an hiv test should be part of the standard evaluation  in addition a acute infection is on the differential diagnosis pcr testing should also be considered  the care provided to this young man included the following  he wa treated presumptively for proctitis with both im ceftriaxone a well a oral doxycycline to treat n gonorrhoeae and c trachomatis  ceftriaxone wa chosen due to the recent report of resistant n gonorrhoeae  at the time of the diagnosis the young man wa given the opportunity to meet with the case manager from the adolescentspecific hiv program  the case manager linked this young man directly to care after providing brief counseling and support  the case manager maintained contact with the young man until his first clinical visit four day later  over the subsequent three month the young man had two set of laboratory testing to stage his hiv

stent three day ago and this persisted after two sublingual nitroglycerin when i spoke to her  i advised her to call 911 which she did  while waiting for 911 she wa attended to by a physician who is her neighbor and he advised her to take the third nitroglycerin and that apparently relieved her pain  by the time she presented here she is currently painfree and is feeling wellpast cardiac history  the patient ha been having arm pain for several month  she underwent an exercise stress echocardiogram within the last several month with me which wa equivocal but then she had a nuclear stress test which showed inferobasilar ischemia  i had originally advised her for a heart catheterization but she wanted medical therapy so we put her on a betablocker  however her arm pain symptom accelerated and she had some jaw pain so she presented to the emergency room  on 081608 she ended up having a cardiac catheterization and that showed normal left main 80  mid lad lesion circumflex normal and rca totally occluded in the mid portion and there were collateral from the left to the right a well a right to right to that area  the decision wa made to transfer  her a she may be having collateral

angina characterized with arm pain who underwent recent left anterior descending percutaneous coronary intervention and ha now had recurrence of that arm pain post stenting to the left anterior descending artery and it may be that she is continuing to have collateral insufficiency of the right coronary artery  in any case given this unstable presentation requiring three sublingual nitroglycerin before she wa even pain free i am going to admit her to the hospital and there is currently no evidence requiring acute reperfusion therapy  we will continue her betablocker and i cannot increase the dose because she is bradycardic already  aspirin plavix valsartan lipitor and norvasc  i am going to add imdur and watch headache a she apparently had some on nitro paste before and we will rule out mi although there is a little suspicion  i suppose it is possible that she ha noncardiac arm pain but that seems le likely a it ha been nitrate responsive and seems exertionally related and the other possibility may be that we end up needing to put in a pacemaker so we can maximize betablocker use for antianginal effect  my concern is that there is persistent right coronary artery ischemia not helped by left anterior descending percutaneous coronary intervention which wa severely stenotic and she doe have normal lv function  she will continue the glucosamine for her arthritis

diagnosed with a bcell lymphoma and then subsequently on workup noted to have a rightsided mass seeming to arise from the right diaphragm  he wa presented at tumor board where it wa thought upon review that day that he had a right nodular malignant mesothelioma  thus he wa offered a right thoracotomy and excision of mass with possible reconstruction of the diaphragm  he wa explained the risk benefit and alternative to this procedure  he wished to proceed so he wa brought to the operating rooman epidural catheter wa placed  he wa put in a supine position where scd and foley catheter were placed  he wa put under general endotracheal anesthesia with a doublelumen endotracheal tube  he wa given preoperative antibiotic then he wa placed in the left decubitus position and the area wa prepped and draped in the usual fashiona low thoracotomy in the 7th interspace wa made using the skin knife and then bovie cautery onto the middle of the rib and then with the alexander instrument the chest wa entered  upon entering the chest the chest wall retractor wa inserted and the cavity inspected  it appeared that the mass actually arose more from the right lower lobe and wa involving the diaphragm  he also had some marked lymphadenopathy  with these finding which were thought at that time to be more consistent with a bronchogenic carcinoma we proceeded with the intent to perform a right lower lobectomy and en bloc diaphragmatic resection  thus we mobilized the inferior pulmonary ligament and made our way around the hilum anteriorly and posteriorly  we also worked to open the fissure and tried to identify the artery going to the superior portion of the right lower lobe and basilar artery a well a the artery going to the right middle lobe  the posterior portion of the fissure ultimately divided with the single firing of a gia stapler with a blue load and with the final portion being divided between 20 tie  once we had clearly delineated the arterial anatomy we were able to pas a right angle around the artery going to the superior segment  this wa ligated in continuity with an additional stick tie in the proximal portion of 30 silk  this wa divided thus revealing a branched artery going to the basilar portion of the right lower lobe  this wa also ligated in continuity and actually doubly ligated  care wa taken to preserve the artery to the right and middle lobewe then turned our attention once again to the hilum to dissect out the inferior pulmonary vein  the superior pulmonary vein wa visualized a well  the right angle wa passed around the inferior pulmonary vein and this wa ligated in continuity with 20 silk and a 30 stick tie  upon division of this portion the specimen site had some bleeding which wa eventually controlled using several 30 silk suture  the bronchial anatomy wa defined  next we identified the bronchus going to the right lower lobe a well a the right middle lobe  a ta30 48 stapler wa then closed  the lung insufflated  the right middle lobe and right upper lobe were noted to inflate well  the stapler wa fired and the bronchus wa cut with a 10bladewe then turned our attention to the diaphragm  there wa a small portion of the diaphragm of approximately 4 to 5 cm ha involved with tumor and we bovied around this with at least 1 cm margin  upon going through the diaphragm it became clear that the tumor wa also involving the dome of the liver so after going around the diaphragm in it entirety we proceeded to wedge out the portion of liver that wa involved  it seemed that it would be a mucoid shallow portion  the bovie wa set to high cautery  the capsule wa entered and then using bovie cautery we wedged out the remaining portion of the tumor with a margin of normal liver  it did leave quite a shallow defect in the liver  hemostasis wa achieved with bovie cautery and gentle pressure  the specimen wa then taken off the table and sent to pathology for permanent  the area wa inspected for hemostasis  a 10flat jp wa placed in the abdomen at the portion of the wedge resection and 0 prolene wa used to close the diaphragmatic defect which wa under very little tension  a single 32 straight chest tube wa also placed  the lung wa seen to expand  we also noted that the incomplete fissure between the middle and upper lobe would prevent torsion of the right middle lobe  hemostasis wa observed at the end of the case  the chest tube wa irrigated with sterile water and there wa no air leak observed from the bronchial stump  the chest wa then closed with vicryl at the level of the intercostal muscle staying above the rib  the 20 vicryl wa used for the latissimus dorsi layer and the subcutaneous layer and 40 monocryl wa used to close the skin  the patient wa then brought to supine position extubated and brought to
