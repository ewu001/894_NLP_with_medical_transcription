Pneumonia, failed outpatient treatment.,2.  Hypoxia.,3.  Rheumatoid arthritis.,DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Atypical pneumonia, suspected viral.,2.  Hypoxia.,3.  Rheumatoid arthritis.,4.  Suspected mild stress-induced adrenal insufficiency.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , This very independent 79-year old had struggled with cough, fevers, weakness, and chills for the week prior to admission.  She was seen on multiple occasions at Urgent Care and in her physician's office.  Initial x-ray showed some mild diffuse patchy infiltrates.  She was first started on Avelox, but had a reaction, switched to Augmentin, which caused loose stools, and then three days prior to admission was given daily 1 g Rocephin and started on azithromycin.  Her O2 saturations drifted downward.  They were less than 88% when active; at rest, varied between 88% and 92%.  Decision was made because of failed outpatient treatment of pneumonia.  Her medical history is significant for rheumatoid arthritis.  She is on 20 mg of methotrexate every week as well as Remicade every eight weeks.  Her last dose of Remicade was in the month of June.  Hospital course was relatively unremarkable.  CT scan was performed and no specific focal pathology was seen.  Dr. X, pulmonologist was consulted.  He also was uncertain as to the exact etiology, but viral etiology was most highly suspected.  Because of her loose stools, C. difficile toxin was ordered, although that is pending at the time of discharge.  She was continued on Rocephin IV and azithromycin.  Her fever broke 18 hours prior to discharge, and O2 saturations improved, as did her overall strength and clinical status.  She was instructed to finish azithromycin.  She has two pills left at home.  She is to follow up with Dr. X in two to three days.  Because she is on chronic prednisone therapy, it was suspected that she was mildly adrenal insufficient from the stress of her pneumonia.  She is to continue the increased dose of prednisone at 20 mg (up from 5 mg per day).  We will consult her rheumatologist as to whether to continue her methotrexate, which we held this past Friday.  Methotrexate is known on some occasions to cause pneumonitis.","cardiovascular / pulmonary, adrenal insufficiency, hypoxia, cough, fevers, weakness, chills, atypical pneumonia, loose stools, rheumatoid arthritis, azithromycin, arthritis, pneumonia, "

4,20,4746, Right upper lung lobectomy.  Mediastinal lymph node dissection, Cardiovascular / Pulmonary,3.0, Lobectomy & Lymph Node Dissection ,"OPERATION,1.  Right upper lung lobectomy.,2.  Mediastinal lymph node dissection.,ANESTHESIA,1.  General endotracheal anesthesia with dual-lumen tube.,2.  Thoracic epidural.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, the patient was taken to the operating room, and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered with a dual-lumen tube.  Next, the patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position, and his right chest was prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  We used a #10-blade scalpel to make an incision in the skin approximately 1 fingerbreadth below the angle of the scapula.  Dissection was carried down in a muscle-sparing fashion using Bovie electrocautery.  The 5th rib was counted, and the 6th interspace was entered.  The lung was deflated.  We identified the major fissure.  We then began by freeing up the inferior pulmonary ligament, which was done with Bovie electrocautery.  Next, we used Bovie electrocautery to dissect the pleura off the lung.  The pulmonary artery branches to the right upper lobe of the lung were identified.  Of note was the fact that there was a visible, approximately 4 x 4-cm mass in the right upper lobe of the lung without any other metastatic disease palpable.  As mentioned, a combination of Bovie electrocautery and sharp dissection was used to identify the pulmonary artery branches to the right upper lobe of the lung.  Next, we began by ligating the pulmonary artery branches of the right upper lobe of the lung.  This was done with suture ligature in combination with clips.  After taking the pulmonary artery branches of the right upper lobe of the lung, we used a combination of blunt dissection and sharp dissection with Metzenbaum scissors to separate out the pulmonary vein branch of the right upper lobe of the lung.  This likewise was ligated with a 0 silk.  It was stick-tied with a 2-0 silk.  It was then divided.  Next we dissected out the bronchial branch to the right upper lobe of the lung.  A curved Glover was placed around the bronchus.  Next a TA-30 stapler was fired across the bronchus.  The bronchus was divided with a #10-blade scalpel.  The specimen was handed off.  We next performed a mediastinal lymph node dissection.  Clips were applied to the base of the feeding vessels to the lymph nodes.  We inspected for any signs of bleeding.  There was minimal bleeding.  We placed a #32-French anterior chest tube, and a #32-French posterior chest tube.  The rib space was closed with #2 Vicryl in an interrupted figure-of-eight fashion.  A flat Jackson-Pratt drain, #10 in size, was placed in the subcutaneous flap.  The muscle layer was closed with a combination of 2-0 Vicryl followed by 2-0 Vicryl, followed by 4-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular fashion.  Sterile dressing was applied.  The instrument and sponge count was correct at the end of the case.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the PACU in good condition.","cardiovascular / pulmonary, mediastinal, thoracic, epidural, lymph node dissection, lymph node, artery branches, lobectomy, lung, anesthesia, bovie, electrocautery, lymph, pulmonary, branches"

However, the chart indicates that she had recurrent TIAs x3 yesterday, each lasting about 5 minutes with facial drooping and some mental confusion.  She had also complained of blurred vision for several days.  She was brought to the emergency room last night, where she was noted to have a left carotid bruit and was felt to have recurrent TIAs.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , The patient is on Lanoxin, amoxicillin, Hydergine, Cardizem, Lasix, Micro-K and a salt-free diet.  ,SOCIAL HISTORY: , She does not smoke or drink alcohol.,FINDINGS:  ,Admission CT scan of the head showed a densely calcified mass lesion of the sphenoid bone, probably representing the benign osteochondroma seen on previous studies.  CBC was normal, aside from a hemoglobin of 11.2.  ECG showed atrial fibrillation.  BUN was 22, creatinine normal, CPK normal, glucose normal, electrolytes normal.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , On examination, the patient is noted to be alert and fully oriented.  She has some impairment of recent memory.  She is not dysphasic, or apraxic.  Speech is normal and clear.  The head is noted to be normocephalic.  Neck is supple.

She also has atrial fibrillation, apparently chronic.  In view of her age and the fact that she is in chronic atrial fibrillation, I would suspect that she most likely has had an embolic phenomenon as the cause of her TIAs.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,  I would recommend conservative management with antiplatelet agents unless a near occlusion of the carotid arteries is demonstrated, in which case you might consider it best to do an angiography and consider endarterectomy.  In view of her age, I would be reluctant to recommend Coumadin anticoagulation.  I will be happy to follow the patient with you.","consult - history and phy., atrial fibrillation, carotid bruit, slurred speech, numbness, calcified mass lesion, neurological examination, tias, carotid, benign,"

", Consult - History and Phy.,1.0, Status Epilepticus ,"CHIEF COMPLAINT:,  Status epilepticus.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,The patient is a 6-year-old male who is a former 27-week premature infant who suffered an intraventricular hemorrhage requiring shunt placement, and as a result, has developmental delay and left hemiparesis.  At baseline, he can put about 2 to 4 words together in brief sentences.  His speech is not always easily understood; however, he is in a special education classroom in kindergarten.  He ambulates independently, but falls often.  He has difficulty with his left side compared to the right, and prefers to use the right upper extremity more than the left.  Mother reports he postures the left upper extremity when running.  He is being followed by Medical Therapy Unit and has also been seen in the past by Dr. X.  He has not received Botox or any other interventions with regard to his cerebral palsy.,The patient did require one shunt revision, but since then his shunt has done well.,The patient developed seizures about 2 years ago.  These occurred periodically, but they are always in the same and with the involvement of the left side more than right and he had an eye deviation forcefully to the left side.  His events, however, always tend to be prolonged.  He has had seizures as long as an hour and a half.  He tends to require multiple medications to stop them.  He has been followed by Dr. Y and was started on Trileptal.  At one point, The patient was taken off his medication for presumed failure to prevent his seizures.  He was more recently placed on Topamax since March 2007.  His last seizures were in March and May respectively.  He is worked up to a dose of 25 mg capsules, 2 capsules twice a day or about 5 mg/kg/day at this point.,The patient was in his usual state of health until early this morning and was noted to be in seizure.  His seizure this morning was similar to the previous seizures with forced deviation of his head and eyes to the left side and convulsion more on the left side than the right.  Family administered Diastat 7.5 mg x1 dose.  They did not know they could repeat this dose.  EMS was called and he received lorazepam 2 mg and then in the emergency department, 15 mg/kg of fosphenytoin.  His seizures stopped thereafter, since that time, he had gradually become more alert and is eating, and is nearly back to baseline.  He is a bit off balance and tends to be a bit weaker on the left side compared to baseline postictally.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , At this time, he is positive for a low-grade fever, he has had no signs of illness otherwise.  He does have some fevers after his prolonged seizures.  He denies any respiratory or cardiovascular complaints.  There is no numbness or loss of skills.  He has no rashes, arthritis or arthralgias.  He has no oropharyngeal complaints.  Visual or auditory complaints.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Also positive for some mild scoliosis.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient lives at home with mother, father, and 2 other siblings.  There are no ill contacts.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Noncontributory.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  The patient is a well-nourished, well-hydrated male, in no acute distress.,VITAL SIGNS:  His vital signs are stable and he is currently afebrile.,HEENT:  Atraumatic and normocephalic.  Oropharynx shows no lesions.,NECK:  Supple without adenopathy.,CHEST:  Clear to auscultation.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs.,ABDOMEN:  Benign without organomegaly.,EXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.,NEUROLOGIC:  The patient is alert and will follow instructions.  His speech is very dysarthric and he tends to run his words together.  He is about 50% understandable at best.  He does put words and sentences together.  His cranial nerves reveal his pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  His extraocular movements are intact.  His visual fields are full.  Disks are sharp bilaterally.  His face shows left facial weakness postictally.  His palate elevates midline.  Vision is intact bilaterally.  Tongue protrudes midline.,Motor exam reveals clearly decreased strength on the left side at baseline.  His left thigh is abducted at the hip at rest with the right thigh and leg straight.  He has difficulty using the left arm and while reaching for objects, shows exaggerated tremor/dysmetria.  Right upper extremity is much more on target.  His sensations are intact to light touch bilaterally.  Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ and symmetric.  When sitting up, he shows some truncal instability and tendency towards decreased truncal tone and kyphosis.  He also shows some scoliotic curve of the spine, which is mild at this point.  Gait was not tested today.,IMPRESSION: , This is a 6-year-old male with recurrent status epilepticus, left hemiparesis, history of prematurity, and intraventricular hemorrhage.  He is on Topamax, which is at a moderate dose of 5 mg/kg a day or 50 mg twice a day.  At this point, it is not clear whether this medication will protect him or not, but the dose is clearly not at maximum, and he is tolerating the dose currently.  The plan will be to increase him up to 50 mg in the morning, and 75 mg at night for 2 weeks, and then 75 mg twice daily.  Reviewed the possible side effects of higher doses of Topamax, they will monitor him for language issues, cognitive problems or excessive somnolence.  I also discussed his imaging studies, which showed significant destruction of the cerebellum compared to other areas and despite this, the patient at baseline has a reasonable balance.  The plan from CT standpoint is to continue stretching program, continue with medical therapy unit.  He may benefit from Botox.,In addition, I reviewed the Diastat protocol with parents and given the patient tends to go into status epilepticus each time, they can administer Diastat immediately and not wait the standard 2 minutes or even 5 minutes that they were waiting before.  They are going to repeat the dose within 10 minutes and they can call EMS at any point during that time.  Hopefully at home, they need to start to abort these seizures or the higher dose of Topamax will prevent them.  Other medication options would include Keppra, Zonegran or Lamictal.,FOLLOWUP: , Followup has already been scheduled with Dr. Y in February and they will continue to keep that date for followup.",

If in a couple of weeks her symptoms stay the same, then I would discontinue the prednisone.  I would defer that to Dr. X.  If she flares up at that point, prednisone may have to be restarted with a DMARD, so that eventually she could stay off the prednisone.  I discussed this at length with the patient and she is in full agreement with the plan.

24,141,4136," Request for consultation to evaluate stomatitis, possibly methotrexate related.", Consult - History and Phy.,1.0, Request For Consultation ,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION:, Please evaluate stomatitis, possibly methotrexate related.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:, The patient is a very pleasant 57-year old white female, a native of Cuba, being seen for evaluation and treatment of sores in her mouth that she has had for the last 10-12 days.  The patient has a long history of severe and debilitating rheumatoid arthritis for which she has had numerous treatments, but over the past ten years she has been treated with methotrexate quite successfully.  Her dosage has varied somewhere between 20 and 25 mg per week.  About the beginning of this year, her dosage was decreased from 25 mg to 20 mg, but because of the flare of the rheumatoid arthritis, it was increased to 22.5 mg per week.  She has had no problems with methotrexate as far as she knows.  She also took an NSAID about a month ago that was recently continued because of the ulcerations in her mouth.  About two weeks ago, just about the time the stomatitis began she was placed on an antibiotic for suspected upper respiratory infection.  She does not remember the name of the antibiotic.  Although she claims she remembers taking this type of medication in the past without any problems.  She was on that medication three pills a day for three to four days.  She notes no other problems with her skin.  She remembers no allergic reactions to medication.  She has no previous history of fever blisters.  ,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:, Reveals superficial erosions along the lips particularly the lower lips.  The posterior buccal mucosa along the sides of the tongue and also some superficial erosions along the upper and lower gingiva.  Her posterior pharynx was difficult to visualize, but I saw no erosions on the areas today.  There did however appear to be one small erosion on the soft palate.  Examination of the rest of her skin revealed no areas of dermatitis or blistering.  There were some macular hyperpigmentation on the right arm where she has had a previous burn, plus the deformities from her rheumatoid arthritis on her hands and feet as well as scars on her knees from total joint replacement surgeries.  ,IMPRESSION: , Erosive stomatitis probably secondary to methotrexate even though the medication has been used for ten years without any problems.  Methotrexate may produce an erosive stomatitis and enteritis after such a use. The patient also may have an enteritis that at this point may have become more quiescent as she notes that she did have some diarrhea about the time her mouth problem developed. She has had no diarrhea today, however. She has noted no blood in her stools and has had no episodes of nausea or vomiting.  ,I am not as familiar with the NSAID causing an erosive stomatitis.  I understand that it can cause gastrointestinal upset, but given the choice between the two, I would think the methotrexate is the most likely etiology for the stomatitis.  ,RECOMMENDED THERAPY: ,I agree with your therapeutic regimen regarding this condition with the use of prednisone and folic acid.  I also agree that the methotrexate must be discontinued in order to produce a resolution of this patients‚Äô skin problem. However, in my experience, this stomatitis may take a number of weeks to go away completely if a patient been on methotrexate, for an extended period of time, because the medication is stored within the liver and in fatty tissue.  Topically I have prescribed Lidex gel, which I find works extremely well in stomatitis conditions.  It can be applied t.i.d.  ,Thank you very much for allowing me to share in the care of this pleasant patient.  I will follow her with you as needed.","consult - history and phy., stomatitis, nsaid, blistering, blisters, buccal mucosa, dermatitis, erosive stomatitis, gastrointestinal, methotrexate, mouth, rheumatoid arthritis, stomatitis conditions, superficial erosions, upper respiratory infection, illness, medication"

She would usually have pustular type of lesion that would eventually break and would be quite painful.  The drainage would be malodorous.  It would initially not be infected as far as she knows, but then could eventually become infected.  She stated that this first started after she had her first born about 2 years ago.

Apparently this man was found down by a family member, was taken to Medical Center, and subsequently flown here. He has got respiratory failure, multi-organ system failure syndrome, and has renal insufficiency, as well. Markers of renal function have been fairly stable. I do not presently see indicators that he historically has been oliguric. The BUN and creatinine have been fairly stable. It is not clear whether he was taking his lisinopril up until the time of his demise, and it is also not clear whether he was taking his diuretic. Earlier thoughts had been that he could have had rhabdomyolysis, but the highest CPK I find recorded is 1500, the phosphorus is not elevated, though I acknowledge the serum calcium is low. I see no markers of myoglobinuria nor serum level of myoglobin. He has received IV fluid resuscitation, good broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, continues mechanically ventilated, and is on parenteral nutrition.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:, Not obtained from the patient, but is reviewed in other physician's notes and seems notable for probably atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease wherein he was taking Imdur and digoxin, reportedly. A suggestion of hypertensive disease versus BPH, he was on terazosin. Suggestion of CHF versus hypertension versus volume overload, treated with Lasix. He was iron, I presume for anemia. He was on potassium, lisinopril and aspirin.,ALLERGIES:, OTHER PHYSICIAN'S NOTES INDICATE NO KNOWN ALLERGIES.,FAMILY HISTORY:, Not available.,SOCIAL HISTORY:, Not available.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:, Not available.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL: An older white male who is intubated, edematous, and appears uncomfortable.,HEENT: Male pattern baldness.

I am under-whelmed presently with the diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis, if the maximum CK recorded is 1500.,4. Antecedent hypoxemia, with renal hypoperfusion.,5. Diffuse aspiration pneumonitis suggested.,DISCUSSION/PLAN: ,I think the renal function will follow the patient. Supportive care, attention to stability of a euvolemic state, will be important at this time. He is currently nonoliguric, has apparently stable, diffuse, bilateral wheezing, with adequate gas exchange. He is on TPN, antimicrobials, and has been on vasopressive agents. Blood pressures are close to acceptable, he may now be wearing off his lisinopril, assuming he was taking it prior to admission.,I would use diuretics to maintain central euvolemia.

Dr. F's assessment at that time was the patient not had sleep apnea and did not truly even seem to have allergic rhinitis.

Again, the mother gives a very confusing sleep history but it does not truly sound like the child is having apneic events that are obstructive in nature.  It sounds like he is snoring loudly and does have some nasal obstruction at nighttime.  He also is sniffing a lot through his nose.  He has been tried on some nasal steroids but they only use this on a p.r.n. basis about one or two days every month and we are unsure if that has even helped at all, probably not.

His uvula is midline.,NECK:  No lymphadenopathy appreciated.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , This is a 5-year-old male, who presents for repeat evaluation of a possible nasal obstruction, questionable sleep apnea.  Again, the mother gives a confusing sleep history but it does not really sound like he is having apneic events.  They deny any actual gasping events.  It sounds like true obstructive events.  He clearly has some symptoms at this point that would suggest possible allergic rhinitis or chronic rhinitis.  I think the most appropriate way to proceed would be to first try this child on a nasal corticosteroid and use it appropriately.  I have given them prescription for Nasacort Aqua one spray to each nostril twice a day.  I instructed them on correct way to use this and the importance to use it on a daily basis.  They may not see any benefit for several weeks.  I would like to evaluate him in six weeks to see how we are progressing.  If he continues to have problems, I think at that point we may consider performing a transnasal exam in the office to examine his adenoid bed and that would really be the only surgical option for this child.  He may also need an allergy evaluation at that point if he continues to have problems.  However, I would like to be fairly conservative in this child.  Should the mother still have concerns regarding his sleeping at our next visit or should his symptoms worsen (I did instruct her call us if it worsens), we may even need to pursue a sleep study just to settle that issue once and for all.  We will see him back in six weeks.","consult - history and phy., recurrent nasal obstruction, allergic rhinitis, apneic events, sleep apnea, nasal obstruction, nasal, apnea, allergic, obstruction, sleep, "

She notes starting in January, her husband of five years seemed to be quite withdrawn.  It turned out, he was having an affair with one of her best friends and he subsequently moved in with this woman.  The patient is distressed, as over the five years of their marriage, she has gotten herself into considerable debt supporting him and trying to find a career that would work for him.  They had moved to ABCD where he had recently been employed as a restaurant manager.  She also moved her mother and son out there and is feeling understandably upset that he was being dishonest and deceitful with her.  She has history of seasonal affective disorder, winter depressions, characterized by increased sleep, increased irritability, impatience, and fatigue.  Some suggestion on her part that her father may have had some mild bipolar disorder and including the patient has a cyclical and recurrent mood disorder.  In January, she went on citalopram.

She describes the family as being somewhat dysfunctional.  Father was a truckdriver.  She is an only child.  She reports that she had a history of anorexia and bulimia as a teenager.  In her 20s, she served six years in Naval Reserve.  She was previously married for four years.  She described that as an abusive relationship.

Overdose of citalopram and warfarin.,RECOMMENDATIONS: , The patient reports she has been feeling better since discontinuing antidepressants.  I, therefore, recommend she stay off antidepressants at present.  If needed, she can take Prozac, which has been effective for her in the past and she plans to see a psychiatrist for consultation.  She does give a fairly good history of seasonal depression and given that her mood has improved in the past with Prozac, this will be an appropriate agent to try as needed in the future, but given the situational nature of the depression, she primarily appears to need counseling.,Please feel free to contact me at digital pager if there is additional information I can provide.","consult - history and phy., citalopram, depressive disorder, overdose, warfarin, restless legs syndrome, disorder, mood"

The issues involved include the fact that for the last 10 years he has been on disability for psychiatric reasons and has been not working, and in the last several weeks to month he began to call his family talking about the fact that he had been sexually abused by brother.  He has been in outpatient therapy with Jeffrey Silverberg for the past 10 years and Mr. Silverberg became concerned about his behavior, called the family and told them to have him put in the hospital, and at one point called the police because the patient was throwing cellphones and having tantrums in his office.,The history includes the fact that the patient is the 3rd of 4 children.  A brother who is approximately 8 years older, sexually abused brother who is 4 years older.  The brother who is 8 years older lives in California and will contact the family, has had minimal contact for many years.,That brother in California is gay.

Psychiatric consultation has been requested as the patient has been noncompliant with treatment, leave the unit, does not return when requested, and it was unclear as to whether this is secondary to confusion or willful behavior.,The patient gives a significant history of behavioral problems from late adolescence until the onset of illness, states he had lot of trouble with law, he was convicted of assault, he was also arrested with small amount of cannabis, states he served one year incarcerated in ABCD that was about two years ago.  Gives an ongoing history of substance abuse until one year ago when he went into a drug rehabilitation program, he was discharged from that on 05/28/2006 and states he has been clean and sober since then.  Prior to going to rehabilitation, he was using intravenous heroin couple of times a week since age 17, which would have been over a period of about five years, reports heavy use of cannabis, smoking pot up to five times a day if he could.  He would drink up to half of a fifth of rum on a daily basis when available.,The patient is currently on Lexapro 10 mg in the morning and diazepam 10 mg at bedtime.  He complained of some depressive and some anxiety symptoms, but these do not appear to be out of proportion to his medical issues and, for this individual, the frustrations of his treatments.  He would have a limited support system here in Colorado.  He married in January and states that the marriage is not going particularly well, being young, sick, and hospitalized, has not helped his relationship with his new wife who apparently is expecting a child in July.  I would recommend some couples counseling as a part of their treatment here.,The patient was fairly drowsy during the interview and full past and developmental history was not obtained.  The patient's comment is that he grew up all over, that his parents had separated, that he lived with his mother, that he dropped out of school in eleventh grade, at that time was living in XYZ area because he did not like school.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  ,GENERAL: , This is a cooperative man, speech is soft and difficult to understand.  There is no thought disorder and no hallucination.  He denies being suicidal, but does express at times feelings about giving up on his treatments and primarily complaints about feeling that he is treated like a child and confined in the hospital.,VITAL SIGNS: , Temperature 97.2, pulse 117, respirations 16, blood pressure 127/74, oxygen saturation 97%, and weight is 154 pounds.,PSYCHIATRY:,  There is no thought disorder, no paranoia, no delusions, and no psychotic symptoms.  Activities of daily living (ADLs) appear intact.  On formal testing, he is oriented to place.  He can give a reasonable recitation of his medical history.

This patient appears to retain the ability to make decisions on his own behalf.  I think he is mentally competent.  Unfortunately, his impulsive low frustration personality dynamics do not fit well with the demands and requirements for treatment of this chronic illness.  If the patient refuses treatment, he understands that the consequences of this would likely be hastened mortality and he does state that he does not want to die.,2.  The patient does complain of depressed mood, also of anxiety.  We did discuss medications.  He appeared somewhat sedated at the time of my interview.  I would recommend that we try Seroquel 25 mg twice daily on an as-needed basis to see if this diminishes anxiety.  I will have Dr. X followup with him.,Please feel free to contact me at digital pager if additional information is needed.,My overall recommendation would be that the patient be on some random urine drug screening, that he use cell phone if he goes off the unit, to be called back up when treatments are scheduled, and hopefully he will be agreeable to complying with this.","consult - history and phy., noncompliant, confusion, graft versus host reaction, psychiatric consultation, willful behavior, cannabis, "

The patient states that she has decreased energy, suicidal ideation, suicide plan, feelings of guilt, feelings of extreme anger, psychomotor agitation, and increased appetite.  The patient states her sleep is normal and her ability to concentrate is normal.  The patient states that last night she had an argument with her husband in which he threaten to divorce her.  The patient went into the rest room, tried to find a razor blade, could not find one but instead found a scissor and cut her arm moderately with some moderate depth.  She felt better after doing so and put a bandage over the wound and did not report to her husband or anybody else what she had done.  The patient reports that she has had increased tension with her husband as of recent.  She notes that approximately a week ago she struck her husband several times.  She states that he has never hit her but instead pushed her back after she was hitting him.  She reports no history of abuse in the past.  The patient identifies recent stressors as having ongoing conflict at work with her administrator with them ""cracking down on me."" The patient also notes that her longstanding therapy will be temporarily interrupted by the therapist having a child.  She states that her recent depression seems to coincide with her growing knowledge that her therapist was pregnant.  The patient states that she has a tremendous amount of anger towards her therapist for discontinuing or postponing treatment.  She states that she feels ""abandoned."" The patient notes that it does raise issues with her past, where she had a child at the age of 17 who she gave away for adoption and a second child that she was pregnant by the age of 42 that she aborted at the request of her husband.  The patient states she saw her therapist most recently last Friday.  She sees the therapy weekly and indicates the therapy helps, although she is unable to specify how.  When asked for specifics of what she has learned from the therapy, the patient was unable to reply.  It appears that she is very concrete and has difficulty with symbolization and abstractions and self-observation.  The patient reports that at her last visit her therapist was concerned that she may be suicidal and was considering hospitalization.  The patient, at that point, stated that she would be safe through Monday despite having made a gesture last night.

The patient reports her current sleep is about eight hours per night.  She states that longest she has been able to stay awake in the past has been 24 hours.  She states that during periods where she feels up she sleeps perhaps six hours per night.  The patient reports no spending sprees and no reports no sexual indiscretions.  The patient states that her sexuality does increase when she is feeling better but not enormously so.  The patient denies any history of delusions or hallucinations.  The patient denies any psychosis.  The patient states that she does have mood swings and that the upstate lasts for a couple of weeks at longest.  She states that more predominately she has depression.  The patient states that she does not engage in numerous projects when she is in an upstate although does imagine doing so.  The patient notes that suicidality and depression seems to often arise around disputes with her husband and/or feelings of abandonment.  The patient indicates some satisfaction when she is called on her behavior ""I need to answer for my actions."" The patient gives a substantial history of alcohol abuse lasting up to about five years ago when she was hospitalized.  Most typically, the patient will drink at least a bottle of wine per day.  The patient has attended AA but at present going once a week, although she states that she is not engaged as she has been in the past; and when asked if she may be in early relapse, she indicates that yes that is a very real possibility.

The patient also states that she feels abandoned with the upcoming discontinuation of treatment while the therapist is giving birth and thereafter.  Symptoms are consistent with a longstanding dysthymia and reoccurring depression.

We would recommend continued weekly or twice weekly insight oriented psychotherapy with aggressive exploration of the patient's reaction to her therapist's departure.  We would also recommend dialectical behavioral therapy while the therapist is on leave.  We would recommend continued treatment with SSRIs for dysthymia and depression.  We would suggest prescribing long acting antidepressant such as Prozac, given the patient's ambivalence regarding medications.  Prozac should be pushed to minimum of 40 mg, which the patient has already tolerated in the past, but most likely up to 60 or 80 mg.  We might also supplement the Prozac with a (anti-sleep medication).,Time spent with the patient was 1.5 hours.",

I would like to increase the database regarding the details of his historical diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder before pursuing referrals for outpatient mental health care.  The internal medicine service will evaluate for treatment for any underlying medical problems specifically to provide recommendations regarding pain management.",

52,192,4209, A 17-year-old male with oligoarticular arthritis of his right knee., Consult - History and Phy.,3.0, Oligoarticular Arthritis - 1 ,"HISTORY:,  A is here for a follow up appointment at our Pediatric Rheumatology Clinic as well as the CCS Clinic.  A is a 17-year-old male with oligoarticular arthritis of his right knee.  He had a joint injection back in 03/2007 and since then he has been doing relatively well.  He is taking Indocin only as needed even though he said he has pain regularly, and he said that his knee has not changed since the beginning, but he said he only takes the medicine when he has pain, which is not every day, but almost every day.  He denies any swelling more than what it was before, and he denies any other joints are affected at this moment.  Denies any fevers or any rashes.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,  On physical examination, his temperature is 98.6, weight is 104.6 kg; which is 4.4 kg less than before, 108/70 is his blood pressure, weight is 91.0 kg, and his pulse is 80.  He is alert, active, and oriented in no distress.  He has no facial rashes, no lymphadenopathy, no alopecia.  Funduscopic examination is within normal limit.  He has no cataracts and symmetric pupils to light and accommodation.  His chest is clear to auscultation.  The heart has a regular rhythm with no murmur.  The abdomen is soft and nontender with no :  visceromegaly.  Musculoskeletal examination showed good range of motion of all his upper extremities with no swelling or tenderness.  Lower extremities:  He still has some weakness of the knees, hip areas, and the calf muscles.  He does have minus/plus swelling of the right knee with a very hypermobile patella.  There is no limitation in his range of motion, and the swelling is very minimal with some mild tenderness.,In terms of his laboratories, they were not done today.,ASSESSMENT: , This is a 17-year-old male with oligoarticular arthritis.  He is HLA-B27 negative.,PLAN:,  In terms of the plan, I discussed with him what things he should be taking and the fact that since he has persistent symptoms, he should be on medication every day.  I am going to switch him to Indocin 75 mg SR just to give more sustained effect to his joints, and if he does not respond to this or continue with the symptoms, we may need to get an MRI.  We will see him back in three months.  He was evaluated by our physical therapist, who gave him some recommendations in terms of exercise for his lower extremities.  Future plans for A may include physical therapy and more stronger medications as well as imaging studies with an MRI.  Today he received his flu shot.  Discussed this with A and his aunt and they had no further questions.","consult - history and phy., rheumatology, rheumatology clinic, lower extremities, oligoarticular arthritis, arthritis, oligoarticular, knee, swelling,"

BIMANUAL: Reveals significant cervical motion tenderness and fundal tenderness.  She had no tenderness in her adnexa.  There are no palpable masses.,A:,  Although unlikely based on the patient's exam and pain, I have to consider subclinical pelvic inflammatory disease.  GC and chlamydia was sent and I treated her prophylactically with Rocephin 250 mg and azithromycin 1000 mg.  Repeat biopsies were not performed based on her colposcopy as well as her previous Pap and colposcopy by Dr. A.  A LEEP is a reasonable approach even in this 16-year-old.,P:,  We will schedule LEEP in the near future.  Even though she has already been exposed HPV Gardasil would still be beneficial in this patient to help prevent recurrence of low-grade lesions as well as high-grade lesions.

She is complaining of a three-month history of lower abdominal pain for which she has been to the emergency room twice.  She describes the pain as bilateral, intermittent, and non-radiating.  It decreases slightly when she eats and increases with activity.  She states the pain when it comes can last for half-a-day.  It is not associated with movement, but occasionally the pain was so bad that it was associated with vomiting.  She has tried LactAid, which initially helped, but then the pain returned.  She has tried changing her diet and Pepcid AC.  She was seen at XYZ where blood work was done.  At that time, she had a normal white count and a normal H&H.  She was given muscle relaxants, which did not work.,Approximately two weeks ago, she was seen in the emergency room at XYZ where a pelvic ultrasound was done.  This showed a 1.9 x 1.4-cm cyst on the right with no free fluid.  The left ovary and uterus appeared normal.  Two days later, the pain resolved and she has not had a recurrence.  She denies constipation and diarrhea.  She has had some hot flashes, but has not taken her temperature.,In addition, she states that her periods have been very irregular coming between four and six weeks.  They are associated with cramping which she is not happy about.,She has never had a pelvic exam.  She states she is not sexually active and declined having her mother leave the room, so she was not questioned regarding this without her mother present.  She is very interested in not having pain with her periods and if this was a cyst that caused her pain, she is interested in starting birth control pills to prevent this from happening again.,PAST MEDICAL HX:  ,Pneumonia in 2002, depression diagnosed in 2005, and seizures as an infant.,PAST SURGICAL HX:  ,Plastic surgery on her ear after a dog bite in 1997.,MEDICATIONS:  ,Zoloft 50 mg a day and LactAid.,ALLERGIES:  ,NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.,SOCIAL HX: , She enjoys cooking and scrapbooking.

HEART: Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs.  ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, and nondistended.  There is no organomegaly or lymphadenopathy.  PELVIC: Deferred.,A/P: , Abdominal pain, unclear etiology.  I expressed my doubt that her pain was secondary to this 1.9-cm ovarian cyst given the fact that there was no free fluid surrounding this.  However, given that she has irregular periods and they are painful for her, I think it is reasonable to start her on a low-dose birth control pill.  She has no personal or familial contraindications to start this.  She was given a prescription for Lo/Ovral, dispensed 30 with refill x 4.  She will come back in six weeks for blood pressure check as well as in six months to followup on her pain and her bleeding patterns.,If she should have the recurrence of her pain, I have advised her to call.","consult - history and phy., irregular periods, lactaid, abdominal pain, birth control pills, cyst, ovarian cyst, ovaries, ovary, pelvic exam, sexually active, uterus, lymphadenopathy, pelvic, irregular, periods"

Although this has been a very successful treatment in terms of her febrile seizure control, she is now having occasional brief periods of pauses and staring, where she becomes unresponsive, but does not lose her postural tone.  The typical spell according to dad last anywhere from 10 to 15 seconds, mom says 3 to 4 minutes, which likely means probably somewhere in the 30- to 40-second period of time.  Mom did note that an episode had happened outside of a store recently, was associated with some perioral cyanosis, but there has never been a convulsive activity noted.  There have been no recent changes in her Keppra dosing and she is currently only at 20 mg/kg per day, which is overall a low dose for her.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Born at 36 weeks' gestation by C-section delivery at 8 pounds 3 ounces.

For now, we will go ahead and try to capture EEG as long as she tolerates it; however, if she would require sedation, I would defer the EEG until further adjustments to seizure medications are made and we will see her response to these medications.,2.  As per the above, I will increase her Keppra to 300 mg p.o. b.i.d. bringing her to a total daily dose of just under 40 mg/kg per day.  If further spells are noted, we may increase upwards again to around 4.5 to 5 mL each day.,3.  I do not feel like any specific imaging needs to be done at this time until we see her response to the medication and review her EEG findings.  EEG, hopefully, will be able to be reviewed first thing tomorrow morning; however, I would not delay discharge the patient to wait on the EEG results.  The patient has been discharged and we will contact the family as an outpatient.,4.

A summary of pertinent information is presented below.  Please refer to the patient's medical chart for a more complete history.,HISTORY OF PRESENTING PROBLEM: , The patient was brought to the Hospital Emergency Department on 09/30/09 after experiencing an episode of confusion for which he has no recall the previous day.  He has no recollection of the event.  The following information is obtained from his medical record.  On 09/29/09, he reportedly went to a five-hour meeting and stated several times ""I do not feel well"" and looked ""glazed.""  He does not remember anything from midmorning until the middle of the night and when his wife came home, she found him in bed at 6 p.m., which is reportedly unusual.  She thought he was warm and had chills.  He later returned to his baseline.  He was seen by Dr. X in the hospital on 09/30/09 and reported to him at that time that he felt that he had returned entirely to baseline.  His neurological exam at that time was unremarkable aside from missing one of three items on recall for the Mini-Mental Status Examination.  Due to mild memory complaints from himself and his wife, he was referred for more extensive neuropsychological testing.  Note that reportedly when his wife found him in bed, he was shaking and feeling nauseated, somewhat clammy and kept saying that he could not remember anything and he was repeating himself, asking the same questions in an agitated way, so she brought him to the emergency room.  The patient had an episode two years ago of transient loss of memory during which he was staring blankly while sitting at his desk at work and the episode lasted approximately two hours.  He was hospitalized at Hospital at that time as well and evaluation included negative EEG, MRI showing mild atrophy, and a neurological consultation, which did not result in a specific diagnosis, but during this episode he was also reportedly nauseous.  He was also reportedly amnestic for this episode.,In 2004, he had a sense of a funny feeling in his neck and electrodes in his head and had an MRI at that time which showed some small vessel changes.,During this interview, the patient reported that other than a coworker noticing a few careless errors in his completion of some documents and his wife reporting some mild memory changes that he had not noticed any significant decline.

She was referred to Dr. X for diagnostic differentiation for possible seizures or other causes of syncope.  The patient reports an extensive neurological history.  Her mother used alcohol during her pregnancy with the patient.  In spite of exposure to alcohol in utero, the patient reported that she achieved ""honors in school"" and ""looked smart.""  She reported that she began to experience migraines at 11 years of age.  At 15 years of age, she reported that she was thought to have hydrocephalus.  She reported that she will frequently ""bang her head against the wall"" to relieve the pain.  The patient gave birth to her daughter at 17 years of age.

The patient reported that she could recall before being hit, but could not recall the activities of that same day or the following day.  She reported that she had difficulty walking following this head injury, but received rehabilitation for approximately one month.  Her migraines became more severe following the head injury.  In 1998, she reportedly was experiencing episodes of syncope where she would experience a headache with photophobia, phonophobia, and flashing lights.  Following the syncope episode, she would experience some confusion.  These episodes reportedly were related to her donating plasma.,The patient also reported that her ex-husband stated that she frequently jerked and would shake in her sleep.

A second episode occurred on July 20th when she lost consciousness for may be a full day.  She was admitted to Sinai Hospital and assessed by a neurologist.  Her EEG and head CT were considered to be completely normal.  She did not report any typical episodes during the time of her 36-hour EEG.  She reported that her last episode of syncope occurred prior to her being hospitalized.  She stated that she had an aura of her ears ringing, vision being darker and ""tunnel vision"" (vision goes smaller to a pinpoint), and she was ""spazzing out"" on the floor.

84,225,4256, The patient is a 58-year-old African-American right-handed female with 16 years of education who was referred for a neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. X.  A comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning., Consult - History and Phy.,3.0, Neuropsychological Evaluation - 4 ,"REASON FOR REFERRAL:,  The patient is a 58-year-old African-American right-handed female with 16 years of education who was referred for a neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. X. She is presenting for a second opinion following a recent neuropsychological evaluation that was ordered by her former place of employment that suggested that she was in the ""early stages of a likely dementia"" and was thereafter terminated from her position as a psychiatric nurse.  A comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning.  Note that this evaluation was undertaken as a clinical exam and intended for the purposes of aiding with treatment planning.  The patient was fully informed about the nature of this evaluation and intended use of the results.,RELEVANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  ,Historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and clinical interview with the patient.  A summary of pertinent information is presented below.  Please refer to the patient's medical chart for a more complete history.,HISTORY OF PRESENTING PROBLEM:,  The patient reported that she had worked as a nurse supervisor for Hospital Center for four years.  She was dismissed from this position in September 2009, although she said that she is still under active status technically, but is not able to work.  She continues to receive some compensation through FMLA hours.  She said that she was told that she had three options, to resign, to apply for disability retirement, and she had 90 days to complete the process of disability retirement after which her employers would file for charges in order for her to be dismissed from State Services.  She said that these 90 days are up around the end of November.  She said the reason for her dismissal was performance complaints.  She said that they began ""as soon as she arrived and that these were initially related to problems with her taking too much sick time off secondary to diabetes and fibromyalgia management and at one point she needed to obtain a doctor's note for any days off.  She said that her paperwork was often late and that she received discipline for not disciplining her staff frequently enough for tardiness or missed workdays.  She described it as a very chaotic and hectic work environment in which she was often putting in extra time.  She said that since September 2008 she only took two sick days and was never late to work, but that she continued to receive a lot of negative feedback.,In July of this year, she reportedly received a letter from personnel indicating that she was being referred to a state medical doctor because she was unable to perform her job duties and due to excessive sick time.  Following a brief evaluation with this doctor whose records we do not have, she was sent to a neuropsychologist, Dr. Y, Ph.D.  He completed a Comprehensive Independent Medical Evaluation on 08/14/2009.  She said that on 08/27/2009, she returned to see the original doctor who told her that based on that evaluation she was not able to work anymore.  Please note that we do not have copies of any of her work-related correspondence.  The patient never received a copy of the neuropsychological evaluation because she was told that it was ""too derogatory.""  A copy of that evaluation was provided directly to this examiner for the purpose of this evaluation.  To summarize, the results indicated ""diagnostically, The patient presents cognitive deficits involving visual working memory, executive functioning, and motor functioning along with low average intellectual functioning that is significantly below her memory functioning and below expectation based on her occupational and academic history.  This suggests that her intellectual functioning has declined.""  It concluded that ""results overall suggest early stages of a likely dementia or possibly the effects of diabetes, although her deficits are greater than expected for diabetes-related executive functioning problems and peripheral neuropathy‚Ä¶  The patient' deficits within the current test battery suggest that she would not be able to safely and effectively perform the duties of a nurse supervisor without help handling documentary demands and some supervision of her visual processing.  The prognosis for improvement is not good, although she might try stimulant medication if compatible with her other.  Following her dismissal, The patient presented to her primary physician, Henry Fein, M.D., who referred her to Dr. X for a second opinion regarding her cognitive deficits.  His neurological examination on 09/23/2009 was unremarkable.  The patient scored 20/30 on the Mini-Mental Status Exam missing one out of three words on recall, but was able to do so with prompting.  A repeat neurocognitive testing was suggested in order to assess for subtle deficits in memory and concentration that were not appreciated on this gross cognitive measure.,IMAGING STUDIES: , MRI of the brain on 09/14/2009 was unremarkable with no evidence of acute intracranial abnormality or abnormal enhancing lesions.  Note that the MRI was done with and without gadolinium contrast.,CURRENT FUNCTIONING:  ,The patient reported that she had experienced some difficulty completing paperwork on time due primarily to the chaoticness of the work environment and the excessive amount of responsibility that was placed upon her.  When asked about changes in cognitive functioning, she denied noticing any decline in problem solving, language, or nonverbal skills.  She also denied any problems with attention and concentration or forgetfulness or memory problems.  She continues to independently perform all activities of daily living.  She is in charge of the household finances, has had no problems paying bills on time, has had no difficulties with driving or accidents, denied any missed appointments and said that no one has provided feedback to her that they have noticed any changes in her cognitive functioning.  She reported that if her children had noticed anything they definitely would have brought it to her attention.  She said that she does not currently have a lawyer and does not intend to return to her previous physician.  She said she has not yet proceeded with the application for disability retirement because she was told that her doctors would have to fill out that paperwork, but they have not claimed that she is disabled and so she is waiting for the doctors at her former workplace to initiate the application.  Other current symptoms include excessive fatigue.  She reported that she was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome in 1991, but generally symptoms are under better control now, but she still has difficulty secondary to fibromyalgia.  She also reported having fallen approximately five times within the past year.  She said that this typically occurs when she is climbing up steps and is usually related to her right foot ""like dragging.""  Dr. X's physical examination revealed no appreciable focal peripheral deficits on motor or sensory testing and notes that perhaps these falls are associated with some stiffness and pain of her right hip and knee, which are chronic symptoms from her fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis.  She said that she occasionally bumps into objects, but denied noticing it happening one on any particular part of her body.  Muscle pain secondary to fibromyalgia reportedly occurs in her neck and shoulders down both arms and in her left hip.,OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY: , The patient reported that her birth and development were normal.  She denied any significant medical conditions during childhood.  As mentioned, she now has a history of fibromyalgia.  She also experiences some restriction in the range of motion with her right arm.  MRI of the C-spine 04/02/2009 showed a hemangioma versus degenerative changes at C7 vertebral body and bulging annulus with small central disc protrusion at C6-C7.  MRI of the right shoulder on 06/04/2009 showed small partial tear of the distal infraspinatus tendon and prominent tendinopathy of the distal supraspinatus tendon.  As mentioned, she was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome in 1991.  She thought that this may actually represent early symptoms of fibromyalgia and said that symptoms are currently under control.  She also has diabetes, high blood pressure, osteoarthritis, tension headaches, GERD, carpal tunnel disease, cholecystectomy in 1976, and ectopic pregnancy in 1974.  Her previous neuropsychological evaluation referred to an outpatient left neck cystectomy in 2007.  She has some difficulty falling asleep, but currently typically obtains approximately seven to eight hours of sleep per night.  She did report some sleep disruption secondary to unusual dreams and thought that she talked to herself and could sometimes hear herself talking in her sleep.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  NovoLog, insulin pump, metformin, metoprolol, amlodipine, Topamax, Lortab, tramadol, amitriptyline, calcium plus vitamin D, fluoxetine, pantoprazole, Naprosyn, fluticasone propionate, and vitamin C.,SUBSTANCE USE: , The patient reported that she rarely drinks alcohol and she denied smoking or using illicit drugs.  She drinks two to four cups of coffee per day.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,The patient was born and raised in North Carolina.  She was the sixth of nine siblings.  Her father was a chef.  He completed third grade and died at 60 due to complications of diabetes.  Her mother is 93 years old.  Her last job was as a janitor.  She completed fourth grade.  She reported that she has no cognitive problems at this time.  Family medical history is significant for diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, thyroid problems, sarcoidosis, and possible multiple sclerosis and depression.  The patient completed a Bachelor of Science in Nursing through State University in 1979.  She denied any history of problems in school such as learning disabilities, attentional problems, difficulty learning to read, failed grades, special help in school or behavioral problems.  She was married for two years.  Her ex-husband died in 1980 from acute pancreatitis secondary to alcohol abuse.  She has two children ages 43 and 30.  Her son whose age is 30 lives nearby and is in consistent contact with her and she is also in frequent contact and has a close relationship with her daughter who lives in New York.  In school, the patient reported obtaining primarily A's and B's.  She said that her strongest subject was math while her worst was spelling, although she reported that her grades were still quite good in spelling.  The patient worked for Hospital Center for four years.  Prior to that, she worked for an outpatient mental health center for 2-1/2 years.  She was reportedly either terminated or laid off and was unsure of the reason for that.  Prior to that, she worked for Walter P. Carter Center reportedly for 21 years.  She has also worked as an OB nurse in the past.  She reported that other than the two instances reported above, she had never been terminated or fired from a job.  In her spare time, the patient enjoys reading, participating in women's groups doing puzzles, playing computer games.,PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: , The patient reported that she sought psychotherapy on and off between 1991 and 1997 secondary to her chronic fatigue.  She was also taking Prozac during that time.  She then began taking Prozac again when she started working at secondary to stress with the work situation.  She reported a chronic history of mild sadness or depression, which was relatively stable.  When asked about her current psychological experience, she said that she was somewhat sad, but not dwelling on things.  She denied any history of suicidal ideation or homicidal ideation.,TASKS ADMINISTERED:,Clinical Interview,Adult History Questionnaire,Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR),Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE),Cognistat Neurobehavioral Cognitive Status Examination,Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS; Form XX),Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, 2nd Edition (DRS-2),Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (NAB),Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Third Edition (WAIS-III),Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV),Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI),Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA),Auditory Consonant Trigrams (ACT),Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT),Ruff 2 & 7 Selective Attention Test,Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT),Multilingual Aphasia Examination, Second Edition (MAE-II), Token Test, Sentence Repetition, Visual Naming, Controlled Oral Word Association, Spelling Test, Aural Comprehension, Reading Comprehension,Boston Naming Test, Second Edition (BNT-2),Animal Naming Test",

86,227,4258, Neurologic consultation was requested to assess and assist with seizure medication., Consult - History and Phy.,3.0, Neurologic Consultation - 3 ,"HISTORY: , Neurologic consultation was requested to assess and assist with her seizure medication.  The patient is a 3-year 3 months old girl with refractory epilepsy.  She had been previously followed by XYZ, but has been under the care of the UCSF epilepsy program and recently by Dr. Y.  I reviewed her pertinent previous neurology evaluations at CHCC and also interviewed mom.,The patient had seizure breakthrough in August 2007, which requires inpatient admission, Thanksgiving and then after that time had seizures every other day, up-to-date early December.  She remained seizure-free until 12/25/2007 when she had a breakthrough seizure at home treated with Diastat.  She presented to our ER today with prolonged convulsive seizure despite receiving 20 mg of Diastat at home.  Mom documented 103 temperature at home.  In the ER, this was 101 to 102 degrees Fahrenheit.  I reviewed the ER notes.  At 0754 hours, she was having intermittent generalized tonic-clonic seizures despite receiving a total of 1.5 mg of lorazepam x5.  UCSF fellow was contacted.  She was given additional fosphenytoin and had a total dose of 15 mg/kg administered.  Vital weight was 27.  Seizures apparently had stopped.  The valproic acid level obtained at 0835 hours was 79.  According to mom, her last dose was at 6 p.m. and she did not receive her morning dose.  Other labs slightly showed leukocytosis with white blood cell count 21,000 and normal CMP.,Previous workup here showed an EEG on 2005, which showed a left posterior focus.  MRI on June 2007 and January 2005 were within normal limits.  Mom describes the following seizure types:,1.  Eye blinking with unresponsiveness.,2.  Staring off to one side.,3.  Focal motor activity in one arm and recently generalized tonic seizure.,She also said that she was supposed to see Dr. Y this Friday, but had postponed it to some subsequent time when results of genetic testing would be available.  She was being to physicians' care as Dr. Z had previously being following her last UCSF.,She had failed most of the first and second line anti-epileptic drugs.  These include Keppra, Lamictal, Trileptal, phenytoin and phenobarbital.  These are elicited to allergies, but she has not had any true allergic reactions to these.  Actually, it has resulted in an allergic reaction resulting in rash and hypotension.,She also had been treated with Clobazam.  Her best control is with her current regimen of valproic acid and Tranxene.  Other attempts to taper Topamax, but this resulted increased seizures.  She also has oligohidrosis during this summertime.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Include Diastat 20 mg; Topamax 25 mg b.i.d., which is 3.3 per kilo per day; Tranxene 15 mg b.i.d.; Depakote 125 mg t.i.d., which is 25 per kilo per day.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS:  Weight 15 kg.,GENERAL:  The patient was awake, she appeared sedated and postictal.,NECK:  Supple.,NEUROLOGICAL:  She had a few brief myoclonic jerks of her legs during drowsiness, but otherwise no overt seizure, no seizure activity nor involuntary movements were observed.,She was able to follow commands such as when I request that she gave mom a kiss.  She acknowledged her doll.  Left fundus is sharp.  She resisted the rest of the exam.  There was no obvious lateralized findings.,ASSESSMENT:,  Status epilepticus resolved.  Triggered by a febrile illness, possibly viral.  Refractory remote symptomatic partial epilepsy.,IMPRESSION: , I discussed the maximizing Depakote to mom and she concurred.  I recommend increasing her maintenance dose to one in the morning, one in the day, and two at bedtime.  For today, she did give an IV Depacon 250 mg and the above dosage can be continued IV until she is taking p.o.  Dr. X agreed with the changes and orders were written for this.  She can continue her current doses of Topamax and Tranxene.  This can be given by NG if needed.  Topamax can be potentially increased to 25 mg in the morning and 50 mg at night.  I will be available as needed during the rest of her hospitalization.

87,228,4259," Patient has trouble with walking and balance, with bladder control, and with thinking and memory.", Consult - History and Phy.,3.0, Neurologic Consultation - 2 ,"REASON FOR VISIT:  ,The patient is a 76-year-old man referred for neurological consultation by Dr. X.  The patient is companied to clinic today by his wife and daughter.  He provides a small portion of his history; however, his family provides virtually all of it.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , He has trouble with walking and balance, with bladder control, and with thinking and memory.  When I asked him to provide me detail, he could not tell me much more than the fact that he has trouble with his walking and that he has trouble with his bladder.  He is vaguely aware that he has trouble with his memory.,According to his family, he has had difficulty with his gait for at least three or four years.  At first, they thought it was weakness and because of he was on the ground (for example, gardening) he was not able to get up by himself.  They did try stopping the statin that he was taking at that time, but because there was no improvement over two weeks, they resumed the statin.  As time progressed, he developed more and more difficulty.  He started to shuffle.  He started using a cane about two and a half years ago and has used a walker with wheels in the front since July of 2006.  At this point, he frequently if not always has trouble getting in or out of the seat.  He frequently tends to lean backwards or sideways when sitting.  He frequently if not always has trouble getting in or out a car, always shuffles or scuffs his feet, always has trouble turning or changing direction, always has trouble with uneven surfaces or curbs, and always has to hold on to someone or something when walking.  He has not fallen in the last month.  He did fall earlier, but there seemed to be fewer opportunities for him to fall.  His family has recently purchased a lightweight wheelchair to use if he is traveling long distances.  He has no stairs in his home, however, his family indicates that he would not be able to take stairs.  His handwriting has become smaller and shakier.,In regard to the bladder, he states, ""I wet the bed.""  In talking with his family, it seems as if he has no warning that he needs to empty his bladder.  He was diagnosed with a small bladder tumor in 2005.  This was treated by Dr. Y.  Dr. X does not think that the bladder tumor has anything to do with the patient's urinary incontinence.  The patient has worn a pad or undergarment for at least one to one and a half years.  His wife states that they go through two or three of them per day.  He has been placed on medications; however, they have not helped.,He has no headaches or sensation of head fullness.,In regard to the thinking and memory, at first he seemed forgetful and had trouble with dates.  Now he seems less spontaneous and his family states he seems to have trouble expressing himself.  His wife took over his medications about two years ago.  She stopped his driving about three years ago.  She discovered that his license had been expired for about a year and she was concerned enough at that time that she told him he could drive no more.  Apparently, he did not object.  At this point, he frequently has trouble with memory, orientation, and everyday problems solving at home.  He needs coaching for his daily activities such as reminders to brush his teeth, put on his clothes, and so forth.  He is a retired office machine repairman.  He is currently up and active about 12 hours a day and sleeping or lying down about 12 hours per day.,He has not had PT or OT and has not been treated with medications for Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease.  He has been treated for the bladder.  He has not had lumbar puncture.,Past medical history and review of all 14 systems from the form they completed for this visit that I reviewed with them is negative with the exception that he has had hypertension since 1985, hypercholesterolemia since 1997, and diabetes since 1998.  The bladder tumor was discovered in 2005 and was treated noninvasively.  He has lost weight from about 200 pounds to 180 pounds over the last two or three years.  He had a period of depression in 1999 and was on Prozac for a while, but this was then stopped.  He used to drink a significant amount of alcohol.  This was problematic enough that his wife was concerned.  She states he stopped when she retired and she was at home all day.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,He quit smoking in 1968.  His current weight is 183 pounds.  His tallest height is 5 feet 10 inches.,FAMILY HISTORY:  ,His grandfather had arthritis.  His father had Parkinson's disease.  His mother had heart disease and a sister has diabetes.,He does not have a Living Will and indicates he would wish his wife to make decisions for him if he could not make them for himself.,REVIEW OF HYDROCEPHALUS RISK FACTORS: , None.,ALLERGIES: , None.,MEDICATIONS: , Metformin 500 mg three times a day, Lipitor 10 mg per day, lisinopril 20 mg per day, metoprolol 50 mg per day, Uroxatral 10 mg per day, Detrol LA 4 mg per day, and aspirin 81 mg per day.,PHYSICAL EXAM: , On examination today, this is a pleasant 76-year-old man who is guided back from the clinic waiting area walking with his walker.  He is well developed, well nourished, and kempt.,Vital Signs:  His weight is 180 pounds.,Head:  The head is normocephalic and atraumatic.  The head circumference is 59 cm, which is the ,75-90th percentile for an adult man whose height is 178 cm.,Spine:  The spine is straight and not tender.  I can easily palpate the spinous processes.  There is no scoliosis.,Skin:  No neurocutaneous stigmata.,Cardiovascular Examination:  No carotid or vertebral bruits.,Mental Status:  Assessed for orientation, recent and remote memory, attention span, concentration, language, and fund of knowledge.  The Mini-Mental State Exam score was 17/30.  He did not know the year, season, or day of the week nor did he know the building or specialty or the floor.  There was a tendency for perseveration during the evaluation.  He could not copy the diagram of intersecting pentagons.,Cranial Nerve Exam:  No evidence of papilledema.  The pupillary light reflex is intact as are extraocular movements without nystagmus, facial expression and sensation, hearing, head turning, tongue, and palate movement.,Motor Exam:  Normal bulk and strength, but the tone is marked by significant paratonia.  There is no atrophy, fasciculations, or drift.  There is tremulousness of the outstretched hands.,Sensory Exam:  Is difficult to interpret.  Either he does not understand the test or he is mostly guessing.,Cerebellar Exam:  Is intact for finger-to-nose, heel-to-knee, and rapid alternating movement tests.  There is no dysarthria.,Reflexes:  Trace in the arms, 2+ at the knees, and 0 at the ankles.  It is not certain whether there is a Babinski sign or simply withdrawal.,Gait:  Assessed using the Tinetti assessment tool that shows a balance score of 7-10/16 and a gait score of 2-5/12 for a total score of 9-15/28, which is significantly impaired.,REVIEW OF X-RAYS: , I personally reviewed the MRI scan of the brain from December 11, 2007 at Advanced Radiology.  It shows the ventricles are enlarged with a frontal horn span of 5.0 cm.  The 3rd ventricle contour is flat.  The span is enlarged at 12 mm.  The sylvian aqueduct is patent.  There is a pulsation artifact.  The corpus callosum is effaced.  There are extensive T2 signal abnormalities that are confluent in the corona radiata.  There are also scattered T2 abnormalities in the basal ganglia.  There is a suggestion of hippocampal atrophy.  There is also a suggestion of vermian atrophy.,ASSESSMENT: , The patient has a clinical syndrome that raises the question of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus.  His examination today is notable for moderate-to-severe dementia and moderate-to-severe gait impairment.  His MRI scan raises the question of hydrocephalus, however, is also consistent with cerebral small vessel disease.,PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES:,1.  Possible idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (331.5).,2.  Probable cerebral small-vessel disease (290.40 & 438).,3.  Gait impairment (781.2).,4.  Urinary urgency and incontinence (788.33).,5.

90,231,4263, The patient is a 55-year-old gentleman who presents for further evaluation of right leg weakness., Consult - History and Phy.,3.0, Neuro Consult - Leg Weakness ,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 55-year-old gentleman who presents for further evaluation of right leg weakness.  He has difficulty recollecting the exact details and chronology of his problem.  To the best of his recollection, he thinks that about six months ago he developed weakness of his right leg.  He describes that he is reaching to get something from a cabinet and he noticed that he was unable to stand on his right toe.  Since that time, he has had difficulty pushing off when he walks.  He has mild tingling and numbness in his toes, but this has been a chronic problem and nothing new since he has developed the weakness.  He has chronic mild back pain, but this has been persistent for many years and has not changed.  He has experienced cramps in both calves for the past year.  This dissipated about two months ago.  He does not think that his left leg is weak.  He does not have any bowel or bladder incontinence.  There is no radicular pain.  He does not think that the problem is progressive, meaning that the weakness that he perceives in his right leg is no different than when it was six months ago.,He first sought medical attention for this problem in October.  He then saw you a couple of months later.  He has undergone an EMG and nerve conduction studies.  Unfortunately, he cannot undergo an MRI of his spine because he has an ear implant.  He has had a CT scan that shows degenerative changes, but nothing obviously abnormal.,In addition, the patient has hyperCKemia.  He tells me that he has had an elevated CK prior to starting taking stat medications, although this is not entirely clear to me.  He thinks that he is not taking Lipitor for about 15 months and thought that his CK was in the 500 or 600s prior to starting it.  Once it was started, it increased to about 800 and then came down to about 500 when it was stopped.  He then had a recent bump again up to the 1000 and since Lipitor has been stopped, his CK apparently has returned to about the 500 or 600s.  I do no have any laboratory data to support these statements by the patient, but he seems to be up to speed on this.  More recently, he has been started taking Zetia.  He does not have any proximal weakness.  He denies any myalgias., ,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  He has coronary artery disease and has received five stents.  He has hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.  He states that he was diagnosed with diabetes based on the results of an abnormal oral glucose tolerance test.  He believes that his glucose shot up to over 300 with this testing.  He does not take any medications for this and his blood glucoses are generally normal when he checks it.  He has had plastic surgery on his face from an orbital injury.  He also had an ear graft when he developed an ear infection during his honeymoon., ,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:, He takes amlodipine, Diovan, Zetia, hydrochlorothiazide, Lovaza (fish oil), Niaspan, aspirin, and Chantix.  , ,ALLERGIES:,  He has no known drug allergies., ,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  He lives with his wife.  He works at Shepherd Pratt doing network engineering.  He smokes a pack of cigarettes a day and is working on quitting.  He drinks four alcoholic beverages per night.  Prior to that, he drank significantly more.  He denies illicit drug use.  He was athletic growing up., ,FAMILY HISTORY:,  His mother died of complications from heart disease.  His father died of heart disease in his 40s.  He has two living brothers.  One of them he does not speak too much with and does not know about his medical history.  The other is apparently healthy.  He has one healthy child.  His maternal uncles apparently had polio.  When I asked him to tell me further details about this, he states that one of them had to wear crutches due to severe leg deformans and then the other had leg deformities in only one leg.  He is fairly certain that they had polio.  He is unaware of any other family members with neurological conditions.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , He has occasional tinnitus.  He has difficulty sleeping.  Otherwise, a complete review of systems was obtained and was negative except for as mentioned above.  This is documented in the handwritten notes from today's visit.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:, ,Vital Signs:",
91,232,4264, Neurologic consultation was requested to evaluate her seizure medication and lethargy., Consult - History and Phy.,1.0, Neurologic Consultation ,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION: , Neurologic consultation was requested by Dr. X to evaluate her seizure medication and lethargy.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is well known to me.  She has symptomatic partial epilepsy secondary to a static encephalopathy, cerebral palsy, and shunted hydrocephalus related to prematurity.  She also has a history of factor V Leiden deficiency.  She was last seen at neurology clinic on 11/16/2007.  At that time, instructions were given to mom to maximize her Trileptal dose if seizures continue.  She did well on 2 mL twice a day without any sedation.  This past Friday, she had a 25-minute seizure reportedly.  This consisted of eye deviation, unresponsiveness, and posturing.  Diastat was used and which mom perceived was effective.  Her Trileptal dose was increased to 3 mL b.i.d. yesterday.,According to mom since her shunt revision on 12/18/2007, she has been sleepier than normal.  She appeared to be stable until this past Monday about six days ago, she became more lethargic and had episodes of vomiting and low-grade fevers.  According to mom, she had stopped vomiting since her hospitalization.  Reportedly, she was given a medication in the emergency room.  She still is lethargic, will not wake up spontaneously.  When she does awaken however, she is appropriate, and interacts with them.  She is able to eat well; however her overall p.o. intake has been diminished.  She has also been less feisty as her usual sounds.  She has been seizure free since her admission.,LABORATORY DATA: , Pertinent labs obtained here showed the following:  CRP is less than 0.3, CMP normal, and CBC within normal limits.  CSF cultures so far is negative.  Dr. Limon's note refers to a CSF, white blood cell count of 2, 1 RBC, glucose of 55, and protein of 64.  There are no imaging studies in the computer.  I believe that this may have been done at Kaweah Delta Hospital and reviewed by Dr. X, who indicated that there was no evidence of shunt malfunction or infection.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Trileptal 180 mg b.i.d., lorazepam 1 mg p.r.n., acetaminophen, and azithromycin.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  The patient was asleep, but easily aroused.  There was a brief period of drowsiness, which she had some jerky limb movements, but not seizures.  She eventually started crying and became agitated.  She made attempts to sit by bending her neck forward.  Fully awake, she sucks her bottle eagerly.,HEENT:  She was obviously visually impaired.  Pupils were 3 mm, sluggishly reactive to light.,EXTREMITIES:  Bilateral lower extremity spasticity was noted.  There was increased flexor tone in the right upper extremity.  IV was noted on the left hand.,ASSESSMENT:  ,Seizure breakthrough due to intercurrent febrile illness.  Her lethargy could be secondary to a viral illness with some component of medication effect since her Trileptal dose was increased yesterday and these are probable explanations if indeed shunt malfunction has been excluded.,I concur with Dr. X's recommendations.  I do not recommend any changes in Trileptal for now.  I will be available while she remains hospitalized.,","consult - history and phy., lethargy, encephalopathy, cerebral palsy, shunted hydrocephalus, seizure breakthrough, shunt malfunction, neurologic consultation, neurologic, seizure, trileptal"

The patient had a fever of 100.1 on 09/13/2006 taken rectally, and mom being a nurse, took the baby to the hospital and he was admitted for rule out sepsis.  All the sepsis workup was done, CBC, UA, LP, and CMP, and since a murmur was noted 2/5, he also had an echo done.  The patient was put on ampicillin and cefotaxime.  Echo results came back and they showed patent foramen ovale/ASD with primary pulmonary stenosis and then considering severe congenital heart disease, he was transferred here on vancomycin, ampicillin, and cefotaxime.  The patient was n.p.o. when he came in.  He was on 3/4 L of oxygen.  According to the note, it conveyed that he had some subcostal retractions.  On arriving here, baby looks very healthy.  He has no subcostal retractions.  He is not requiring any oxygen and he is positive for urine and stool.

His neurological examination is notable for sensory loss in a length-dependent fashion in his feet and legs with scant fasciculations in his calves.", Consult - History and Phy.,3.0, Multiple Neurological Symptoms ,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 63-year-old left-handed gentleman who presents for further evaluation of multiple neurological symptoms.  I asked him to discuss each symptom individually as he had a very hard time describing the nature of his problems.  He first mentioned that he has neck pain.  He states that he has had this for at least 15 years.  It is worse with movement.  It has progressed very slowly over the course of 15 years.  It is localized to the base of his neck and is sharp in quality.  He also endorses a history of gait instability.  This has been present for a few years and has been slightly progressively worsening.  He describes that he feels unsteady on his feet and ""walks like a duck.""  He has fallen about three or four times over the past year and a half.,He also describes that he has numbness in his feet.  When I asked him to describe this in more detail, the numbness is actually restricted to his toes.  Left is slightly more affected than the right.  He denies any tingling or paresthesias.  He also described that he is slowly losing control of his hands.  He thinks that he is dropping objects due to weakness or incoordination in his hands.  This has also been occurring for the past one to two years.  He has noticed that buttoning his clothes is more difficult for him.  He also does not have any numbness or tingling in the hands.  He does have a history of chronic low back pain.,At the end of the visit, when I asked him which symptom was most bothersome to him, he actually stated that his fatigue was most troublesome.  He did not even mention this on the initial part of my history taking.  When I asked him to describe this further, he states that he experiences a general exhaustion.  He basically lays in bed all day everyday.  I asked him if he was depressed, he states that he is treated for depression.  He is unsure if this is optimally treated.  As I just mentioned, he stays in bed almost all day long and does not engage in any social activities.  He does not think that he is necessarily sad.  His appetite is good.  He has never undergone any psychotherapy for depression.,When I took his history, I noticed that he is very slow in responding to my questions and also had a lot of difficulty recalling details of his history as well as names of physicians who he had seen in the past.  I asked if he had ever been evaluated for cognitive difficulties and he states that he did undergo testing at Johns Hopkins a couple of years ago.  He states that the results were normal and that specifically he did not have any dementia.,When I asked him when he was first evaluated for his current symptoms, he states that he saw Dr. X several years ago.  He believes that he was told that he had neuropathy but that it was unclear if it was due to his diabetes.  He told me that more recently he was evaluated by you after Dr. Y referred him for this evaluation.  He also saw Dr. Z for neurosurgical consultation a couple of weeks ago.

His neurological examination is notable for sensory loss in a length-dependent fashion in his feet and legs with scant fasciculations in his calves.  He has fairly normal or very mild increased reflexes including notably the presence of normal ankle jerks.,I think that the etiology of his symptoms is multifactorial.  He probably does have a mild peripheral neuropathy, but the sparing of ankle jerks suggested either the neuropathy is mild or that there is a superimposed myelopathic process such as a cervical or lumbosacral myelopathy.  He really is most concerned about the fatigue and I think it is possible due to suboptimally treated depression and suboptimally treated sleep apnea.  Whether he has another underlying muscular disorder such as a primary myopathy remains to be seen.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,1.  I scheduled him for repeat EMG and nerve conduction studies to evaluate for evidence of neuropathy or myopathy.,2.  I will review his films at our spine conference tomorrow although I am confident in Dr. Z's opinion that there is no surgical indication.,3.  I gave him a prescription for physical therapy to help with gait imbalance training as well as treatment for his neck pain.,4.  I believe that he needs to undergo psychotherapy for his depression.  It may also be worthwhile to adjust his medications, but I will defer to his primary care physician for managing this or for referring him to a therapist.  The patient is very open about proceeding with this suggestion.,5.  He does need to have his sleep apnea better controlled.  He states that he is not compliant because the face mask that he uses does not fit him well.  This should also be addressed.",

Apparently, she tripped backwards hitting her head on a wheelchair and, had although no loss consciousness, had altered mental status changes.  She was very confused, incomprehensible speech, and was not responding appropriately.  She was transported here stable, with no significant changes.  She ultimately upon arrival here was unchanged in that she was not responding appropriately.  She would have garbled speech, somewhat inappropriate at times, and unable to follow commands.  No other history was able to be obtained.  All pertinent history is documented within the records.  Physical examination also documented in the records, essentially as above.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , HEENT:  Without any obvious signs of trauma.  Pupils are equal and reactive.  Extraocular movements are difficult to assess with her eyes closed, but she will open to voice.  TMs, canals are normal without any signs of hemotympanum.  Nasal mucosa and oropharynx are normal.,NECK:  Nontender, full range of motion, was not examined initially, a collar was placed.,HEART:  Regular.,LUNGS:  Clear.,CHEST/BACK/ABDOMEN:  Without trauma.,SKIN:  With multiple excoriations from scratching and itching.,NEUROLOGIC:  Otherwise she has good sensation, withdrawals to pain.  When lifting the arm, she will hold them up and draw, let them down slowly.  With movement of the legs, she did straighten them back out slowly.  DTRs were intact and equal bilaterally.  Otherwise, the remainder of the examination was unable to be done because of patient's non-cooperation and mental status change.,LABORATORY DATA: , CT scan of the head was negative as was cervical spine.  She has a history of being on Coumadin.  Her INR is 1.92, CBC was with a white count of 3.8, 50% neutrophils, 8% bands.

101,242,4284," Patient with Hypertension, atrial fibrillation, large cardioembolic stroke initially to the right brain requesting medical management", Consult - History and Phy.,1.0, Medical Management Consult Request ,"CONSULT REQUEST FOR:, Medical management.,The patient has been in special procedures now for over 2 hours and I am unable to examine.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:, Obtained from Dr. A on an 81-year-old white female, who is right handed, who by history, had a large stroke to the right brain, causing left body findings, last night. She was unfortunately outside of the window for emergent treatment and had a negative CT scan of the head. Was started on protocol medication and that is similar to TPA, which is an investigational study.,During the evaluation she was found to be in atrial fibrillation on admission with hypertension that was treated with labetalol en route. Her heart rate was 130. She was brought down with Cardizem. She received the study drug in the night and about an hour later thought to have another large stroke effecting the opposite side of the brain, that the doctors and company think is probably cardioembolic and not related to the study drug, as TPA has no obvious known association with this.,At that time the patient became comatose and required emergent intubation and paralyzation. Her diastolic at that time rose up to 190, likely the result of the acute second stroke. She is currently in arteriogram and a clot has been extracted from the proximal left carotid, but there is still distal clot that they are working on. Dr. A has updated the family to her extremely guarded and critical prognosis.,At present, it is not known yet, we do not have the STAT echocardiogram, if she has a large clot in the heart or if she could have a patent foramen ovale clot in the legs that has been passed to the heart. Echo that is pending, and cannot be done till the patient is out of arteriogram, which is her lifesaving procedure right now.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:, Complete review of systems is unobtainable at present. From what I can tell, is that she is scheduled for an upcoming bladder distension surgery and I do not know if this is why she is off Coumadin for chronic AFib or what, at this point.

Dad died of an MI.,VACCINATION STATUS: Unknown.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS: On arrival were temperature 97.1, blood pressure 174/100, heart rate 100, 97%, respirations 15.,GENERAL: She was apparently alert and able to give history on arrival. Currently do not have any available vital signs or physical exam, as I cannot get to the patient.,LABORATORY: ,Reviewed and are remarkable for white count of 13 with 76 neutrophils. BMP is normal, except for a blood sugar of 157, hemoglobin A1c is pending. TSH 2.1, cholesterol 165, Digoxin 1.24, CPK 57. ABG 7.47/32/459 on 100%. Magnesium 1.5.

Chest x-ray has good ET tube placement. She has mild cardiomegaly. Some mild interstitial opacities consistent with OGD and minimal amount of atherosclerosis of the aorta.,CT scan of the head: I do not see any active bleeding.,X-rays of the shoulders appear intact to me and we are awaiting radiologies final approval on those.,ASSESSMENT/PLAN/PROBLEMS:,1. Large cardioembolic stroke initially to the right brain, with devastating effects, and now stroke into the left brain as well, with fluctuating mental status. Obviously she is in critical condition and stable with multiple strokes. One must also wonder if she could have a large clot burden below the heart and patent foramen ovale, etc. We need STAT records from her prior cardiologist and prior echocardiogram report to see exactly what are the details. I have ordered a STAT echo and to have the group that sees her read it, that if he has a large clot burdened in the heart or has distal clot with a PFO we may be able to better prognosticate at this point. Obviously, she cannot have any anticoagulants, except for the study drug, at present, which is her only chance and hopefully they will be able to retrieve most of the clot with emergency retrieval device as activated heroically, by Dr. A and interventional radiology.,2. Hypertension/atrial fibrillation: This will be a difficult management and the fact that she has been on a beta-blocker for Parkinson's, she may have withdrawal to the beta-blockers as we remove this. Given her atrial fibrillation, I do agree the safest agent right now is to use a Cardizem drip as needed and would use it for systolic greater than 160 to 180, or diastolics greater than 90 to 100. Also, would use it to control the atrial fibrillation. We would, however, be very cautious not to put her in heart block with the Digoxin and the beta-blocker on board. Weighing all risks and benefits, I think that given the fact that she has a beta-blocker on board and Digoxin, we would like to avoid the beta-blocker for vasospasm protection and will favor using calcium channel blocker for now. If, however, we run into trouble with this, I would prefer to switch her to Brevibloc or an Esmolol drip and see how she does, as she may withdraw from the beta-blocker. I will be watching this closely and managing the hypertension as I see fit at the moment, based on all factors. Will also ask cardiology if she has one that sees her here, to help guide this. Her Digoxin level is appropriate, as well as a TSH. I do not feel that we need to work this up further, other than the STAT echo and ultrasound of the leg.,3. Respiratory failure requiring ventilator: I have discussed this with Dr. Devlin, we do not feel the need to hyperventilate her at present. We will keep her comfortable on the breathing machine and try to keep her pH in a normal range, around 7.4, and her CO2 in the 30 to 40 range. If she has brain swelling, we will need to hyperventilate her to a pCO2 of 30 and a pH of 7.5, to optimize the cardiac arrhythmia potential of alkalosis weighed with the control of brain swelling.,4. Optimize electrolytes as you can.,5. Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis for now, with thigh-high TED hose, possibly SCDs, although I do not have experience with the vampire/venom to know if we need to worry about DIC which the SCDs may worsen. Will follow daily CBCs for that.,6. Nutrition: Will go ahead and start a low dose of tube feeds and hope that she does survive.,I will defer all updates to the family for the next 24 to 48 hours to Dr. Devlin's expertise, given her unknown and fluctuating neurologic prognosis.,Thank you so much for allowing us to participate in her care. We will be happy to do all medication treatment until the point that I feel that I would need any help from critical care. I believe that we will be able to manage her fully at this point, for simplicity sake.",

His confidence and self-esteem are significantly low.  He stated he has excessive somnolence, his energy level is extremely low, motivation is low, and he has a lack for personal interests.  He has had suicidal ideation, but this is currently in remission.  Furthermore, he continues to have hopeless thoughts and crying spells.  Mr. T stated these symptoms appeared approximately two months ago.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , On March 25, 2003, Mr. T was fired from his job secondary, to an event at which he stated he was first being harassed by another employee."" This other, employee had confronted Mr. T with a very aggressive, verbal style, where this employee had placed his face directly in front of Mr. T was spitting on him, and called him ""bitch."" Mr. T then retaliated, and went to hit the other employee.  Due to this event, Mr. T was fired.  It should be noted that Mr. T stated he had been harassed by this individual for over a year and had reported the harassment to his boss and was told to ""deal with it."",There are no other apparent stressors in Mr. T's life at this time or in recent months.  Mr. T stated that work was his entire life and he based his entire identity on his work ethic.  It should be noted that Mr. T was a process engineer for Plum Industries for the past 14 years.,PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:,  There is no evidence of any psychiatric hospitalizations or psychiatric interventions other than a recent visit to Mr. T's family physician, Dr. B at which point Mr. T was placed on Lexapro with an unknown dose at this time.  Mr. T is currently seeing Dr. J for psychotherapy where he has been in treatment since April, 2003.,PAST PSYCHIATRIC REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  Mr. T denied any history throughout his childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood for depressive, anxiety, or psychotic disorders.  He denied any suicide attempts, or profound suicidal or homicidal ideation.  Mr. T furthermore stated that his family psychiatric history is unremarkable.,SUBSTANCE ABUSE HISTORY:,  Mr. T stated he used alcohol following his divorce in 1993, but has not used it for the last two years.  No other substance abuse was noted.,LEGAL HISTORY: , Currently, charges are pending over the above described incident.,MEDICAL HISTORY: , Mr. T denied any hospitalizations, surgeries, or current medications use for any heart disease, lung disease, liver disease, kidney disease, gastrointestinal disease, neurological disease, closed head injury, endocrine disease, infectious, blood or muscles disease other than stating he has a hiatal hernia and hypercholesterolemia.,PERSONAL AND SOCIAL HISTORY: , Mr. T was born in Dwyne, Missouri, with no complications associated with his birth.  Originally, he was raised by both parents, but they separated at an early age.  When he was about seven years old, he was raised by his mother and stepfather.  He did not sustain a relationship with his biological father from that time on.  He stated his parents moved a lot, and because this many times he was picked on in his new environments, Mr. T stated he was, at times, a rebellious teenager, but he denied any significant inability to socialize, and denied any learning disabilities or the need for special education.,Mr. T stated his stepfather was somewhat verbally abusive, and that he committed suicide when Mr. T was 18 years old.  He graduated from high school and began work at Dana Corporation for two to three years, after which he worked as an energy, auditor for a gas company.  He then became a homemaker while his wife worked for Chrysler for approximately two years.  Mr. T was married for eleven years, and divorced in 1993.  He has a son who is currently 20 years old.  After being a home maker, Mr. T worked for his mother in a restaurant, and moved on from there to work for Borg-Warner corporation for one to two years before beginning at Plum Industries, where he worked for 14 years and worked his way up to lead engineer.,Mental Status Exam:  Mr. T presented with a hyper vigilant appearance, his eye contact was appropriate to the interview, and his motor behavior was tense.  At times he showed some involuntary movements that would be more akin to a resting tremor.  There was no psychomotor retardation, but there was some mild psychomotor excitement.  His speech was clear, concise, but pressured.  His attitude was overly negative and his mood was significant for moderate depression, anxiety, anhedonia and loneliness, and mild evidence of anger.  There was no evidence of euphoria or diurnal mood variation.  His affective expression was restricted range, but there was no evidence of lability.  At times, his affective tone and facial expressions were inappropriate to the interview.  There was no evidence of auditory, visual, olfactory, gustatory, tactile or visceral hallucinations.  There was no evidence of illusions, depersonalizations, or derealizations.  Mr. T presented with a sequential and goal directed stream of thought.  There was no evidence of incoherence, irrelevance, evasiveness, circumstantiality, loose associations, or concrete thinking.  There was no evidence of delusions; however, there was some ambivalence, guilt, and self-derogatory thoughts.  There was evidence of concreteness for similarities and proverbs.  His intelligence was average.  His concentration was mildly impaired, and there was no evidence of distractibility.  He was oriented to time, place, person and situation.  There was no evidence of clouded consciousness or dissociation.  His memory was intact for immediate, recent, and remote events.,He presented with poor appetite, easily fatigued, and decreased libidinal drive, as well as excessive somnolence.  There was a moderate preoccupation with his physical health pertaining to his headaches.  His judgment was poor for finances, family relations, social relations, employment, and, at this time, he had no future plans.  Mr. T's insight is somewhat moderate as he is aware of his contribution to the problem.  His motivation for getting well is good as he accepts offered treatment, complies with recommended treatment, and seeks effective treatments.  He has a well-developed empathy for others and capacity for affection.,There was no evidence of entitlement, egocentricity, controllingness, intimidation, or manipulation.  His credibility seemed good.  There was no evidence for potential self-injury, suicide, or violence.  The reliability and completeness of information was very good, and there were no barriers to communication.  The information gathered was based on the patient's self-report and objective testing and observation.  His attitude toward the examiner was neutral and his attitude toward the examination process was neutral.  There was no evidence for indices of malingering as there was no marked discrepancy between claimed impairment and objective findings, and there was no lack of cooperation with the evaluation or poor compliance with treatment, and no evidence of antisocial personality disorder.,IMPRESSIONS: , Major Depressive Disorder, single episode,RECOMMENDATIONS AND PLAN: , I recommend Mr. T continue with psychopharmacologic care as well as psychotherapy.  At this time, the excessive amount of psychiatric symptoms would impede Mr. T from seeking employment.  Furthermore, it appears that the primary precipitating event had occurred on March 25, 2003, when Mr. T was fired from his job after being harassed for over a year.  As Mr. T placed his entire identity and sense of survival on his work, this was a deafening blow to his psychological functioning.  Furthermore, it only appears logical that this would precipitate a major depressive episode.","consult - history and phy., muscle tremor, headaches, excessive nervousness, poor concentration, independent medical evaluation, psychopharmacologic, poor ability to focus, major depressive disorder, tremor, depressive, psychiatric, "

He is unable to care for himself. ,I reviewed the information that was sent down with him from the nursing home which includes his medical history.,MEDICATIONS:  ,Keppra 1500 twice a day and Decadron 6 mg four times a day.  His other medicines include oxycodone, an aspirin a day, Prilosec, Dilantin 300 a day, and Flagyl.,FINDINGS:,  On examination, he is lying on the stretcher.  He has oxygen on and has periods of spontaneous hyperventilation.  He is unable to lift his right arm or right leg.  He has an expressive dysphasia and confusion.,I reviewed the imaging studies from summer from the beginning of 10/07, end of 10/07 as well as the current MRI he had last week.  This shows that he has had progression of disease with recurrence along the surface of the brain and there is significant brain edema.  This is a malignant meningioma by diagnosis.,ASSESSMENT/PLAN: , In summary, Mr. A has significant disability and is not independent currently.  I believe that because of this that the likelihood of benefit from surgery is small and there is a very good chance that he would not be able to recover from surgery.  I do not think that surgery will help his quality of life and a need to control the tumor would be dependent on another therapy impacting the tumor.  Given that there are not good therapies and chemotherapy would be the option at the moment, and he certainly is not in a condition where chemotherapy would be given, I believe that surgery would not be in his best interest.  I discussed this both with him, although it is not clear to me how much he understood, as well as his family.","consult - history and phy., seizures, hemiparesis, tumor, seizures hemiparesis, malignant meningioma, chemotherapy, malignant, meningioma, aspirin"

Patient has a history of chronic back pain, dating back to an accident that he states he suffered two years ago.  He states he helped a friend unload a motorcycle from a vehicle two-and-a-half days ago, after which he ""felt it"" in his lower back.  The following day (two days ago), he states he rode to Massachusetts and Maine to pick up clients.  He feels that this aggravated his chronic back pain as well.  He also claims to have a screw in his right hip from a previous surgery to repair a pelvic fracture.  He is being prescribed Ultram, Celebrex, gabapentin, and amitriptyline by his PCP for his chronic back pain.  He states that his PCP has informed him that he does not prescribe opiate medications for chronic back pain.,The patient did self-refer to another physician, who suggested that he follow up at a pain clinic for his chronic back pain to discuss other alternatives, particularly the medications that the patient feels that he needs.  Patient states he did not do this because he was feeling well at that time.,The patient did present to our emergency room last night, at which time he saw Dr. X.  He was given a prescription for 12 Vicodin as well as some to take home last night.  The patient has not picked up his prescription as of yet and informed the triage nurse that he was concerned that he would not have enough to last through the weekend.  Patient states he also has methadone and Darvocet at home from previous prescription and is wondering if he should restart these medicines.  He is on several medications, the list of which is attached to the chart.,MEDICATIONS: , In addition to the aforementioned medications, he is on Cymbalta, pantoprazole, and a multivitamin.,ALLERGIES:,  HE IS ALLERGIC TO RELAFEN (ITCHING).,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient is married and lives with his wife.,Nursing notes were reviewed with which I agree.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION,VITAL SIGNS:  Pulse is elevated at 105.  Temp and other vitals signs are all within normal limits.,GENERAL:  Patient is a middle-aged white male who is sitting on the stretcher in no acute distress.,BACK:  Exam of the back shows some generalized tenderness on palpation of the musculature surrounding the lumbar spine, more so on the right than on the left.  There is a well-healed upper lumbar incision from his previous L1-L2 fusion.  There is no erythema, ecchymosis, or soft-tissue swelling.  Mobility is generally very good without obvious signs of discomfort.,HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.,LUNGS:  Clear without rales, rhonchi, or wheezes.,MUSCULOSKELETAL:  With the patient supine, there is some discomfort in the lower back with bent-knee flexion of both hips as well as with straight leg abduction of the left leg.  There is some mild discomfort on internal and external rotation of the hips as well.  DTRs are 1+ at the knees and trace at the ankles.,I explained to the patient that he is suffering from a chronic condition and as his PCP has made it clear that he is unwilling to prescribe opiate medication, which the patient feels that he needs, and he is obligated to follow up at the pain clinic as suggested by the other physician even if he is having a ""good day.""  I explained to him that if he did not investigate other alternatives to what his PCP is willing to prescribe, then on a ""bad day,"" he will have nowhere else to turn.  I explained to him that some emergency physicians do chose to use opiates for a short term as Dr. X did last night.  It is unclear if the patient is looking for a different opiate medication, but I do not think it is wise to give him more, particularly as he has not even filled the prescription that was given to him last night.  I did suggest that he not restart his methadone and Darvocet at this time as he is already on five different medications for his back (Celebrex, tramadol, amitriptyline, gabapentin, and the Vicodin that he was given last night).  I did suggest that we could try a different anti-inflammatory if he felt that the Celebrex is not helping.  The patient is agreeable to this.,ASSESSMENT,1.  Lumbar muscle strain.,2.

107,248,4295," Briefly, the patient has a lumbosacral polyradiculopathy that is temporally related to the epidural anesthesia given to her in October of 2008.", Consult - History and Phy.,3.0, Lumbosacral Polyradiculopathy ,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 35-year-old woman who reports that on the 30th of October 2008, she had a rupture of her membranes at nine months of pregnancy, and was admitted to hospital and was given an epidural anesthetic.  I do not have the records from this hospital admission, but apparently the epidural was administered for approximately 14 to 18 hours.  She was sitting up during the epidural.,She did not notice any difference in her lower extremities at the time she had the epidural; however, she reports that she was extremely sleepy and may not have been aware of any change in strength or sensation in her lower extremities at that time.  She delivered on the 31st of October, by Cesarean section, because she had failed to progress and had pyrexia.,She also had a Foley catheter placed at that time.  On the 1st of November 2008, they began to mobilize her and it was at that time that she first noticed that she could not walk.  She was aware that she could not move her legs at all, and then within a few days, she was aware that she could move toes in the left foot but could not move her right foot at all.  Since that time, there has been a gradual improvement in strength to the point that she now has limited movement in her left leg and severely restricted movement in her right leg.  She is not able to walk by herself, and needs assistance to stand.  She was discharged from hospital after the Cesarean section on the 3rd of November.  Unfortunately, we do not have the records and we do not know what the discussion was between the anesthesiologist and the patient at the time of discharge.  She was then seen at ABC Hospital on November 05, 2008.  She had an MRI scan of her spine, which showed no evidence of an abnormality, specifically there were no cord changes and no evidence of a hematoma.  She also had an EMG study at that time by Dr. X, which was abnormal but not diagnostic and this was repeated again in December.  At the present time, she also complains of a pressure in both her legs and in her thighs.  She complains that her right foot hurts and that she has some hyperesthesia there.  She has been taking gabapentin to try to reduce the discomfort, although she is on a very low dose and the effect is minimal.  She has no symptoms in her arms, her bowel and bladder function is normal, and her bulbar function is normal.  There is no problem with her vision, swallowing, or respiratory function.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Unremarkable except as noted above.  She has seasonal allergies.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  Gabapentin 300 mg b.i.d., Centrum once a day, and another multivitamin.,ALLERGIES: , She has no medication allergies, but does have seasonal allergies.,FAMILY HISTORY: , There is a family history of diabetes and hypertension.  There is no family history of a neuropathy or other neurological disease.  She has one child, a son, born on October 31, 2008.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient is a civil engineer, who currently works from home.  She is working approximately half time because of limitations imposed on her by her disability, need to attend frequent physical therapy, and also the needs of looking after her baby.  She does not smoke and does not drink and has never done either.,GENERAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS:  P 74, BP 144/75, and a pain score of 0.,GENERAL:  Her general physical examination was unremarkable.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Normal first and second heart sound, regular pulse with normal volume.,RESPIRATORY:  Unremarkable, both lung bases were clear, and respiration was normal.,GI:  Unremarkable, with no organomegaly and normal bowel sounds.,NEUROLOGICAL EXAM:,MSE:  The patient's orientation was normal, fund of knowledge was normal, memory was normal, speech was normal, calculation was normal, and immediate and long-term recall was normal.  Executive function was normal.,CRANIAL NERVES:  The cranial nerve examination II through XII was unremarkable.  Both disks were normal, with normal retina.  Pupils were equal and reactive to light.  Eye movements were full.  Facial sensation and strength was normal.  Bulbar function was normal.  The trapezius had normal strength.,MOTOR:  Muscle tone showed a slight increase in tone in the lower extremities, with normal tone in the upper extremities.  Muscle strength was 5/5 in all muscle groups in the upper extremities.  In the lower extremities, the hip flexors were 1/5 bilaterally, hip extensors were 1/5 bilaterally, knee extension on the right was 1/5 and on the left was 3-/5, knee flexion was 2/5 on the right and 3-/5 on the left, foot dorsiflexion was 0/5 on the right and 1/5 on the left, foot plantar flexion was 4-/5 on the right and 4+/5 on the left, toe extension was 0/5 on the right and 4-/5 on the left, toe flexion was 4-/5 on the right and 4+/5 on the left.,REFLEXES:  Reflexes in the upper extremities were 2+ bilaterally.  In the lower extremities, they were 0 bilaterally at the knee and ankles.  The abdominal reflexes were present above the umbilicus and absent below the umbilicus.  The plantar responses were mute.  The jaw reflex was normal.,SENSATION:  Vibration was moderately decreased in the right great toe and was mildly decreased in the left great toe.  There was a sensory level to light touch at approximately T7 posteriorly and approximately T9 anteriorly.  There was a range of sensation, but clearly there was a decrease in sensation below this level but not complete loss of sensation.  To pain, the sensory level is even less clear, but appeared to be at about T7 on the right side.  In the lower extremities, there was a slight decrease in pin and light touch in the right great toe compared to the left.  There was no evidence of allodynia or hyperesthesia.  Joint position sense was mildly reduced in the right toe and normal on the left.,COORDINATION:  Coordination for rapid alternating movements and finger-to-nose testing was normal.  Coordination could not be tested in the lower extremities.,GAIT:  The patient was unable to stand and therefore we were unable to test gait or Romberg's.  There was no evidence of focal back tenderness.,REVIEW OF OUTSIDE RECORDS: , I have reviewed the records from ABC Hospital, including the letter from Dr. Y and the EMG report dated 12/17/2008 from Dr. X. The EMG report shows evidence of a lumbosacral polyradiculopathy below approximately T6.  The lower extremity sensory responses are essentially normal; however, there is a decrease in the amplitude of the motor responses with minimal changes in latency.  I do have the MRI of lumbar spine report from 11/06/2008 with and without contrast.  This showed a minimal concentric disc bulge of L4-L5 without disc herniation, but was otherwise unremarkable.  The patient brought a disc with a most recent MRI study; however, we were unable to open this on our computers.  The verbal report is that the study was unremarkable except for some gadolinium enhancement in the lumbar nerve roots.  A Doppler of the lower extremities showed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis in either lower extremity.  Chest x-ray showed some scoliosis on the lumbar spine, curve to the left, but no evidence of other abnormalities.  A CT pelvis study performed on November 07, 2008 showed some nonspecific fluid in the subcutaneous fat of the back, posterior to L4 and L5 levels; however, there were no pelvic masses or other abnormalities.  We were able to obtain an update of the report from the MRI of the lumbar spine with and without contrast dated 12/30/2008.  The complete study included the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine.  There was diffuse enhancement of the nerve roots of the cauda equina that had increased in enhancement since prior exam in November.  It was also reported that the patient was given intravenous methylprednisolone and this had had no effect on strength in her lower extremities.,IMPRESSION: , The patient has a condition that is temporarily related to the epidural injection she was given at the end of October 2008, prior to her Cesarean section.  It appears she became aware of weakness within two days of the administration of the epidural, she was very tired during the epidural and may have missed some change in her neurological function.  She was severely weak in both lower extremities, slightly worse on the right than the left.  There has been some interval improvement in her strength since the beginning of November 2008.  Her EMG study from the end of December is most consistent with a lumbosacral polyradiculopathy.  The MRI findings of gadolinium enhancement in the lumbar nerve roots would be most consistent with an inflammatory radiculitis most likely related to the epidural anesthesia or administration of the epidural.  There had been no response to IV methylprednisolone given to her at ABC.  The issue of having a lumbar puncture to look for evidence of inflammatory cells or an elevated protein had been discussed with her at both ABC and by myself.  The patient did not wish to consider a lumbar puncture because of concerns that this might worsen her condition.  At the present time, she is able to stand with aid but is unable to walk.  There is no evidence on her previous EMG of a demyelinating neuropathy.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,1.  The diagnostic issues were discussed with the patient at length.  She is informed that this is still early in the course of the problem and that we expect her to show some improvement in her function over the next one to two years, although it is unclear as to how much function she will regain.,2.  She is strongly recommended to continue with vigorous physical therapy, and to continue with the plan to mobilize her as much as possible, with the goal of trying to get her ambulatory.  If she is able to walk, she will need bilateral AFOs for her ankles, to improve her overall mobility.  I am not prescribing these because at the present time she does not need them.,3.  We discussed increasing the dose of gabapentin.  The paresthesias that she has may indicate that she is actually regaining some sensory function, although there is a concern that as recovery continues, she may be left with significant neuropathic pain.  If this is the case, I have advised her to increase her gabapentin dose from 300 mg b.i.d. gradually up to 300 mg four times a day and then to 600 mg to 900 mg four times a day.  She may need other neuropathic pain medications as needed.  She will determine whether her current symptoms are significant enough to require this increase in dosage.,4.  The patient will follow up with Dr. Y and his team at ABC Hospital.  She will also continue with physical therapy within the ABC system.",

The patient is very difficult to obtain information from; however, he appears to be having frequent nausea and vomiting with an aspiration pneumonia and abdominal discomfort.  In addition, this hospitalization, he has undergone an upper endoscopy, which found a small ulcer after dropping his hematocrit and becoming anemic.  He had a CT scan on Friday, 11/02/07, which apparently showed pneumatosis and his cecum worrisome for ischemic colitis as well as bilateral hydronephrosis and multiple liver lesions, which could be metastatic disease versus cysts.  In discussions with the patient, he had multiple bowel movements yesterday and is currently passing flatus and has epigastric pain.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,Obtained from the medical chart.

Nothing was done about it at that time as the patient appeared to not be symptomatic, but he continues to have nausea and vomiting with abdominal pain, but the fact that pneumatosis was found 2 days ago and the patient has survived this long indicates this may be a benign process at the moment, and I would recommend getting a repeat CT scan to assess it further to see if there is worsening of pneumatosis versus resolution to further evaluate the liver lesions and make decisions regarding planning at that time.  The patient has frequent desaturations secondary to his aspiration pneumonia, and any surgical procedure or any surgical intervention would certainly require intubation, which would then necessitate long-term ventilator care as he is not someone who would be able to come off of a ventilator very well in his current state.  So we will look at the CT scan and make decisions based on the findings as far as that is concerned.","consult - history and phy., ischemic cecum, metastatic disease, bilateral hydronephrosis, chronic alcohol abuse, acute renal failure, copd, anemia, gastric ulcer, pneumatosis coli, cecum, aspiration pneumonia, aspiration, ischemic, atrial, metastatic, hydronephrosis, fibrillation, pneumatosis, pneumonia, "

Ultimately, imaging study shows an MRI with absent genu of the corpus callosum and thinning of the splenium of the corpus callosum, showing a pattern of cerebral dysgenesis.  He has had severe global developmental delay, and is nonverbal.  He can follow objects with his eyes, but has no ability to interact with his environment to any great degree.  He has noted if any purposeful use of the hands.  He has abnormal movements constantly, which are more choreiform and dystonic.  He has spastic quadriparesis, which is variable at times.  The patient is unable to sit or stand, and receives all his nutrition via G-tube.,The patient began having seizures in infancy presenting as infantile spasms.  I began seeing him at 20 months of age.  At that point, he had undergone workup in Seattle, Washington and then was seeing Dr. X, child neurologist in Mexico, who started Vigabatrin for infantile spasms.  The patient had benefit from this medication, and was doing well at that time with regard to that seizure type.  He initially was on phenobarbital, which failed to give him benefit.  He continued on phenobarbital; however, for a long period time thereafter.  The patient then began having more tonic seizures after his episodic spasms had subsided, and failed several medication trials including valproic acid, Topamax, and Zonegran at least briefly.  Upon starting Lamictal, he began to have benefit and then actually had 1-year seizure freedom before having an isolated seizure or 2.  Over the next 6 months to a year, he only had few further seizures, and was doing well in a general sense.  It was more recently that he began having new seizure events that have not responded to higher doses of Lamictal up to 15 mg/kg/day.  These events manifest as tonic spells with eye deviation and posturing.  Mother reports flexion of the upper extremities, extension with lower extremities.  During that time, he is not able to cry or say any sounds.  These events last from seconds to minutes, and occur at least multiple times per week.  There are times where he has none for a few days and other times where he has multiple days in a row with events.  He has another event manifesting as flexion of the upper extremities and extension lower extremities where he turns red and cries throughout.  He may vomit after these episodes, then seems to calm down.  It is unclear whether this is a seizure or whether the patient is still responsive.,MEDICATIONS:,  The patient's medications include Lamictal for a total of 200 mg twice a day.  It is a 150 mg tablet and 25 mg tablets.  He is on Zonegran using 25 mg capsules 2 capsules twice daily, and baclofen 10 mg three times day.  He has other medications including the Xopenex and Atrovent.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , At this time is negative any fevers, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal complaints, rashes, arthritis, or arthralgias.  No respiratory or cardiovascular complaints.

He is able to fix and follow objects briefly.  He is unable to reach for objects.  He exhibits constant choreiform movements when excited.  These are more prominent in the upper extremities and lower extremities.  He has some dystonic posture with flexion of the wrist and fingers bilaterally.  He also has plantar flexion at the ankles bilaterally.  His cranial nerves reveal that his pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements are intact other than bilateral esotropia.  His face moves symmetrically.  Palate elevates in midline.  Hearing appears intact bilaterally.,Motor exam reveals dystonic and variable tone, overall there is mild in spasticity both upper and lower extremities as described above.  He has clonus at the ankles bilaterally, and some valgus contracture of the ankles.  His sensation is intact to light touch bilaterally.  Deep tendon reflexes are 2 to 3+ bilaterally.,IMPRESSION/PLAN: , This is a 9-year-old male with congenital brain malformation and intractable epilepsy.  He has microcephaly as well as dystonic cerebral palsy.  He had a re-emergence of seizures, which are difficult to classify, although some sound like tonic episodes and others are more concerning for non-epileptic phenomenon, such as discomfort.  He is admitted for video EEG to hopefully capture both of these episodes and further clarify the seizure type or types.  He will remain hospitalized for probably at least 48 hours to 72 hours.  He could be discharged sooner if multiple events are captured.  His medications, we will continue his current dose of Zonegran and Lamictal for now.  Both of these medications are very long acting, discontinuing them while in the hospital may simply result in severe seizures after discharge.","consult - history and phy., brain malformation, congenital, intractable epilepsy, global developmental delay, video eeg, seizures, intractable, eeg, "

122,264,4332, Left hip fracture.  The patient is a 53-year-old female with probable pathological fracture of the left proximal femur., Consult - History and Phy.,1.0, Hip Fracture - ER Consult ,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION: , Left hip fracture.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a pleasant 53-year-old female with a known history of sciatica, apparently presented to the emergency room due to severe pain in the left lower extremity and unable to bear weight.  History was obtained from the patient.  As per the history, she reported that she has been having back pain with left leg pain since past 4 weeks.  She has been using a walker for ambulation due to disabling pain in her left thigh and lower back.  She was seen by her primary care physician and was scheduled to go for MRI yesterday.  However, she was walking and her right foot got caught on some type of rug leading to place excessive weight on her left lower extremity to prevent her fall.  Since then, she was unable to ambulate.  The patient called paramedics and was brought to the emergency room.  She denied any history of fall.  She reported that she stepped the wrong way causing the pain to become worse.  She is complaining of severe pain in her lower extremity and back pain.  Denies any tingling or numbness.  Denies any neurological symptoms.  Denies any bowel or bladder incontinence.,X-rays were obtained which were remarkable for left hip fracture.  Orthopedic consultation was called for further evaluation and management.  On further interview with the patient, it is noted that she has a history of malignant melanoma, which was diagnosed approximately 4 to 5 years ago.  She underwent surgery at that time and subsequently, she was noted to have a spread to the lymphatic system and lymph nodes for which she underwent surgery in 3/2008.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Sciatica and melanoma.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  ,As discussed above, surgery for melanoma and hysterectomy.,ALLERGIES: , NONE.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , Denies any tobacco or alcohol use.  She is divorced with 2 children.  She lives with her son.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  The patient is well developed, well nourished in mild distress secondary to left lower extremity and back pain.,MUSCULOSKELETAL:  Examination of the left lower extremity, there is presence of apparent shortening and external rotation deformity.  Tenderness to palpation is present.  Leg rolling is positive for severe pain in the left proximal hip.  Further examination of the spine is incomplete secondary to severe leg pain.  She is unable to perform a straight leg raising.  EHL/EDL 5/5.  2+ pulses are present distally.  Calf is soft and nontender.  Homans sign is negative.  Sensation to light touch is intact.,IMAGING:,  AP view of the hip is reviewed.  Only 1 limited view is obtained.  This is a poor quality x-ray with a lot of soft tissue shadow.  This x-ray is significant for basicervical-type femoral neck fracture.  Lesser trochanter is intact.  This is a high intertrochanteric fracture/basicervical.  There is presence of lytic lesion around the femoral neck, which is not well delineated on this particular x-ray.  We need to order repeat x-rays including AP pelvis, femur, and knee.,LABS:,  Have been reviewed.,ASSESSMENT: , The patient is a 53-year-old female with probable pathological fracture of the left proximal femur.,DISCUSSION AND PLAN: , Nature and course of the diagnosis has been discussed with the patient.  Based on her presentation without any history of obvious fall or trauma and past history of malignant melanoma, this appears to be a pathological fracture of the left proximal hip.  At the present time, I would recommend obtaining a bone scan and repeat x-rays, which will include AP pelvis, femur, hip including knee.  She denies any pain elsewhere.  She does have a past history of back pain and sciatica, but at the present time, this appears to be a metastatic bone lesion with pathological fracture.  I have discussed the case with Dr. X and recommended oncology consultation.,With the above fracture and presentation, she needs a left hip hemiarthroplasty versus calcar hemiarthroplasty, cemented type.  Indication, risk, and benefits of left hip hemiarthroplasty has been discussed with the patient, which includes, but not limited to bleeding, infection, nerve injury, blood vessel injury, dislocation early and late, persistent pain, leg length discrepancy, myositis ossificans, intraoperative fracture, prosthetic fracture, need for conversion to total hip replacement surgery, revision surgery, DVT, pulmonary embolism, risk of anesthesia, need for blood transfusion, and cardiac arrest.  She understands above and is willing to undergo further procedure.  The goal and the functional outcome have been explained.  Further plan will be discussed with her once we obtain the bone scan and the radiographic studies.  We will also await for the oncology feedback and clearance.,Thank you very much for allowing me to participate in the care of this patient.  I will continue to follow up.","consult - history and phy., calcar, proximal femur, pathological fracture, hip, fracture, hemiarthroplasty, melanoma, "

Pneumonia in the face of fairly severe Crohn disease with protein-losing enteropathy and severe malnutrition with anasarca.,2.  He also has anemia and leukocytosis, which may be related to his Crohn disease as well as his underlying pneumonia.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , At this time, I believe evaluation of protein intake and dietary supplement will be most appropriate.  I believe that he needs a calorie count.  We will check on a sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, LDH, prealbumin, thyroid, and iron studies in the morning with his laboratory studies that are already ordered.  I have recommended strongly to him that when he is out of the hospital, he return to the care of his gastroenterologist.  I will help in anyway that I can to improve the patient's laboratory abnormalities.  However, his lower extremity edema is primarily due to his marked hypoalbuminemia and I do not believe that diuretics will help him at this time.  I have explained this in detail to the patient and his family.  Everybody expresses understanding and all questions were answered.  At this time, follow him up during his hospital stay and plan to see him in the office as well.",

She is on 2-1/2 liters of oxygen and does require that.  Her diet has been fluctuating.  They have been trying to figure out what works best with her.  She has been on some Pediasure for the increased calories but that really makes her distended in the abdomen and constipates her.

She had previously worked at the bank in Conway Springs in Norwich and had several other jobs related to accounting or management services.  She does have an MBA in business.

We did complete a mini mental state exam including clock drawing, sentence writing, signature, etc.  She does score a maximum score of 30/30 and all other tasks were completed without difficulty or any hesitation.  I did spend quite a bit of time reassuring her as well.  She is currently on Zoloft 100 mg which I think is an appropriate dose.  We will have her continue on that.  She did verbalize understanding and that she actually felt better after our discussion concerning these issues.  At some point in time; however, I would possibly recommend job change if this one would persist as far as the stress levels.

Belly and back pain.  ,SUBJECTIVE: , Mr. ABC is a 2-year-old boy, who is brought in by parents, stating that the child keeps complaining of belly and back pain.  This does not seem to be slowing him down.  They have not noticed any change in his urine or bowels.  They have not noted him to have any fevers or chills or any other illness.  They state he is otherwise acting normally.  He is eating and drinking well.  He has not had any other acute complaints, although they have noted a foul odor coming from his nose.  Apparently, he was seen here a few weeks ago for a foreign body in the right nose, which was apparently a piece of cotton; this was removed and placed on antibiotics.  His nose got better and then started to become malodorous again.  Mother restarted him on the remainder of the antibiotics and they are also stating that they think there is something still in there.  Otherwise, he has not had any runny nose, earache, no sore throat.  He has not had any cough, congestion.  He has been acting normally.  Eating and drinking okay.  No other significant complaints.  He has not had any pain with bowel movement or urination, nor have they noted him to be more frequently urinating, then again he is still on a diaper.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Otherwise negative.,ALLERGIES: , No allergies.,MEDICATIONS: , No medications other than recent amoxicillin.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , Parents do smoke around the house.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , VITAL SIGNS:  Stable.

165,309,4424, Patient returns for his first followup after shunt surgery., Consult - History and Phy.,3.0, First Followup - Shunt Surgery ,"REASON FOR VISIT:,  Mr. A is an 86-year-old man who returns for his first followup after shunt surgery.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,I have followed Mr. A since May 2008.  He presented with eight to ten years of progressive gait impairment, cognitive impairment, and decreased bladder control.  We established a diagnosis of adult hydrocephalus with the spinal catheter protocol in June of 2008 and ,Mr. A underwent shunt surgery performed by Dr. X on August 1st.  A Medtronic Strata programmable shunt in the ventriculoperitoneal configuration programmed at level 2.0 was placed.,Mr. A comes today with his daughter, Pam and together they give his history.,Mr. A has had no hospitalizations or other illnesses since I last saw him.  With respect to his walking, his daughter tells me that he is now able to walk to the dining room just fine, but could not before his surgery.  His balance has improved though he still has some walking impairment.  With respect to his bladder, initially there was some improvement, but he has leveled off and he wears a diaper.,With respect to his cognition, both Pam and the patient say that his thinking has improved.  The other daughter, Patty summarized it best according to two of them.  She said, ""I feel like I can have a normal conversation with him again.""  Mr. A has had no headaches and no pain at the shunt site or at the abdomen.,MEDICATIONS: , Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d., metoprolol 25 mg p.o. q.d., Flomax 0.4 mg p.o. q.d., Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.d., Detrol LA 4 mg p.o. q.d., lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d., Imodium daily, Omega-3, fish oil, and Lasix.,MAJOR FINDINGS:,  Mr. A is a pleasant and cooperative man who is able to converse easily though his daughter adds some details.,Vital Signs:  Blood pressure 124/80, heart rate is 64, respiratory rate is 18, weight 174 pounds, and pain is 0/10.,The shunt site was clean, dry, and intact and confirmed at a setting of 2.0.,Mental Status:  Tested for recent and remote memory, attention span, concentration, and fund of knowledge.  He scored 26/30 on the MMSE when tested with spelling and 25/30 when tested with calculations.  Of note, he was able to get two of the three memory words with cuing and the third one with multiple choice.  This was a slight improvement over his initial score of 23/30 with calculations and 24/30 with spelling and at that time he was unable to remember any memory words with cuing and only one with multiple choice.,Gait:  Tested using the Tinetti assessment tool.  He was tested without an assistive device and received a gait score of 6-8/12 and a balance of score of 12/16 for a total score of 18-20/28.  This has slightly improved from his initial score of 15-17/28.,Cranial Nerves:  Pupils are equal.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Face symmetric.  No dysarthria.,Motor:  Normal for bulk and strength.,Coordination:  Slow for finger-to-nose.,IMAGING: , CT scan was reviewed from 10/15/2008.  It shows a frontal horn span at the level of foramen of Munro of 4.6 cm with a 3rd ventricular contour that is flat with the span of 10 mm.  By my reading, there is a tiny amount of blood in the right frontal region with just a tiny subdural collection.  This was not noticed by the radiologist who stated no extraaxial fluid collections.  There is also substantial small vessel ischemic change.,ASSESSMENT: , Mr. A has made some improvement since shunt surgery.,PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES:,1.  Adult hydrocephalus (331.5).,2.  Gait impairment (781.2).,3.  Urinary incontinence and urgency (788.33).,4.  Cognitive impairment (290.0).,PLAN:,  I had a long discussion with Mr. A and his daughter.  We are all pleased that he has started to make some improvement with his hydrocephalus because I believe I see a tiny fluid collection in the right parietal region, I would like to leave the setting at 2.0 for another three months before we consider changing the shunt.  I do not believe that this tiny amount of fluid is symptotic and it was not documented by the radiologist when he read the CT scan.,Mr. A asked me about whether he will be able to drive again.  Unfortunately, I think it is unlikely that his speed of movement will improve to a level that he will be able to pass a driver's safety evaluation, however, occasionally patients surprise me by improving enough over 9 to 12 months that they are able to pass such a test.  I would certainly be happy to recommend such a test if I believe ,Mr. A is likely to pass it and he is always welcome to enroll in a driver's safety program without my recommendation, however, I think it is exceeding unlikely that he has the capability of passing this rigorous test at this time.  I also think it is quite likely he will not regain sufficient speed of motion to pass such a test.",

176,322,4453, Dietary consultation for weight reduction secondary to diabetes., Consult - History and Phy.,3.0, Dietary Consultation - 2 ,"SUBJECTIVE:,  This is a 54-year-old female who comes for dietary consultation for weight reduction secondary to diabetes.  She did attend diabetes education classes at Abc Clinic.  She comes however, wanting to really work at weight reduction.  She indicates that she has been on the Atkins' diet for about two years and lost about ten pounds.  She is now following a veggie diet which she learned about in Poland originally.  She has been on it for three weeks and intends to follow it for another three weeks.  This does not allow any fruits or grains or starchy vegetables or meats.  She does eat nuts for protein.  She is wanting to know if she is at risk of having a severe low blood sugar reaction in this form of diet.  She also wants to know that if she gets skinny enough, if the diabetes will go away.  Her problem time, blood sugar wise, is in the morning.  She states that if she eats too much in the evening that her blood sugars are always higher the next morning.,OBJECTIVE:,  Weight:  189 pounds.  Reported height:  5 feet 5 inches.  BMI is approximately 31-1/2.  Diabetes medications include metformin 500 mg daily.  Lab from 5/12/04:  Hemoglobin A1C was 6.4%.,A diet history was obtained.  I instructed the patient on dietary guidelines for weight reduction.  A 1200-calorie meal plan was recommended.,ASSESSMENT:,  Patient's diet history reflects that she is highly restricting carbohydrates in her food intake.  She does not have blood sugar records with her for me to review, but we discussed strategies for improving blood sugar control in the morning.  This primarily included a recommendation of including some solid protein with her bedtime snack which could be done in the form of nuts.  She is doing some physical activity two to three times a week.  This includes aerobic walking with weights on her arms and her ankles.  She is likely going to need to increase frequency in this area to help support weight reduction.  Her basal metabolic rate was estimated at 1415 calories a day.  Her total calorie requirements for weight maintenance are estimated at 1881 calories a day.  A 1200-calorie meal plan should support a weight loss of at least one pound a week.,PLAN:,  Recommend patient increase the frequency of her walking to five days a week.  Encouraged a 30-minute duration.  Also recommend patient include some solid protein with her bedtime snack to help address fasting blood sugar elevations.  And lastly, I encouraged caloric intake of just under 1200 calories daily.  Recommend keeping food records and tracking caloric intake.  It is unlikely that her blood sugars would drop significantly low on the current dose of Glucophage.  However, I encouraged her to be careful not to reduce calories below 1000 calories daily.  She may want to consider a multivitamin as well.  This was a one-hour consultation.","consult - history and phy., consultation, atkins' diet, blood sugar reaction, diabetes, diabetes education, diabetes education classes, diet history, dietary consultation, dietary guidelines, meal plan, protein, veggie diet, weight reduction, caloric intake, blood sugar, reduction, sugar, calories, blood, dietary, weight,"

At this time, she is being treated aggressively with mechanical ventilation and other supportive measures and has developed disseminated intravascular coagulation with prolonged partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, low fibrinogen, and elevated D-dimer.  At this time, I am being consulted for further evaluation and recommendations for treatment.  The nurses report that she has actually improved clinically over the last 24 hours.  Bleeding has been a problem; however, it seems to have been abrogated at this time with factor replacement as well as platelet infusion.  There is no prior history of coagulopathy.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,Otherwise nondescript as is the past surgical history.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,There were possible illicit drugs.

There was some oozing around the site of her central line.,EXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  There is no evidence of compromise arterial blood flow at the digits or of her hands or feet.,LABORATORY STUDIES:  ,The DIC parameters with a platelet count of approximately 50,000, INR of 2.4, normal PTT at this time, fibrinogen of 200, and a D-dimer of 13.,IMPRESSION/PLAN:  ,At this time is disseminated intravascular coagulation from sepsis from pneumococcal disease.  My recommendation for the patient is to continue factor replacement as you are.  It seems that her clinical course is reversing and simple factor replacement is probably is the best measure at this time.  There is no indication at this point for Xigris.  However, if her coagulopathy does not resolve within the next 24 hours and continue to improve with an elevated fibrinogen, normalization of her coagulation times, I would consider low-dose continuous infusion heparin for abrogation of consumption of coagulation routines and continued supportive infusions.  I will repeat her laboratory studies in the morning and give more recommendations at that time.","consult - history and phy., intravascular, coagulation, pneumonia, thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, disseminated intravascular coagulation, streptococcal pneumonia, intravascular coagulation, infusion, coagulopathy, fibrinogen, respiratory, oropharynx, sepsis, disseminated, "

The patient states that her husband has been diagnosed with high blood cholesterol as well.  She wants some support with some dietary recommendations to assist both of them in healthier eating.  The two of them live alone now, and she is used to cooking for large portions.  She is having a hard time adjusting to preparing food for the two of them.  She would like to do less food preparation, in fact.  She is starting a new job this week.,OBJECTIVE:,  Her reported height is 5 feet 4 inches.  Today‚Äôs weight was 170 pounds.  BMI is approximately 29.  A diet history was obtained.  I instructed the patient on a 1200 calorie meal plan emphasizing low-saturated fat sources with moderate amounts of sodium as well.  Information on fast food eating was supplied, and additional information on low-fat eating was also supplied.,ASSESSMENT:,  The patient‚Äôs basal energy expenditure is estimated at 1361 calories a day.  Her total calorie requirement for weight maintenance is estimated at 1759 calories a day.  Her diet history reflects that she is making some very healthy food choices on a regular basis.  She does emphasize a lot of fruits and vegetables, trying to get a fruit or a vegetable or both at most meals.  She also is emphasizing lower fat selections.  Her physical activity level is moderate at this time.  She is currently walking for 20 minutes four or five days out of the week but at a very moderate pace with a friend.  We reviewed the efforts at weight reduction identifying 3500 calories in a pound of body fat and the need to gradually and slowly chip away at this number on a long-term basis for weight reduction.  We discussed the need to reduce calories from what her current patterns are and to hopefully increase physical activity slightly as well.  We discussed menu selection, as well as food preparation techniques.  The patient appears to have been influenced by the current low-carb, high-protein craze and had really limited her food selections based on that.  I was able to give her some more room for variety including some moderate portions of potatoes, pasta and even on occasion breading her meat as long as she prepares it in a low-fat fashion which was discussed.,PLAN:,  Recommend the patient increase the intensity and the duration of her physical activity with a goal of 30 minutes five days a week working at a brisk walk.  Recommend the patient reduce calories by 500 daily to support a weight loss of one pound a week.  This translates into a 1200-calorie meal plan.  I encouraged the patient to keep food records in order to better track calories consumed.  I recommended low fat selections and especially those that are lower in saturated fats.  Emphasis would be placed on moderating portions of meat and having more moderate snacks between meals as well.  This was a one-hour consultation.  I provided my name and number should additional needs arise.","consult - history and phy., hyperlipidemia, hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease, weight reduction, dietary recommendations, healthier eating, meal plan, dietary consultation, low fat, physical activity, weight, gastroesophageal, dietary, calories, food"

Her total calorie requirements, including a physical activity factor as well as additional calories for pregnancy, totals to 2036 calories per day.  Her diet history reveals that she has somewhat irregular eating patterns.  In the last 24 hours when she was working at Wal-Mart, she ate at 5 a.m. but did not eat anything prior to that since starting work at 10 p.m.  We discussed the need for small frequent eating.  We identified carbohydrate as the food source that contributes to the blood glucose response.  We identified carbohydrate sources in the food supply, recognizing that they are all good for her.  The only carbohydrates she was asked to entirely avoid would be the concentrated forms of refined sugars.  In regard to use of her traditional foods of rice, I pulled out a one-third cup measuring cup to identify a 15-gram equivalent of rice.  We discussed the need for moderating the portion of carbohydrates consumed at one given time.  Emphasis was placed at eating with a high frequency with a goal of eating every two to four hours over the course of the day when she is awake.  Her weight loss was discouraged.  Patient was encouraged to eat more generously but with attention to the amount of carbohydrates consumed at a time.,PLAN:,  The meal plan provided has a carbohydrate content that represents 40 percent of a 2000-calorie meal plan.  The meal plan was devised to distribute her carbohydrates more evenly throughout the day.  The meal plan was meant to reflect an example for her eating, while the patient was encouraged to eat according to appetite and not to go without eating for long periods of time.  The meal plan is as follows:  breakfast 2 carbohydrate servings, snack 1 carbohydrate serving, lunch 2-3 carbohydrate servings, snack 1 carbohydrate serving, dinner 2-3 carbohydrate servings, bedtime snack 1-2 carbohydrate servings.  Recommend patient include a solid protein with each of her meals as well as with her snack that occurs before going to sleep.  Encouraged adequate rest.  Also recommend adequate calories to sustain weight gain of one-half to one pound per week.  If the meal plan reflected does not support slow gradual weight gain, then we will need to add more foods accordingly.  This was a one-hour consultation.  I provided my name and number should additional needs arise.","consult - history and phy., blood sugars, fatigued, total calorie, carbohydrate content, consultation for gestational diabetes, dietary consultation, weight gain, gestational diabetes, carbohydrate servings, meal planning, meals, weight, carbohydrate, dietary, servings, planning"
180,326,4457, Dietary consultation for a woman with polycystic ovarian syndrome and hyperlipidemia., Consult - History and Phy.,3.0, Dietary Consultation - 1 ,"SUBJECTIVE:,  This is a followup dietary consultation for polycystic ovarian syndrome and hyperlipidemia.  The patient reports that she has resumed food record keeping which she feels like it has given her greater control.  Her physical activity level has remained high.  Her struggle times are in the mid-afternoon if she has not had enough food to eat, as well as in the evening after dinner.,OBJECTIVE:, Vital Signs:  Weight is 189-1/2 pounds.  Food records were reviewed,ASSESSMENT:,  The patient has experienced a weight loss of 1-1/2 pounds in the last month.  She is commended for these efforts.  We have reviewed food records identifying that she has done a nice job keeping a calorie count for the last two or three weeks.  We discussed the value of this and how it was very difficulty to resume it, however, after she suspended the record keeping.  We also discussed its reflection that she is not getting very many fruits and vegetables on a regular basis.  We identified some ways of preventing her from feeling sluggish and having problems with low blood sugar in the middle of the afternoon by routinely planning an afternoon snack that can prevent these symptoms.  This will likely be around 2:30 or 3 p.m. for her.  We also discussed strategies for evening snacking to help put some definition and boundaries to the snacking.,PLAN:,  I recommended the patient routinely include an afternoon snack around 2:30 to 3 p.m.  It will be helpful if this snack includes some protein such as nuts or low-fat cheese.  She is also encouraged to continue with her record keeping for food choices and calorie points.  I also recommended she maintain her high level of physical activity.  Will plan to follow the patient in one month for ongoing support.  This was a 30-minute consultation.","consult - history and phy., dietary consultation, calorie count, calorie points, consultation, food choices, food record, hyperlipidemia, low-fat cheese, many fruits and vegetables, physical activity, polycystic ovarian syndrome, snack, dietary, polycystic, food, afternoon"
181,327,4458," Followup dietary consultation for hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and possible metabolic syndrome", Consult - History and Phy.,3.0, Dietary Consult - Hyperlipidemia ,"SUBJECTIVE:,  This is a followup dietary consultation for hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and possible metabolic syndrome.  The patient reports that she has worked hard for a number of weeks following the meal plan prescribed, but felt like she was gaining weight and not losing weight on it.  She is not sure that she was following it accurately.  She is trying to walk 1-1/2 to 2 miles every other day, but is increasing her time in the garden and doing other yard work as well.  Once she started experiencing some weight gain, she went back to her old South Beach Diet and felt like she was able to take some of that weight off.  However she realizes that the South Beach Diet is not a healthy diet for her and so is coming back for better instruction on safe weight loss and low-fat eating.,OBJECTIVE:,  Weight is 275 pounds.  Food records were reviewed.,ASSESSMENT:,  The patient experienced a weight gain of 2 pounds since our last consultation which was two months ago.  I did carefully review her food records and evaluated calories consumed.  While she was carefully tracking the volume of protein and carbohydrates, she was getting some excess calories from the fatty proteins selected.  Thus we rearranged her meal plan a little bit and talked about how to track her fat calories as well.  She was more open to reducing the amount of protein from the previous meal plan and increasing slightly the amount of carbohydrates.  While this still is not as much carbohydrate as I would normally recommend, I am certainly willing to work with her on how she feels her body best handles weight reduction.  We also discussed a snack that could be eliminated in the morning because she really is not hungry at that time.,PLAN:,  A new 1500 calorie meal plan was developed based on 35% of the calories coming from protein, 40% of the calories from carbohydrate, and 25% of the calories from fat.  This translates in to 10 servings at 15 grams a piece of carbohydrates throughout the day dividing them in to groups of two servings per meal and per snack.  This also translates in to 2 ounces of protein at breakfast, 6 ounces at lunch, 2 ounces in the afternoon snack, 6 ounces at supper, and 2 ounces in the evening snack.  We have eliminated the morning snack.  The patient will now track the grams of fat in her meats as well as added fats.  Her goal for total fats over the course of the day is no more than 42 grams of fat per day.  This was a half hour consultation.  We will plan to see the patient back in one month for support.","consult - history and phy., hyperlipidemia, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, meal, food records, south beach diet, dietary consultation, meal plan, carbohydrates, snack, dietary, calories, weight"

Her diet history reveals that she is eating three meals a day and three snacks.  The snacks were just added last week following presence of ketones in her urine.  We identified carbohydrate sources in the food supply, recognizing that they are the foods that raise blood sugar the most.  We identified 15 gram equivalents of carbohydrate and established a carbohydrate budget.  We also discussed the goal of balancing food intake with blood sugar control and adequate caloric intake to sustain appropriate weight gain for the pregnancy of 1/2 a pound a week through the duration of the pregnancy.  We discussed the physiology of ketone production from inadequate calories or inadequate insulin and elevated blood sugars.  While a sample meal plan was provided reflecting the patient‚Äôs carbohydrate budget I emphasized the need for her to eat according to her appetite, but to work at consistency in the volume of carbohydrates consumed at a given meal or a given snack from day to day.  Patient was assured that we can titrate the insulin to match whatever eating pattern is suitable for her as long as she can do it on a consistent basis.  At the same time she was encouraged to continue to eliminate the more concentrated forms of refined carbohydrates.,PLAN:,  Recommend the patient work with the following meal plan with a carbohydrate budget representing approximately 45% of the calories from carbohydrate.

The intraocular pressure in the mid-to-high teens in the left eye is probably high for her.  She has allergic reaction to Cosopt.  I will recommend starting Xalatan OS nightly.  I think the intraocular pressure in the right eye is acceptable and is probably a stable pressure for her OD.  She will need followup in the next 1 or 2 months after returning home to Israel later this week after starting the new medication which is Xalatan.,Regarding the macular degeneration, she has had high-risk changes in both eyes.  The vision in the right eye is good, but she does have a very concerning area of RPE atrophy just adjacent to the fovea of the right eye.  I strongly recommend that she see a retina specialist before returning to Israel in order to fully discuss prophylactic measures to prevent worsening of her macular degeneration in the right eye.","consult - history and phy., cataract extraction, lens implants, decreased vision, macular degeneration, intraocular pressures, rpe atrophy, eye, degeneration, glaucoma, macular, vision, "

192,338,4470, The patient was referred after he was hospitalized for what eventually was diagnosed as a conversion disorder. , Consult - History and Phy.,3.0, Conversion Disorder ,"REASON FOR REFERRAL:  ,The patient was referred to me by Dr. X of Children's Hospital after he was hospitalized for what eventually was diagnosed as a conversion disorder.  I had met the patient and his mother in the hospital and had begun getting information regarding his symptoms and background at that time.  After his discharge, the patient was scheduled to see me for followup services.  This was a 90-minute intake that was completed on 10/10/2007 with the patient's mother.  I reviewed with her the treatment consent form as well as the boundaries of confidentiality, and she stated that she understood these concepts.,PRESENTING PROBLEMS:,  Please see the inpatient hospital progress note contained in his chart for additional background information.  The patient's mother reported that he continues with his conversion episodes.  She noted that they are occurring approximately 6 times a day.  They consist primarily of tremors, arching his back, and, by her report, doing some gang signs during the episode.  She reported that the conversion reactions had decreased after his hospitalization, and he had none for 3 days, but then, they began picking up again.  From information gathered from mother, it would suggest that she frequently does ""status checks,"" where she asks him how he is doing, and that after she began checking on him more that he began having more conversion reactions.  In terms of what she does when he has a conversion reaction, she reported that primarily that she tries to keep him safe.  She puts a sheath under him because the carpeting is dirty.  She removes any furniture, she wraps his legs together so they do not knock together, she sits with him and she gives him attention and says ""calm down, breathe"" and after it is over, she continues to tell him to be calm and to breathe.  She denied that she gives them any more attention.  I strongly encouraged her to stop doing status checks, as this likely is reinforcing the behavior.  I also noted that while he certainly needs to be kept safe, that she does not want to give a lot of attention to this behavior, and that over time we will teach him ways of coping with this independently.  In regards to his mood, she reported that his mood is quite good.  She denied any sadness or irritability.  She denied anhedonia.  She reports that he is a little bit hard to get up in the morning.  He is going to bed at about 11, getting up at 8 or 9.  No changes in weight or eating were noted.  No changes in concentration, suicidal ideation, and any suicidal history was denied.  She denied symptoms of anxiety, although she did note that she thought he worried a little about going to school and some financial stress.  Other symptoms of psychopathology were denied.,DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY: , The patient was reportedly a 7 pounds 12 ounces product of an unplanned and uncomplicated pregnancy and planned cesarean delivery.  Mother reported that she did receive prenatal care.  The use of alcohol, drugs, or tobacco during the pregnancy were denied.  She denied that he had any feeding or sleeping problems in the perinatal period.  She described him as a fussy and active baby, but he was described as a cuddly baby.  She noted that the pediatricians never expressed any concerns regarding his developmental milestones.  SHE REPORTED THAT HE IS ALLERGIC TO PENICILLIN.  Serious injures or toileting problems were denied as were a history of seizures.,FAMILY BACKGROUND: , The patient currently lives with his mother who is age 57 and with her partner who is age 40.  They have been together since 1994, and he is the only father figure that the patient has even known.  The father was previously in a relationship that resulted in an 11-year-old daughter who visits the patient's home every other weekend.  The patient's father's whereabouts are unknown.  There is no information on his family.  Mother stated that he discontinued his involvement in her life when she was about 3 months pregnant with the patient, and the patient has never met him.  As noted, there is no information on the paternal side of the family.  In terms of the mother's side of family, the maternal grandfather died in his 60s due to what mother described as ""hardening of the arteries,"" and the maternal grandmother died in 2003 due to stroke.  There were 4 maternal aunts, one of them died at age 9 months from pneumonia, one of them died at 19 years old from what was described as a brain tumor, and there are 3 maternal uncles.  In terms of family relationships, it was reported that overall the patient tends to get along fairly well with his parents, who reported that the patient and her partner tend to compete for mother's attention, and she noted this is difficult at times.  She reported that the patient and her partner do not really do anything together.  Mother reported that there is no domestic violence in the home, but there is some marital conflict, and this is may be difficult for The patient, as it is carried on in Spanish, and he does not speak Spanish.  There also is some stress in the home due to the stepdaughter, as there are some concerns that her mother may be involved in drugs.  The mother reported that she attended high school, did not attend any college.  She denied learning problems.  She denied psychological problems or any drug/alcohol history.  In terms of the biological father, she reported he did not graduate from high school.  She did not know of learning problems, psychological problems.  She denied that he had a drug/alcohol history.  There is a family history of alcoholism in one of the maternal uncles as well as in the maternal grandfather.  It should be noted that the patient and his family live in a small 4-bedroom apartment, where privacy is very difficult.,SOCIAL BACKGROUND:,  She reported that the patient is able to make and keep friends, but he enjoys lifting weights, skateboarding, and that he recently had an opportunity to do rock climbing, he really enjoyed that.  I encouraged her to have him involved in physical activity, as this is good for discharge the stress, to encourage the weightlifting, as well as the skateboarding.  Mother is going to check further information regarding the rock climbing that the patient had been involved in, which was at it sounds like by her description as some sort of boys' and girls' type of club.  Abuse of drugs or alcohol were denied.  The patient was not described as being sexually active.,ACADEMIC BACKGROUND: , The patient is currently in the 10th grade.  At present, he is on independent studies, which began after his hospitalization.  The mother reported that the teacher, who had come to school saw one of his episodes, and stated that, they would not want him to be attending school.  I spoke with her very clearly and directly regarding the fact that it was probably not best for the patient to be on independent studies, that he needed to be returned to his normal school environment.  He has never had an episode at school, and he needs to be back with his peers, back in a regular environment, where he is under normal expectations.  I spoke with her regarding my concerns, regarding the fact that he is unsupervised during the day, and we do not want this turning into one big long vacation, where he is not getting his work done, and he gets himself in trouble.  Normally, he would be attending at High School.  The mother stated that she would contact them as well as check into possibly a 504-Plan.  She reported that he really does not to go back to High School.  He says, the ""kids are bad;"" however, she denied that he has any history of fighting.  She noted that he is stressed by the school, there have been some peer problems, possibly some bullying.  I noted these need to be addressed with the school, as she had not done so.  She stated that she would speak with a counselor.  She noted, however, that he has a history of not liking school and avoiding going to school.  She noted that he is somewhat behind in his work due to the hospitalization.  His grades traditionally are C's.  She denied any Special Education Services.,PREVIOUS COUNSELING: , Denied.,DIAGNOSTIC SUMMARY AND IMPRESSION: , Similar to my impression at the hospital, it would appear that the patient clearly qualifies for a diagnosis of conversion disorder.  It appears that there are multiple stressors in the family, and that the mother is reinforcing his conversion reaction.  I am also very concerned regarding the fact that he is not attending school and want him back in the normal school environment as quickly as possible.  My plan is to meet the patient at the next session to update the information regarding his functioning and to begin to teach him skills for reducing his stress and relaxing.,DSM-IV DIAGNOSES:  ,AXIS I:  Conversion disorder (300.11).,AXIS II:  No diagnosis (V71.09).,AXIS III:  No diagnosis.,AXIS IV:  Problems with primary support group, educational problems, and peer problems.,AXIS V:  Global Assessment of Functioning equals 60.","consult - history and phy., developmental history, academic background, global assessment of functioning, normal school environment, conversion reactions, conversion disorder, conversion, background, environment, peers, disorder, axis,"

The patient was unaware of his diagnosis; therefore, we discussed that with him today in clinic.  The patient also complains of the development of an incisional hernia since his surgery in November.  He was seen back by Dr. X in April 2008 and hopes that Dr. X may reverse his colostomy and repair his hernia since he did his initial surgery, but because the patient has lost his job and has no insurance, he was referred to our clinic by Dr. X.  Currently, the patient does state that his hernia bothers him more so than his colostomy, and if it were not for the hernia then he may just refrain from having his colostomy reversed; however, the hernia has grown in size and causing him significant discomfort.

I have asked the patient to return to High Point Regional and get his medical records including the operative note and pathology results from his initial surgery so that I would have a better idea of what was done during his initial surgery.  He stated that he would try and do this and bring the records to our clinic on his next appointment.  I have also set him up for a barium enema to study the rectal stump.  He will return to us in two weeks at which time we will review his radiological studies and his medical records from the outside hospital and determine the best course of action from that point.  This was discussed with the patient as well as his sister and significant other in the clinic today.  They were in agreement with this plan.  We also called the social worker to come and help the patient get more ostomy appliances, as he stated that he had no more and he was having to reuse the existing ostomy bag.

198,344,4483, Consult for prostate cancer, Consult - History and Phy.,3.0, Consult - Prostate Cancer ,"CONSULT FOR PROSTATE CANCER,The patient returned for consultation for his newly diagnosed prostate cancer.  The options including radical prostatectomy with or without nerve sparing were discussed with him with the risks of bleeding, infection, rectal injury, impotence, and incontinence.  These were discussed at length.  Alternative therapies including radiation therapy; either radioactive seed placement, conformal radiation therapy, or the HDR radiation treatments were discussed with the risks of bladder, bowel, and rectal injury and possible impotence were discussed also.  There is a risk of rectal fistula.  Hormonal therapy is usually added to the radiation therapy options and this has the risk of osteoporosis, gynecomastia, hot flashes and impotency.  Potency may not recover after the hormone therapy has been completed.  Cryosurgery was discussed with the risks of urinary retention, stricture formation, incontinence and impotency.  There is a risk of rectal fistula.  He would need to have a suprapubic catheter for about two weeks and may need to learn self-intermittent catheterization if he cannot void adequately.  Prostate surgery to relieve obstruction and retention after radioactive seeds or cryosurgery has a higher risk of urinary incontinence.  Observation therapy was discussed with him in addition.  I answered all questions that were put to me and I think he understands the options that are available.  I spoke with the patient for over 60 minutes concerning these options.","consult - history and phy., prostate cancer, cryosurgery, hdr radiation, prostate surgery, bladder, bleeding, bowel, consultation, impotence, incontinence, infection, prostatectomy, radiation therapy, radical, rectal, rectal fistula, rectal injury, prostate cancer consult, cancer, radiation, prostateNOTE,: Thesetranscribed medical transcription sample reports and examples are provided by various users andare for reference purpose only.
