The patient states that in November 2007, he presented to High Point Regional Hospital with sharp left lower quadrant pain and was emergently taken to Surgery where he woke up with a ""bag.""  According to some notes that were faxed to our office from the surgeon in High Point who performed his initial surgery, Dr. X, the patient had diverticulitis with perforated sigmoid colon, and underwent a sigmoid colectomy with end colostomy and Hartmann's pouch.  The patient was unaware of his diagnosis; therefore, we discussed that with him today in clinic.  The patient also complains of the development of an incisional hernia since his surgery in November.  He was seen back by Dr. X in April 2008 and hopes that Dr. X may reverse his colostomy and repair his hernia since he did his initial surgery, but because the patient has lost his job and has no insurance, he was referred to our clinic by Dr. X.  Currently, the patient does state that his hernia bothers him more so than his colostomy, and if it were not for the hernia then he may just refrain from having his colostomy reversed; however, the hernia has grown in size and causing him significant discomfort.  He feels that he always has to hold his hand over the hernia to prevent it from prolapsing and causing him even more discomfort.,PAST MEDICAL AND SURGICAL HISTORY:,1.

The patient presents for reversal of his colostomy as well as repair of his incisional hernia.  I have asked the patient to return to High Point Regional and get his medical records including the operative note and pathology results from his initial surgery so that I would have a better idea of what was done during his initial surgery.  He stated that he would try and do this and bring the records to our clinic on his next appointment.  I have also set him up for a barium enema to study the rectal stump.  He will return to us in two weeks at which time we will review his radiological studies and his medical records from the outside hospital and determine the best course of action from that point.  This was discussed with the patient as well as his sister and significant other in the clinic today.  They were in agreement with this plan.  We also called the social worker to come and help the patient get more ostomy appliances, as he stated that he had no more and he was having to reuse the existing ostomy bag.  To my understanding, his social worker, as well as the ostomy nurses were able to get him some assistance with this.,",

Surgically she has had a stomach operation for ulcer disease back in 1974, she says.  She does not know exactly what was done.  It was done at a hospital in California which she says no longer exists.  This makes it difficult to find out exactly what she had done.  She also had her gallbladder and appendix taken out in the 1970s at the same hospital.  Medically she has no significant problems and no true medical illnesses.

", General Medicine,3, Pain from Hernia - ER Consult ,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,This is a 53-year-old man, who presented to emergency room with multiple complaints including pain from his hernia, some question of blood in his stool, nausea, and vomiting, and also left lower extremity pain.  At the time of my exam, he states that his left lower extremity pain has improved considerably.  He apparently had more significant paresthesias in the past and now he feels that the paresthesias have improved considerably.  He does have a history of multiple medical problems including atrial fibrillation, he is on Coumadin, which is currently subtherapeutic, multiple CVAs in the past, peripheral vascular disease, and congestive heart failure.  He has multiple chronic history of previous ischemia of his large bowel in the past.,PHYSICAL EXAM,VITAL SIGNS:  Currently his temperature is 98.2, pulse is 95, and blood pressure is 138/98.,HEENT:  Unremarkable.,LUNGS:  Clear.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  An irregular rhythm.,ABDOMEN:  Soft.,EXTREMITIES:  His upper extremities are well perfused.  He has palpable radial and femoral pulses.  He does not have any palpable pedal pulses in either right or left lower extremity.  He does have reasonable capillary refill in both feet.  He has about one second capillary refill on both the right hand and left lower extremities and his left foot is perhaps little cool, but it is relatively warm.  Apparently, this was lot worst few hours ago.  He describes significant pain and pallor, which he feels has improved and certainly clinically at this point does not appear to be as significant.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN: , This gentleman with a history of multiple comorbidities as detailed above had what sounds clinically like acute exacerbation of chronic peripheral vascular disease, essentially related to spasm versus a small clot, which may have been lysed to some extent.  He currently has a viable extremity and viable foot, but certainly has significant making compromised flow.  It is unclear to me whether this is chronic or acute, and whether he is a candidate for any type of intervention.  He certainly would benefit from an angiogram to better to define his anatomy and anticoagulation in the meantime.  Given his potential history of recent lower GI bleeding, he has been evaluated by GI to see whether or not he is a candidate for heparinization.  We will order an angiogram for the next few hours and followup on those results to better define his anatomy and to determine whether or not if any interventions are appropriate.  Again, at this point, he has no pain, relatively rapid capillary refill, and relatively normal motor function suggesting a viable extremity.  We will follow him along closely.","general medicine, blood in stool, nausea, capillary refill, angiogram, hernia, extremity, "

57,233,3273," Patient with Hypertension, atrial fibrillation, large cardioembolic stroke initially to the right brain requesting medical management", General Medicine,1, Medical Management Consult Request ,"CONSULT REQUEST FOR:, Medical management.,The patient has been in special procedures now for over 2 hours and I am unable to examine.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:, Obtained from Dr. A on an 81-year-old white female, who is right handed, who by history, had a large stroke to the right brain, causing left body findings, last night. She was unfortunately outside of the window for emergent treatment and had a negative CT scan of the head. Was started on protocol medication and that is similar to TPA, which is an investigational study.,During the evaluation she was found to be in atrial fibrillation on admission with hypertension that was treated with labetalol en route. Her heart rate was 130. She was brought down with Cardizem. She received the study drug in the night and about an hour later thought to have another large stroke effecting the opposite side of the brain, that the doctors and company think is probably cardioembolic and not related to the study drug, as TPA has no obvious known association with this.,At that time the patient became comatose and required emergent intubation and paralyzation. Her diastolic at that time rose up to 190, likely the result of the acute second stroke. She is currently in arteriogram and a clot has been extracted from the proximal left carotid, but there is still distal clot that they are working on. Dr. A has updated the family to her extremely guarded and critical prognosis.,At present, it is not known yet, we do not have the STAT echocardiogram, if she has a large clot in the heart or if she could have a patent foramen ovale clot in the legs that has been passed to the heart. Echo that is pending, and cannot be done till the patient is out of arteriogram, which is her lifesaving procedure right now.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:, Complete review of systems is unobtainable at present. From what I can tell, is that she is scheduled for an upcoming bladder distension surgery and I do not know if this is why she is off Coumadin for chronic AFib or what, at this point.

Currently do not have any available vital signs or physical exam, as I cannot get to the patient.,LABORATORY: ,Reviewed and are remarkable for white count of 13 with 76 neutrophils. BMP is normal, except for a blood sugar of 157, hemoglobin A1c is pending. TSH 2.1, cholesterol 165, Digoxin 1.24, CPK 57. ABG 7.47/32/459 on 100%. Magnesium 1.5.

Chest x-ray has good ET tube placement. She has mild cardiomegaly. Some mild interstitial opacities consistent with OGD and minimal amount of atherosclerosis of the aorta.,CT scan of the head: I do not see any active bleeding.,X-rays of the shoulders appear intact to me and we are awaiting radiologies final approval on those.,ASSESSMENT/PLAN/PROBLEMS:,1. Large cardioembolic stroke initially to the right brain, with devastating effects, and now stroke into the left brain as well, with fluctuating mental status. Obviously she is in critical condition and stable with multiple strokes. One must also wonder if she could have a large clot burden below the heart and patent foramen ovale, etc. We need STAT records from her prior cardiologist and prior echocardiogram report to see exactly what are the details. I have ordered a STAT echo and to have the group that sees her read it, that if he has a large clot burdened in the heart or has distal clot with a PFO we may be able to better prognosticate at this point. Obviously, she cannot have any anticoagulants, except for the study drug, at present, which is her only chance and hopefully they will be able to retrieve most of the clot with emergency retrieval device as activated heroically, by Dr. A and interventional radiology.,2. Hypertension/atrial fibrillation: This will be a difficult management and the fact that she has been on a beta-blocker for Parkinson's, she may have withdrawal to the beta-blockers as we remove this. Given her atrial fibrillation, I do agree the safest agent right now is to use a Cardizem drip as needed and would use it for systolic greater than 160 to 180, or diastolics greater than 90 to 100. Also, would use it to control the atrial fibrillation. We would, however, be very cautious not to put her in heart block with the Digoxin and the beta-blocker on board. Weighing all risks and benefits, I think that given the fact that she has a beta-blocker on board and Digoxin, we would like to avoid the beta-blocker for vasospasm protection and will favor using calcium channel blocker for now. If, however, we run into trouble with this, I would prefer to switch her to Brevibloc or an Esmolol drip and see how she does, as she may withdraw from the beta-blocker. I will be watching this closely and managing the hypertension as I see fit at the moment, based on all factors. Will also ask cardiology if she has one that sees her here, to help guide this. Her Digoxin level is appropriate, as well as a TSH. I do not feel that we need to work this up further, other than the STAT echo and ultrasound of the leg.,3. Respiratory failure requiring ventilator: I have discussed this with Dr. Devlin, we do not feel the need to hyperventilate her at present. We will keep her comfortable on the breathing machine and try to keep her pH in a normal range, around 7.4, and her CO2 in the 30 to 40 range. If she has brain swelling, we will need to hyperventilate her to a pCO2 of 30 and a pH of 7.5, to optimize the cardiac arrhythmia potential of alkalosis weighed with the control of brain swelling.,4. Optimize electrolytes as you can.,5. Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis for now, with thigh-high TED hose, possibly SCDs, although I do not have experience with the vampire/venom to know if we need to worry about DIC which the SCDs may worsen. Will follow daily CBCs for that.,6. Nutrition: Will go ahead and start a low dose of tube feeds and hope that she does survive.,I will defer all updates to the family for the next 24 to 48 hours to Dr. Devlin's expertise, given her unknown and fluctuating neurologic prognosis.,Thank you so much for allowing us to participate in her care. We will be happy to do all medication treatment until the point that I feel that I would need any help from critical care. I believe that we will be able to manage her fully at this point, for simplicity sake.",

He once again developed gross hematuria, which was unprovoked.  His Coumadin has been held.  The patient has known BPH and is on Flomax.  He is being treated with Coumadin because of atrial fibrillation and stroke.  This is the second time he has had significant gross hematuria this month.  He also fell about a week ago and is complaining of buttock pain and leg pain.  We did get x-rays of hips, knees, and ankles.  Clearly, he has significant degenerative disease in all these areas.  No fractures noted however.  He felt that the pain is pretty severe and particularly worse in the morning.  His sinuses are bothering him.  He wonders about getting some nasal saline spray.  We talked about Coumadin, stroke risk, etc. in the setting of atrial fibrillation.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , Vitals:  As in chart.  The patient is alert, pleasant, and cooperative.  He is not in any apparent distress.  He is comfortable in a seated position.  I did not examine him further today.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:,1.  Hematuria.  Coumadin needs to be stopped, so we will evaluate what is going on, which is probably just some BPH.  We will also obtain a repeat UA as he did describe to me some dysuria.  However, I do not think this would account for the gross hematuria.  He will be started on an aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily.,2.  For the pain we will try him on Lortab.  He will get a Lortab everyday in the morning 5/500 prior to getting out of bed, and then he will have the option of having a few more throughout the day if he requires it.,3.

She actually turns 90 later this month, seen today for a short-term followup.  Actually, the main reasons we are seeing her back so soon which are elevated blood pressure and her right arm symptoms are basically resolved.  Blood pressure is better even though she is not currently on the higher dose Mavik likely recommended.  She apparently did not feel well with the higher dose, so she just went back to her previous dose of 1 mg daily.  She thinks, she also has an element of office hypertension.  Also, since she is on Mavik plus verapamil, she could switch over to the combined drug Tarka.  However, when we gave her samples of that she thought they were too big for her to swallow.  Basically, she is just back on her previous blood pressure regimen.  However, her blood pressure seems to be better today.  Her daughter says that they do check it periodically and it is similar to today‚Äôs reading.  Her right arm symptoms are basically resolved and she attributed that to her muscle problem back in the right shoulder blade.  We did do a C-spine and right shoulder x-ray and those just mainly showed some degenerative changes and possibly some rotator cuff injury with the humeral head quite high up in the glenoid in the right shoulder, but this does not seem to cause her any problems.  She has some vague ‚Äústomach problems‚Äù, although apparently it is improved when she stopped Aleve and she does not have any more aches or pains off Aleve.  She takes Tylenol p.r.n., which seems to be enough for her.  She does not think she has any acid reflux symptoms or heartburn.  She does take Tums t.i.d. and also Mylanta at night.  She has had dentures for many, many years and just recently I guess in the last few months, although she was somewhat vague on this, she has had some sores in her mouth.  They do heal up, but then she will get another one.  She also thinks since she has been on the Lexapro, she has somewhat of a tremor of her basically whole body at least upper body including the torso and arms and had all of the daughters who I not noticed to speak of and it is certainly difficult to tell her today that she has much tremor.  They do think the Lexapro has helped to some extent.,ALLERGIES: , None.,MEDICATION: , Verapamil 240 mg a day, Mavik 1 mg a day, Lipitor 10 mg one and half daily, vitamins daily, Ocuvite daily, Tums t.i.d., Tylenol 2-3 daily p.r.n., and Mylanta at night.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  Mostly otherwise as above.,OBJECTIVE:,General:  She is a pleasant elderly lady.

He appears genuine in his desire to embark on a substantial weight-lowering regime, and is going to do that through dietary control.  He knows what needs to be done with the absence of carbohydrates, and especially simple sugar.  He will also check a hemoglobin A1c, lipid profile, urine for microalbuminuria and a chem profile.  I will need to recheck him in a month to verify that his sugars and blood pressure have come into the ideal range.  He has allergic rhinitis for which Zyrtec can be used.,2.  He has irritable bowel syndrome.  We will use Metamucil for that which also should help stabilize the stools so that the irritation of the rectum is lessened.  For the bleeding I would like to obtain a sigmoidoscopy.  It is bright red blood.,3.  For his insomnia, I found there is very little in the way of medications that are going to fix that, however I have encouraged him in good sleep hygiene.  I will look forward to seeing him back in a month.  I will call him with the results of his lab.  His medications were made out.  We will use some Elocon cream for his seborrheic dermatitis of the face.  Zyrtec and Flonase for his allergic rhinitis.",

106,301,3193, Patient seen in Neuro-Oncology Clinic because of increasing questions about what to do next for his anaplastic astrocytoma., Hematology - Oncology,3, Anaplastic Astrocytoma - Letter ,"XYZ,RE:  ABC,MEDICAL RECORD#:  123,Dear Dr. XYZ:,I saw ABC back in Neuro-Oncology Clinic today.  He comes in for an urgent visit because of increasing questions about what to do next for his anaplastic astrocytoma.,Within the last several days, he has seen you in clinic and once again discussed whether or not to undergo radiation for his left temporal lesion.  The patient has clearly been extremely ambivalent about this therapy for reasons that are not immediately apparent.  It is clear that his MRI is progressing and that it seems unlikely at this time that anything other than radiation would be particularly effective.  Despite repeatedly emphasizing this; however, the patient still is worried about potential long-term side effects from treatment that frankly seem unwarranted at this particular time.,After seeing you in clinic, he and his friend again wanted to discuss possible changes in the chemotherapy regimen.  They came in with a list of eight possible agents that they would like to be administered within the next two weeks.  They then wanted another MRI to be performed and they were hoping that with the use of this type of approach, they might be able to induce another remission from which he can once again be spared radiation.,From my view, I noticed a man whose language has deteriorated in the week since I last saw him.  This is very worrisome.  Today, for the first time, I felt that there was a definite right facial droop as well.  Therefore, there is no doubt that he is becoming symptomatic from his growing tumor.  It suggests that he is approaching the end of his compliance curve and that the things may rapidly deteriorate in the near future.,Emphasizing this once again, in addition, to recommending steroids I once again tried to convince him to undergo radiation.  Despite an hour, this again amazingly was not possible.  It is not that he does not want treatment, however.  Because I told him that I did not feel it was ethical to just put him on the radical regimen that him and his friend devised, we compromised and elected to go back to Temodar in a low dose daily type regimen.  We would plan on giving 75 mg/sq m everyday for 21 days out of 28 days.  In addition, we will stop thalidomide 100 mg/day.  If he tolerates this for one week, we then agree that we would institute another one of the medications that he listed for us.  At this stage, we are thinking of using Accutane at that point.,While I am very uncomfortable with this type of approach, I think as long as he is going to be monitored closely that we may be able to get away with this for at least a reasonable interval.  In the spirit of compromise, he again consented to be evaluated by radiation and this time, seemed more resigned to the fact that it was going to happen sooner than later.  I will look at this as a positive sign because I think radiation is the one therapy from which he can get a reasonable response in the long term.,I will keep you apprised of followups.  If you have any questions or if I could be of any further assistance, feel free to contact me.,Sincerely,","hematology - oncology, neuro oncology, anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic, oncology, radiation, astrocytoma"

He does state on the date of injury, he was not doing anything additional.,TREATMENT HISTORY: , Thereafter, he developed shooting pain about the right upper extremity into his hand from his elbow down to the hand.  Any type of rotation and pulling muscle did cause numbness of the middle, ring, and small finger.  He was initially seen by Dr. X on October 18, 2007, at the Occupational Health Facility.  He utilized a tennis elbow brace, but did continue to experience symptomatology into the middle, ring, and small finger.  He was placed on light duty for the next couple of months.  Mr. XXXX suffered another work injury to the right shoulder on October 11, 2007.  He did undergo arthroscopic rotator cuff repair by Dr. Y in December of 2007.  Thereafter, he continued to work in a light duty type of basis for the next few months.,An EMG and nerve conduction study was performed in December of 2008, which demonstrated evidence of carpal tunnel syndrome.  He was able to return to work doing more of a light duty type of position.,The injured worker has also seen Dr. Y once again subsequent to the EMG and nerve conduction study on December 3, 2008.  It was felt that the injured worker would benefit from decompression of the carpal tunnel and an ulnar nerve transposition.  The injured worker subsequently was placed in a no work status thereafter.,At the present time, the injured worker does complain of light tingling into the small, ring, and middle finger.  There are times when the whole hand becomes very numb.  He does not use and do any type of lifting with regards to the right hand secondary to the discomfort.  His pain does vary between a 4 on a scale of 1 to 10.  He denies any weakness.  He does not awaken at night with the symptomatology.  Doing his job is the only causation as related to the carpal tunnel syndrome and the cubital tunnel type symptoms.  He does state that he is right-handed.,In addition, he does note numbness and tingling as related to the left hand.

I obtained her history from company medical records and performed an examination.  She is a 38-year-old laborer who states that she was injured on April 26, 2006, which according to the FROI (the injury occurred over a period of time from performing normal job processes such as putting bumpers on cars, gas caps and doors on cars).  She denies having any symptoms prior to the accident April 26, 2006.  She is right handed.  She used a tennis elbow brace, hand exercises, physical therapy, and Vicodin.  She received treatment from Dr. X and also Dr. Y,DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:,  June 27, 2006, EMG and nerve conduction velocity right upper extremity showed a moderate right carpal tunnel syndrome.  No evidence of a right cervical radiculopathy or ulnar neuropathy at the wrist or elbow.  January 29, 2007, EMG right upper extremity was normal and there was a normal nerve conduction velocity.  At the time of the examination, she complained of a constant pain in the olecranon and distal triceps with tingling in the right long, ring and small fingers, and night pain.  The pain was accentuated by gripping or opening the jar.  She is taking four Aleve a day and currently does not have any other treatment.,RECORDS REVIEWED: , Injury and illness incident report, US Healthworks records; Z physician review; Y office notes; X office notes who noted that on examination of the right elbow that the ulnar nerve subluxed with flexion and extension of the elbow.,EXAMINATION: , Examination of her right elbow revealed no measurable atrophy of the upper arm.  She was markedly tender over the medial epicondyle, but also the olecranon and distal process and she was exquisitely tender over the ulnar nerve.  I did not detect subluxation of the ulnar nerve with flexion and extension.  With this, she was extremely tender in this area.  There is no instability of the elbow.  Range of motion was 0 to 145 degrees, flexion 90 degrees of pronation and supination.  The elbow flexion test was positive.  There is normal motor power in the elbow and also on the right hand, specifically in the ulnar intrinsics.  There was diminished sensation on the right ring and small fingers, specifically the ulnar side of the ring finger of the entire small finger.  There was no wasting of the intrinsics.  No clawing of the hand.  Examination of the right wrist revealed extension 45 degrees, flexion 45 degrees, radial deviation 15 degrees, and ulnar deviation 35 degrees.  She was tender over the dorsum of the hand over the ulnar head and the volar aspect of the wrist.  Wrist flexion causes paresthesias on the right ring and small fingers.  Grasp was weak.  There was no sign of causalgia, but no measurable atrophy of the forearm.  No reflex changes.,QUESTION:,  Ms. Xxxxx has filed an application of additional allowance of right cubital tunnel syndrome.  Based on the current objective findings, mechanism of injury, medical records or diagnostic studies, does the medical evidence support the existence of the requested condition?,ANSWER:,  Yes.  She has a positive elbow flexion test and she is markedly tender over the ulnar nerve at the elbow and also has diminished sensation in the ulnar nerve distribution, specifically in the entire right small finger and the ulnar half of the ring finger.  I did not find the subluxation of the ulnar nerve with flexion and extension with Dr. X did previously find on his examination.,QUESTION: , If you find these conditions exist, are they a direct and proximate result of April 26, 2006, injury?,ANSWER: , Yes.  Repeated flexion and extension would irritate the ulnar nerve particularly if it was subluxing which it could very well have which Dr. X objectively identified on his examination.  Therefore, I believe it is a direct and proximate result of April 26, 2006, injury.,QUESTION: , Do you find that Ms. Xxxxx's injury or disability is caused by natural deterioration of tissue, organ or part of the body?,ANSWER: , No.,QUESTION:,  In addition, if you find that the condition exists, are there non-occupational activities or intervening injuries that could have contributed to Ms. Xxxxx's condition?,ANSWER: , It is possible that direct injury to the ulnar nerve at the elbow could cause this syndrome; however, there is no history of this and the records do not indicate an injury of this type.,QUESTION: ,",

He is a 57-year-old assembly worker who was injured on June 13, 2007, which according to his FROI was due to ""repairing cars, down on knees to work on concrete floors.""  In addition, he slipped on an air hose on the floor at work on March 7, 2007, re-injuring his left knee.  He developed pain and swelling in his left knee.  He denies having any difficulties with his left knee prior to the injury of June 13, 2002.,DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: , August 2, 2002, MRI of the left knee showed low-grade chondromalacia of the left patellofemoral joint space and a posterior horn tear of the medial meniscus, likely degenerative in nature, and also grade II to III chondromalacia of the medial joint space.  On June 26, 2007, MRI of his left knee was referred to in the injury management report of June 19, 2007, as showing osteoarthritis of the medial compartment has advanced.  He brought with him copies of x-rays taken July 16, 2007, of his left knee, which I reviewed and which showed marked narrowing of the medial compartment of his left knee with spurs on the margins of the joint medially and also spurs on the patella.  There was subluxation of the tibia on the femur with standing.,After his injury, he received treatment from Dr. X for patellofemoral syndrome with knee sleeve.  He also received treatment from Dr. Y also for left knee sprain and patellar pain.  He also did exercise, does use a knee sleeve and Aleve.  On December 5, 2002, he underwent arthroscopy of the left knee by Dr. Z who did a partial resection of a torn medial meniscus.  He also noticed grade III chondromalacia of the patella as well as the torn medial meniscus.  He states that he was asymptomatic until he slipped on an air hose while at work on March 7, 2007, and again developed pain and swelling in his left knee.  Standing aggravates his pain.  He has had one injection of cortisone by Dr. Z about a month ago, which has helped his pain.  He takes one hydrocodone 7.5/750 mg daily.,Examination of his left knee revealed there was bilateral varus deformity, healed arthroscopy incisional scars, there was a 1/2 atrophy of the left calf.  There was patellar crepitus with knee motion.  There was no motor weakness or reflex changes.  He walked without a limp and could stand on his heels and toes equally well.  There was no instability of the knee and no effusion.  Range of motion was 0 to 120 degrees.,QUESTION: , Xxxxx has recently filed to reactivate this claim.  Please give me your opinion as to whether Xxxxx's current clinical presentation is related to the industrial injury stated above.,ANSWER:, Yes.  His original MRI of August 2, 2002, did show low-grade chondromalacia of the patellofemoral joint and also grade II to III chondromalacia of the medial joint space, which was the beginning of osteoarthritis.  Also, it is well known that torn medial meniscus can result in osteoarthritis of the knee; therefore, the osteoarthritis is related to his original injury of June 13, 2007, specifically to the torn medial meniscus.,QUESTION:  ,Do I believe that claim #123 should be reactivated to allow for treatment of the allowed conditions as stated?,ANSWER:, Yes, I believe it should be reactivated to allow treatment of the contested condition of osteoarthritis of his left knee.,QUESTION:,  Xxxxx has filed an application for additional allowance of osteoarthritis of the left knee.  Based on the current objective findings, mechanism of injury, medical records, and diagnostic studies, does the medical evidence support the existence of the requested condition?,ANSWER: ,Yes.  Please see the discussion in the answer to question no one.  In addition, x-rays of July 16, 2007, do reveal medial compartment and patellofemoral compartment osteoarthritis of the left knee.,QUESTION: , If you find this condition exists, is it a direct and proximate result of the June 13, 2002, injury?,ANSWER:, Yes.  See discussion in answer to question number one.,QUESTION: , Do you find that Xxxxx's injury or disability was caused by the natural deterioration of tissue, an organ or part of body?,ANSWER: ,No.  I believe the osteoarthritis was the result of the torn medial meniscus as discussed under question number one.,QUESTION: , In addition, if you find the condition exists, are there non-occupational activities or intervening injuries, which could have contributed to Xxxxx's condition?,ANSWER:, No.  He does not give any history of any intervening injuries.,If you opine the requested condition should be additionally recognized, please include the condition as an allowed condition in the discussion of the following questions.,QUESTION:,  Based on the objective findings is the request for 10 sessions of physical therapy per C-9 dated July 27, 2007, medically necessary and appropriate for the allowed conditions of the claim of osteoarthritis of left knee?,ANSWER:,  Yes.,",

She has difficulty with pushing and pulling and lifting with her right arm.  She describes an intermittent tingling sensation in the volar aspect of her right hand.  She states she has diminished grip strength in her right hand because of wrist pain complaints.  She states that the Wellbutrin samples I had given her previously for depression seem to be helping.  Her affect appears appropriate.  She reports no suicidal ideation.  She states she continues to use Naprosyn as an anti-inflammatory, Biofreeze ointment over her neck and shoulder and back areas of complaints.  She also takes Imitrex occasionally for headache complaints related to her neck pain.  She also takes Flexeril occasionally for back spasms and Darvocet for pain.  She is asking for a refill on some of her medications today.  She is relating a VAS pain score regarding her lower back at a 6-7/10 and regarding her neck about 3/10, and regarding her right upper extremity about a 4/10., ,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , She is afebrile.  Blood pressure is 106/68, pulse of 64, respirations of 20.  Her physical exam is unchanged from 03/21/05.  Her orthopedic exam reveals full range of motion of the cervical spine.  Cervical compression test is negative.  Valsalva's maneuver is negative.  Hoffmann's sign is negative.  DTRs are +1 at the biceps, brachioradialis and trapezius bilaterally.  Her sensation is grossly intact to the upper extremity dermatomes.  Motor strength appears 5/5 strength in the upper extremity muscle groups tested.,Phalen's and Tinel's signs are negative at both wrists.  Passive range of motion of the right wrist is painful for her.  Passive range of motion of the left wrist is non painful.  Active range of motion of both wrists and hands are full.  She is right hand dominant.  Circumferential measurements were taken in her upper extremities.  She is 11"" in the right biceps, 10 1/2"" in the left biceps.  She is 9 3/4"" in both right and left forearms.  Circumferential measurements were also taken of the lower extremities.  She is 21"" at both the right and left thighs, 15"" in both the right and left calves.  Jamar dynamometry was assessed on three tries in this right-hand-dominant individual.  She is 42/40/40 pounds on the right hand with good effort, and on the left is 60/62/60 pounds, suggesting a loss of at least 20% to 25% pre-injury grip strength in the right dominant hand.  , ,Examination of her lumbar trunk reveals decreased range of motion, flexion allowing her fingertips about 12"" from touching the floor.  Lumbar extension is to 30 degrees.  The right SLR is limited to about 80 degrees, provoking back pain, with a positive Bragard's maneuver, causing pain to radiate to the back of the thigh.  The left SLR is to 90 degrees without back pain.  DTRs are +1 at the knees and ankles.  Toes are downgoing to plantar reflexes bilaterally.

She exhibits diminished grip strength in the right arm and upper extremity., ,SUBJECTIVE: ,1.  Based on her headache complaints alone, would be considered occasional and minimal to slight at best. ,2.  With regards to her neck pain complaints, these would be considered occasional and slight at best. ,3.  Regarding her lower back pain complaints, would be considered frequent and slight at rest, with an increase to a moderate level of pain with repetitive bending and stooping and heavy lifting, and prolonged standing. ,4.  Regarding her right upper extremity and wrist pain complaints, these would be considered occasional and slight at rest, but increasing to slight to moderate with repetitive gripping, grasping, and torquing maneuvers of her right upper extremity. ,LOSS OF PRE-INJURY CAPACITY: , The patient advises that prior to her industrial dates of injury she was capable of repetitively bending and stooping and lifting at least 60 pounds.  She states she now has difficulty lifting more than 10 or 15 pounds without exacerbating back pain.  She has trouble trying to repetitively push or pull, torque, twist and lift with the right upper extremity, due to wrist pain, which she did not have prior to her industrial injury dates.  She also relates headaches, which she did not have prior to her industrial injury.  , ,WORK RESTRICTIONS AND DISABILITY: , I would find it reasonable to place some permanent restrictions on this patient.  It is my opinion she has a disability precluding heavy work, which contemplates the individual has lost approximately half of her pre-injury capacity for performing such activities as bending, stooping, lifting, pushing, pulling and climbing or other activities involving comparable physical effort.  The patient should probably no lift more than 15 to 20 pounds maximally.  She should probably not repetitively bend or stoop.  She should avoid repetitive pushing, pulling or torquing maneuvers, as well as gripping and grasping maneuvers of the right hand.  She should probably not lift more than 10 pounds repetitively with the right upper extremity.  I suspect that prior to her industrial she could lift repetitively and push, pull, torque and twist at least 20 to 25 pounds with the right upper extremity.  , ,CAUSATION AND APPORTIONMENT:, With regards to issues of causation, they appear appropriate to her industrial injuries and histories given per the 05/16/03 and the 02/10/04 injuries., ,With regards issues of apportionment, it is my opinion that 100% of her pain complaints are industrially related to her industrial injuries of 05/16/03 and 02/10/04.  There does not appear to be any apportionable issues here.",

117,315,3091, Is it BNP or BMP?, Lab Medicine - Pathology,3, BNP v/s BMP ,"BNP, (brain natriuretic peptide or B-type natriuretic peptide) is a substance produced in the  heart ventricles when there is excessive strain to the heart muscles.  A blood test for this can be used as an effective parameter for detecting an acute event of congestive heart failure, where the heart is unable to pump sufficient amount of blood required by the body's needs.  When a person has a heart failure (such as MI), BNP is secreted so immensely that it sits well above the measurable range.  Values above 100 signal a problematic situation and those above 500 a highly demanding state.  Note that a person with a remote history of heart problems may not have BNP levels elevated, but it is used as a measure of acute events.,On the other hand, ,BMP, or basic metabolic panel is not a single test but a group of 8 tests (glucose, calcium, sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, chloride, BUN, creatinine).  Any test that has the word panel in it is not a single test, so cannot have a single value.,With this logic in mind, if a doctor uses phrases like ""BNP/BMP is elevated/negative/positive/is greater than/less than etc."" and then a single value, it may not be BMP.  You can also take the hint from the file whether the patient presented to the hospital with an acute coronary event.  Likewise, if he says multiple values for this test, this must be BMP.,","lab medicine - pathology, brain natriuretic peptide, b-type natriuretic peptide, basic metabolic panel, glucose, calcium, sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, chloride, bun, creatinine, natriuretic peptide, bmp, bnp,"

I appreciate you speaking with me while he was in clinic.  He continues to have abdominal pain, and he had a diuretic renal scan, which indicates no evidence of obstruction and good differential function bilaterally. ,When I examined him, he seems to indicate that his pain is essentially in the lower abdomen in the suprapubic region; however, on actual physical examination, he seems to complain of pain through his entire right side.  His parents have brought up the question of whether this could be gastrointestinal in origin and that is certainly an appropriate consideration.  They also feel that since he has been on Detrol, his pain levels have been somewhat worse, and so, I have given them the option of stopping the Detrol initially.  I think he should stay on MiraLax for management of his bowels.  I would also suggest that he be referred to Pediatric Gastroenterology for evaluation.  If they do not find any abnormalities from a gastrointestinal perspective, then the next step would be to endoscope his bladder and then make sure that he does not have any evidence of bladder anatomic abnormalities that is leading to this pain. ,Thank you for following XXXX along with us in Pediatric Urology Clinic.

120,318,3062, Reflex sympathetic dystrophy of both lower extremities., Letters,3, Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy - Letter ,"Doctor's Address,Dear Doctor:,This letter serves as a reintroduction of my patient, A, who will be seeing you on Thursday, 06/12/2008.  As you know, he is an unfortunate gentleman who has reflex sympathetic dystrophy of both lower extremities.  His current symptoms are more severe on the right and he has had a persisting wound that has failed to heal on his right leg.  He has been through Wound Clinic to try to help heal this, but was intolerant of compression dressings and was unable to get satisfactory healing of this.  He has been seen by Dr. X for his pain management and was considered for the possibility of amputation being a therapeutic option to help reduce his pain.  He was seen by Dr. Y at Orthopedic Associates for review of this.  However, in my discussion with Dr. Z and his evaluation of Mr. A, it was felt that this may be an imprudent path to take given the lack of likelihood of reduction of his pain from his RST, his questionable healing of his wound given noninvasive studies that did reveal tenuous oxygenation of the right lower leg, and concerns of worsening of his RST symptoms on his left leg if he would have an amputation.  Based on the results of his transcutaneous oxygen levels and his dramatic improvement with oxygen therapy at this test, Dr. Z felt that a course of hyperbaric oxygen may be of utility to help in improving his wounds.  As you may or may not know we have certainly pursued aggressive significant measures to try to improve Mr. A's pain.  He has been to Cleveland Clinic for implantable stimulator, which was unsuccessful at dramatically improving his pain.  He currently is taking methadone up to eight tablets four times a day, morphine up to 100 mg three times a day, and Dilaudid two tablets by mouth every two hours to help reduce his pain.  He also is currently taking Neurontin 1600 mg three times a day, Effexor XR 250 mg once a day, Cytomel 25 mcg once a day, Seroquel 100 mg p.o. q. day, levothyroxine 300 mcg p.o. q. day, Prinivil 20 mg p.o. q. day, and Mevacor 40 mg p.o. q day.,I appreciate your assistance in determining if hyperbaric oxygen is a reasonable treatment course for this unfortunate situation.  Dr. Z and I have both tried to stress the fact that amputation may be an abrupt and irreversible treatment course that may not reach any significant conclusion.  He has been evaluated by Dr. X for rehab concerns to determine.  He agrees that a less aggressive form of therapy may be most appropriate.,I thank you kindly for your prompt evaluation of this kind gentleman in an unfortunate situation.  If you have any questions regarding his care please feel free to call me at my office.  Otherwise, I look forward to hearing back from you shortly after your evaluation.  Please feel free to call me if it is possible or if you have any questions about anything.","letters, rsd, reflex sympathetic dystrophy, orthopedic, oxygenationNOTE,: Thesetranscribed medical transcription sample reports and examples are provided by various users andare for reference purpose only.

I examined Mrs. ABC initially on MM/DD/YYYY.  At that time, she expressed a chief concern of occasional pain around her eye, but denied any flashing lights, floaters, halos, or true brow ache.  She reports a family history of glaucoma in her mother, but is unsure of the specific kind.  Her past ocular history has been fairly unremarkable.  As you know, she has a history of non-insulin dependent diabetes.  She is unaware of her last hemoglobin A1c levels, but reports a blood sugar of 158 taken on the morning of her appointment with me.  She is followed by Dr. X here locally.,Upon examination, her visual acuity measured 20/20-1 in either eye with her glasses.  Presenting intraocular pressures were14 mmHg in either eye at 2:03 p.m.  Pupillary reactions, confrontational visual fields, and ocular motility were normal.  The slit lamp exam revealed narrow anterior chambers and on gonioscopy only the buried anterior trabecular meshwork was visible in either eye, but the angle deepened with gonio-compression suggesting appositional and not synechial closure.  I deferred the dilated portion of the exam on that day.,We proceeded with peripheral iridectomies and following this upon her most recent visit on MM/DD/YYYY, I was able to safely dilate her eyes as her chambers had deepened and the PIs were patent.  I note that she has an increased CD ratio measuring 0.65 in the right eye and 0.7 in the left and although her FDT visual fields and GDX testing were normal at your office, she does have an enlarged blind spot in either eye on Humphrey visual fields and retinal tomography also shows some suspicious changes.  Therefore, I feel she has sustained some optic nerve damage perhaps from intermittent angle closure in the past.,In summary, Mrs. ABC has a history of narrow angles not successfully treated with laser PIs.  Her intraocular pressures have remained stable.  I will continue to monitor her closely.,Thank you very much once again for allowing me to have shared in her care.

130,329,3077, Patient seen in Neuro-Oncology Clinic because of increasing questions about what to do next for his anaplastic astrocytoma., Letters,3, Anaplastic Astrocytoma - Letter ,"XYZ,RE:  ABC,MEDICAL RECORD#:  123,Dear Dr. XYZ:,I saw ABC back in Neuro-Oncology Clinic today.  He comes in for an urgent visit because of increasing questions about what to do next for his anaplastic astrocytoma.,Within the last several days, he has seen you in clinic and once again discussed whether or not to undergo radiation for his left temporal lesion.  The patient has clearly been extremely ambivalent about this therapy for reasons that are not immediately apparent.  It is clear that his MRI is progressing and that it seems unlikely at this time that anything other than radiation would be particularly effective.  Despite repeatedly emphasizing this; however, the patient still is worried about potential long-term side effects from treatment that frankly seem unwarranted at this particular time.,After seeing you in clinic, he and his friend again wanted to discuss possible changes in the chemotherapy regimen.  They came in with a list of eight possible agents that they would like to be administered within the next two weeks.  They then wanted another MRI to be performed and they were hoping that with the use of this type of approach, they might be able to induce another remission from which he can once again be spared radiation.,From my view, I noticed a man whose language has deteriorated in the week since I last saw him.  This is very worrisome.  Today, for the first time, I felt that there was a definite right facial droop as well.  Therefore, there is no doubt that he is becoming symptomatic from his growing tumor.  It suggests that he is approaching the end of his compliance curve and that the things may rapidly deteriorate in the near future.,Emphasizing this once again, in addition, to recommending steroids I once again tried to convince him to undergo radiation.  Despite an hour, this again amazingly was not possible.  It is not that he does not want treatment, however.  Because I told him that I did not feel it was ethical to just put him on the radical regimen that him and his friend devised, we compromised and elected to go back to Temodar in a low dose daily type regimen.  We would plan on giving 75 mg/sq m everyday for 21 days out of 28 days.  In addition, we will stop thalidomide 100 mg/day.  If he tolerates this for one week, we then agree that we would institute another one of the medications that he listed for us.  At this stage, we are thinking of using Accutane at that point.,While I am very uncomfortable with this type of approach, I think as long as he is going to be monitored closely that we may be able to get away with this for at least a reasonable interval.  In the spirit of compromise, he again consented to be evaluated by radiation and this time, seemed more resigned to the fact that it was going to happen sooner than later.  I will look at this as a positive sign because I think radiation is the one therapy from which he can get a reasonable response in the long term.,I will keep you apprised of followups.  If you have any questions or if I could be of any further assistance, feel free to contact me.,Sincerely,","letters, neuro oncology, anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic, oncology, radiation, astrocytoma"
131,330,3080, Letter to the patient to let him know about his abnormal cholesterol test results., Letters,3, Abnormal Cholesterol Result - Letter ,"ABNORMAL CHOLESTEROL RESULT LETTER,Recently you had a cholesterol test done.  The cholesterol levels were abnormal.  These are usually associated with increased risk for stroke and heart attack.  I am writing this letter to you to let you know that your levels are high enough that I think intervention is the next best step.  I would like you to make an appointment, if you are interested in treatment for this.  There are several treatment options available at this time.  Diet is one of the options, although there is limited reduction in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol with dieting.  Most of the time under strict diet patients can achieve a 15% reduction in cholesterol.  If your cholesterol levels are moderate to severely elevated, usually diet is not the first line of therapy.  If you are diabetic or have hypertension these two also increase your risk with the combination of hypercholesterolemia.  Most of the time cholesterol that is elevated is from your genetic background and is independent of diet.  New research shows that treatment of high cholesterol can decrease your risk of developing Alzheimer‚Äôs disease.,Again, I am recommending at least we discuss medical treatment for hypercholesterolemia.  Please consider calling for a followup appointment concerning your cholesterol levels.  If you should have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Apparently this man was found down by a family member, was taken to Medical Center, and subsequently flown here. He has got respiratory failure, multi-organ system failure syndrome, and has renal insufficiency, as well. Markers of renal function have been fairly stable. I do not presently see indicators that he historically has been oliguric. The BUN and creatinine have been fairly stable. It is not clear whether he was taking his lisinopril up until the time of his demise, and it is also not clear whether he was taking his diuretic. Earlier thoughts had been that he could have had rhabdomyolysis, but the highest CPK I find recorded is 1500, the phosphorus is not elevated, though I acknowledge the serum calcium is low. I see no markers of myoglobinuria nor serum level of myoglobin. He has received IV fluid resuscitation, good broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, continues mechanically ventilated, and is on parenteral nutrition.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:, Not obtained from the patient, but is reviewed in other physician's notes and seems notable for probably atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease wherein he was taking Imdur and digoxin, reportedly. A suggestion of hypertensive disease versus BPH, he was on terazosin. Suggestion of CHF versus hypertension versus volume overload, treated with Lasix. He was iron, I presume for anemia. He was on potassium, lisinopril and aspirin.,ALLERGIES:, OTHER PHYSICIAN'S NOTES INDICATE NO KNOWN ALLERGIES.,FAMILY HISTORY:, Not available.,SOCIAL HISTORY:, Not available.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:, Not available.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL: An older white male who is intubated, edematous, and appears uncomfortable.,HEENT: Male pattern baldness.

Neck vein distention is not seen.,LUNGS: He has diffuse expiratory wheezing anteriorly, laterally and posteriorly. I would describe the wheezes as coarse. I hear no present rales. Breath sounds otherwise are symmetrical.,HEART: Heart tones regular to auscultation, currently without audible rub or gallop sounds.,BREASTS: Not enlarged.,ABDOMEN: On plane. Bowel sounds presently are normal. Abdomen, I believe, is soft on plane, normal bowel sounds, no bruits, no liver edge felt, no HJR, no spleen tip, no suprapubic fullness.,GU: Catheter draining a dark yellow urine.,EXTREMITIES: Very edematous. Pulses not palpable. Cyanosis not observed. Fungal changes are not observed.,NEUROLOGICAL: Not otherwise assessed.,LABORATORY DATA:, Reviewed.,IMPRESSION:,1. Acute renal failure, suspected. Likely due to multi-organ system failure syndrome, with antecedent lisinopril use at home and at time of demise. He also reportedly was on Lasix prior to hospitalization, ? hypovolemia as a consequence.,2. Multi-organ system failure/systemic inflammatory response syndrome, with septic shock.,3.

Diffuse aspiration pneumonitis suggested.,DISCUSSION/PLAN: ,I think the renal function will follow the patient. Supportive care, attention to stability of a euvolemic state, will be important at this time. He is currently nonoliguric, has apparently stable, diffuse, bilateral wheezing, with adequate gas exchange. He is on TPN, antimicrobials, and has been on vasopressive agents. Blood pressures are close to acceptable, he may now be wearing off his lisinopril, assuming he was taking it prior to admission.,I would use diuretics to maintain central euvolemia.

The patient recently underwent a fistulogram with angioplasty at the proximal upper arm cephalic vein due to a stenosis detected on Duplex ultrasound.  The patient subsequently was noted to have poor flow to the fistula, and the fistula was difficult to palpate.  A repeat ultrasound was performed which demonstrated a high-grade stenosis involving the distal upper arm cephalic vein just distal to the brachial anastomosis.  The patient presents today for a left arm fistulogram with angioplasty.  The risks, benefits, and alternatives of the procedure were discussed with the patient and understands and in agreement to proceed.,PROCEDURE DETAILS:  ,The patient was brought to the angio suite and laid supine on the table.  After sedation was administered, the left arm was then prepped and draped in a standard surgical fashion.  Continuous pulse oximetry and cardiac monitoring were performed throughout the procedure.  The patient was given 1 g of IV Ancef prior to incision.,The left brachiocephalic fistula was visualized with bevel ultrasound.  The cephalic vein in the proximal upper arm region appeared to be of adequate caliber.  There was an area of stenosis at the proximal cephalic vein just distal to the brachial artery anastomosis.  The cephalic vein in the proximal forearm region was easily compressible.  The skin overlying the vessel was injected with 1% lidocaine solution.  A small incision was made with the #11 blade.  The cephalic vein then was cannulated with a 5 French micropuncture introducer sheath.  The sheath was advanced over the wire.  A fistulogram was performed which demonstrated a high-grade stenosis just distal to the brachial artery anastomosis.  The introducer sheath was then exchanged for a 5 French sheath over a 0.025 guide wire.  The sheath was aspirated and flushed with heparinized saline solution.  A 0.025 glidewire was then obtained and advanced, placed over the sheath and across the area of stenosis into the brachial artery.  A 5 French short Kumpe catheter was used to guide the wire into the distal brachial and radial artery.  After crossing the area of stenosis, a 5 x 20 mm standard angioplasty balloon was obtained and prepped from the back table.  This was placed over the glidewire into the area of stenosis and inflated to 14 mmHg pressure and then deflated.  The balloon was then removed over the wire and repeat fistulogram was performed which demonstrated significant improvement.  However, there is still a remainder of residual stenosis.  The 5-mm balloon was placed over the wire again and a repeat angioplasty was performed.  The balloon was then removed over the wire and a repeat angiogram was performed which demonstrated again an area of stenosis right at the anastomosis.  The glidewire was removed and a 0.014 guide wire was then obtained and placed through the sheath and across the brachial anastomosis and into the radial artery.  A 4 x 20 mm cutting balloon was obtained and prepped on the back table.  The 5 French sheath was then exchanged for a 6 French sheath.  The balloon was then placed over the 0.014 guide wire into the area of stenosis and then inflated to normal pressures at 8 mmHg.  The balloon was then deflated and removed over the wire.  A 5 mm x 20 mm balloon was obtained and prepped and placed over the wire into the area of stenosis and inflated to pressures of 14 mmHg.  A repeat fistulogram was performed after the removal of the balloon which demonstrated excellent results with no significant residual stenosis.  The patient actually had a nice palpable thrill at this point.  The fistulogram of the distal cephalic vein at the subclavian anastomosis was performed which demonstrated a mild area of stenosis.  The sheath was removed and blood pressure was held over the puncture site for approximately 10 minutes.,After hemostasis was achieved, the cephalic vein again was visualized with bevel ultrasound.  The proximal cephalic vein was then cannulated after injecting the skin overlying the vessel with a 1% lidocaine solution.  A 5 French micropuncture introducer sheath was then placed over the wire into the proximal cephalic vein.  A repeat fistulogram was performed which demonstrated an area of stenosis within the distal cephalic vein just prior to the subclavian vein confluence.  The 5 French introducer sheath was then exchanged for a 5 French sheath.  The 5 mm x 20 mm balloon was placed over a 0.035 glidewire across the area of stenosis.  The balloon was inflated to 14 mmHg.  The balloon was then deflated and a repeat fistulogram was performed through the sheath which demonstrated good results.  The sheath was then removed and blood pressure was held over the puncture site for approximately 10 minutes.  After adequate hemostasis was achieved, the area was cleansed in 2x2 and Tegaderm was applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure without any complications.  I was present for the entire case.  The sponge, instrument, and needle counts are correct at the end of the case.  The patient was subsequently taken to PACU in stable condition.,ANGIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS:,  The initial left arm brachiocephalic fistulogram demonstrated a stenosis at the brachial artery anastomosis and distally within the cephalic vein.  After standard balloon angioplasty, there was a mild improvement but some residual area of stenosis remained at the anastomosis.  Then postcutting balloon angioplasty, venogram demonstrated a significant improvement without any evidence of significant stenosis.,Fistulogram of the proximal cephalic vein demonstrated a stenosis just prior to the confluence with the left subclavian vein.  Postangioplasty demonstrated excellent results with the standard balloon.  There was no evidence of any contrast extravasation.,IMPRESSION,1.

The patient was found to have lumbar diskitis and was going to require extensive antibiotic therapy, which was the cause of need for continued hospitalization.  He also needed to continue with dialysis and he needed to improve his rehabilitation.  The patient tolerated his medication well and he was going through rehab fairly well without any significant troubles.  He did have some bouts of issues with constipation on and off throughout his hospitalization, but this seemed to come under control with more aggressive management.  The patient had remained afebrile.  He did also have a bout with some episodic confusion problems, which appeared to be more of a sundowner-type of a problem, but this too cleared with his stay here at Promise.  On the day of discharge, on May 9, 2008, the patient was in good spirits, was very clear and lucid.  He denied any complaints of pain.  He did have some trouble with sleep at night at times, but I think this was mainly tied into the fact that he sleeps a lot during the day.  The patient has increased his appetite some and has been eating some.  His vital signs remain stable.  His blood pressure on discharge was 126/63, heart rate is 80, respiratory rate of 20 and temperature was 98.3.  PPD was negative.  An SMS form was filled out in plan for his discharge and he was sent with medications that he had been receiving while here at Promise.,The patient and his family understood our plan and agreed with it.  He thanked us for the care that he received at Promise and thought that they did a fantastic job taking care of him.  He did not have any acute questions as to where he was going and what the next step of his care would be, but we did discuss this at length prior to date of discharge.,","nephrology, end-stage renal disease, thrombocytopenia, anemia, hospitalization, hemodialysis and rehab, hemodialysis "

", Neurology,3, Ulnar Nerve Transposition ,"PROCEDURE:,  Subcutaneous ulnar nerve transposition.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After administering appropriate antibiotics and MAC anesthesia, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual standard fashion.  The arm was exsanguinated with Esmarch, and the tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg.,A curvilinear incision was made over the medial elbow, starting proximally at the medial intermuscular septum, curving posterior to the medial epicondyle, then curving anteriorly along the path of the ulnar nerve.  Dissection was carried down to the ulnar nerve.  Branches of the medial antebrachial and the medial brachial cutaneous nerves were identified and protected.,Osborne's fascia was released, an ulnar neurolysis performed, and the ulnar nerve was mobilized.  Six cm of the medial intermuscular septum was excised, and the deep periosteal origin of the flexor carpi ulnaris was released to avoid kinking of the nerve as it was moved anteriorly.,The subcutaneous plane just superficial to the flexor-pronator mass was developed.  Meticulous hemostasis was maintained with bipolar electrocautery.  The nerve was transposed anteriorly, superficial to the flexor-pronator mass.  Motor branches were dissected proximally and distally to avoid tethering or kinking the ulnar nerve.,A semicircular medially based flap of flexor-pronator fascia was raised and sutured to the subcutaneous tissue in such a way as to prevent the nerve from relocating.  The subcutaneous tissue and skin were closed with simple interrupted sutures.  Marcaine with epinephrine was injected into the wound.  The elbow was dressed and splinted.  The patient was awakened and sent to the recovery room in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well.","neurology, neurolysis, ulnar, periosteal, flexor-pronator mass, ulnar nerve transposition, medial intermuscular septum, nerve transposition, intermuscular septum, flexor pronator, ulnar nerve, nerve"
161,362,2766, A 92-year-old female had a transient episode of slurred speech and numbness of her left cheek for a few hours. , Neurology,1, TIA - Cosult ,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION: , This 92-year-old female states that last night she had a transient episode of slurred speech and numbness of her left cheek for a few hours.  However, the chart indicates that she had recurrent TIAs x3 yesterday, each lasting about 5 minutes with facial drooping and some mental confusion.  She had also complained of blurred vision for several days.  She was brought to the emergency room last night, where she was noted to have a left carotid bruit and was felt to have recurrent TIAs.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , The patient is on Lanoxin, amoxicillin, Hydergine, Cardizem, Lasix, Micro-K and a salt-free diet.  ,SOCIAL HISTORY: , She does not smoke or drink alcohol.,FINDINGS:  ,Admission CT scan of the head showed a densely calcified mass lesion of the sphenoid bone, probably representing the benign osteochondroma seen on previous studies.  CBC was normal, aside from a hemoglobin of 11.2.  ECG showed atrial fibrillation.  BUN was 22, creatinine normal, CPK normal, glucose normal, electrolytes normal.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , On examination, the patient is noted to be alert and fully oriented.  She has some impairment of recent memory.  She is not dysphasic, or apraxic.  Speech is normal and clear.  The head is noted to be normocephalic.  Neck is supple.  Carotid pulses are full bilaterally, with left carotid bruit.  Neurologic exam shows cranial nerve function II through XII to be intact, save for some slight flattening of the left nasolabial fold.  Motor examination shows no drift of the outstretched arms.  There is no tremor or past-pointing.  Finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin performed well bilaterally.  Motor showed intact neuromuscular tone, strength, and coordination in all limbs.  Reflexes 1+ and symmetrical, with bilateral plantar flexion, absent jaw jerk, no snout.  Sensory exam is intact to pinprick touch, vibration, position, temperature, and graphesthesia.,IMPRESSION: , Neurological examination is normal, aside from mild impairment of recent memory, slight flattening of the left nasolabial fold, and left carotid bruit.  She also has atrial fibrillation, apparently chronic.  In view of her age and the fact that she is in chronic atrial fibrillation, I would suspect that she most likely has had an embolic phenomenon as the cause of her TIAs.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,  I would recommend conservative management with antiplatelet agents unless a near occlusion of the carotid arteries is demonstrated, in which case you might consider it best to do an angiography and consider endarterectomy.  In view of her age, I would be reluctant to recommend Coumadin anticoagulation.  I will be happy to follow the patient with you.","neurology, atrial fibrillation, carotid bruit, slurred speech, numbness, calcified mass lesion, neurological examination, tias, carotid, benign,"

166,367,2776, Reflex sympathetic dystrophy of both lower extremities., Neurology,3, Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy - Letter ,"Doctor's Address,Dear Doctor:,This letter serves as a reintroduction of my patient, A, who will be seeing you on Thursday, 06/12/2008.  As you know, he is an unfortunate gentleman who has reflex sympathetic dystrophy of both lower extremities.  His current symptoms are more severe on the right and he has had a persisting wound that has failed to heal on his right leg.  He has been through Wound Clinic to try to help heal this, but was intolerant of compression dressings and was unable to get satisfactory healing of this.  He has been seen by Dr. X for his pain management and was considered for the possibility of amputation being a therapeutic option to help reduce his pain.  He was seen by Dr. Y at Orthopedic Associates for review of this.  However, in my discussion with Dr. Z and his evaluation of Mr. A, it was felt that this may be an imprudent path to take given the lack of likelihood of reduction of his pain from his RST, his questionable healing of his wound given noninvasive studies that did reveal tenuous oxygenation of the right lower leg, and concerns of worsening of his RST symptoms on his left leg if he would have an amputation.  Based on the results of his transcutaneous oxygen levels and his dramatic improvement with oxygen therapy at this test, Dr. Z felt that a course of hyperbaric oxygen may be of utility to help in improving his wounds.  As you may or may not know we have certainly pursued aggressive significant measures to try to improve Mr. A's pain.  He has been to Cleveland Clinic for implantable stimulator, which was unsuccessful at dramatically improving his pain.  He currently is taking methadone up to eight tablets four times a day, morphine up to 100 mg three times a day, and Dilaudid two tablets by mouth every two hours to help reduce his pain.  He also is currently taking Neurontin 1600 mg three times a day, Effexor XR 250 mg once a day, Cytomel 25 mcg once a day, Seroquel 100 mg p.o. q. day, levothyroxine 300 mcg p.o. q. day, Prinivil 20 mg p.o. q. day, and Mevacor 40 mg p.o. q day.,I appreciate your assistance in determining if hyperbaric oxygen is a reasonable treatment course for this unfortunate situation.  Dr. Z and I have both tried to stress the fact that amputation may be an abrupt and irreversible treatment course that may not reach any significant conclusion.  He has been evaluated by Dr. X for rehab concerns to determine.  He agrees that a less aggressive form of therapy may be most appropriate.,I thank you kindly for your prompt evaluation of this kind gentleman in an unfortunate situation.  If you have any questions regarding his care please feel free to call me at my office.  Otherwise, I look forward to hearing back from you shortly after your evaluation.  Please feel free to call me if it is possible or if you have any questions about anything.","neurology, rsd, reflex sympathetic dystrophy, orthopedic, oxygenationNOTE,: Thesetranscribed medical transcription sample reports and examples are provided by various users andare for reference purpose only.

", Neurology,1, Pseudotumor Cerebri ,"REASON FOR VISIT:  ,The patient is a 38-year-old woman with pseudotumor cerebri without papilledema who comes in because of new onset of headaches.  She comes to clinic by herself.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , Dr. X has cared for her since 2002.  She has a Codman-Hakim shunt set at 90 mmH2O.  She last saw us in clinic in January 2008 and at that time we recommended that she followup with Dr. Y for medical management of her chronic headaches.  We also recommended that the patient see a psychiatrist regarding her depression, which she stated that she would followup with that herself.  Today, the patient returns to clinic because of acute onset of headaches that she has had since her shunt was adjusted after an MRI on 04/18/08.  She states that since that time her headaches have been bad.  They woke her up at night.  She has not been able to sleep.  She has not had a good sleep cycle since that time.  She states that the pain is constant and is worse with coughing, straining, and sneezing as well as on standing up.  She states that they feel a little bit better when lying down.  Medication shave not helped her.  She has tried taking Imitrex as well as Motrin 800 mg twice a day, but she states it has not provided much relief.  The pain is generalized, but also noted to be quite intense in the frontal region of her head.  She also reports ringing in the ears and states that she just does not feel well.  She reports no nausea at this time.  She also states that she has been experiencing intermittent blurry vision and dimming lights as well.  She tells me that she has an appointment with Dr. Y tomorrow.  She reports no other complaints at this time.,MAJOR FINDINGS:,  On examination today, this is a pleasant 38-year-old woman who comes back from the clinic waiting area without difficulty.

I had programmed her shunt back to 90 mmH2O at that time and confirmed it with an x-ray.  However, the picture of the x-ray was not the most desirable picture.  Thus, I decided to reprogram the shunt back to 90 mmH2O today and have the patient return to Sinai for a skull x-ray to confirm the setting at 90.  In addition, she told me that she is scheduled to see Dr. Y tomorrow, so she should followup with him and also plan on contacting the Wilmer Eye Institute to setup an appointment.  She should followup with the Wilmer Eye Institute as she is complaining of blurry vision and dimming of the lights occasionally.,Total visit time was approximately 60 minutes and about 10 minutes of that time was spent in counseling the patient.","neurology, migraine headaches, pseudotumor cerebri without papilledema, onset of headaches, blurry vision, shunt adjustment, pseudotumor cerebri, headaches, pseudotumor, cerebri, papilledema"

Two years ago, a similar prolonged confusional spell was reported as well.  A comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning.", Neurology,3, Neuropsychological Evaluation - 3 ,"REASON FOR REFERRAL:,  The patient is a 76-year-old Caucasian gentleman who works full-time as a tax attorney.  He was referred for a neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. X after a recent hospitalization for possible transient ischemic aphasia.  Two years ago, a similar prolonged confusional spell was reported as well.  A comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning.,RELEVANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION: , Historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and clinical interview with the patient.  A summary of pertinent information is presented below.  Please refer to the patient's medical chart for a more complete history.,HISTORY OF PRESENTING PROBLEM: , The patient was brought to the Hospital Emergency Department on 09/30/09 after experiencing an episode of confusion for which he has no recall the previous day.  He has no recollection of the event.  The following information is obtained from his medical record.  On 09/29/09, he reportedly went to a five-hour meeting and stated several times ""I do not feel well"" and looked ""glazed.""  He does not remember anything from midmorning until the middle of the night and when his wife came home, she found him in bed at 6 p.m., which is reportedly unusual.  She thought he was warm and had chills.  He later returned to his baseline.  He was seen by Dr. X in the hospital on 09/30/09 and reported to him at that time that he felt that he had returned entirely to baseline.  His neurological exam at that time was unremarkable aside from missing one of three items on recall for the Mini-Mental Status Examination.  Due to mild memory complaints from himself and his wife, he was referred for more extensive neuropsychological testing.  Note that reportedly when his wife found him in bed, he was shaking and feeling nauseated, somewhat clammy and kept saying that he could not remember anything and he was repeating himself, asking the same questions in an agitated way, so she brought him to the emergency room.  The patient had an episode two years ago of transient loss of memory during which he was staring blankly while sitting at his desk at work and the episode lasted approximately two hours.  He was hospitalized at Hospital at that time as well and evaluation included negative EEG, MRI showing mild atrophy, and a neurological consultation, which did not result in a specific diagnosis, but during this episode he was also reportedly nauseous.  He was also reportedly amnestic for this episode.,In 2004, he had a sense of a funny feeling in his neck and electrodes in his head and had an MRI at that time which showed some small vessel changes.,During this interview, the patient reported that other than a coworker noticing a few careless errors in his completion of some documents and his wife reporting some mild memory changes that he had not noticed any significant decline.  He thought that his memory abilities were similar to those of his peers of his same age.  When I asked about this episode, he said he had no recall of it at all and that he ""felt fine the whole time.""  He appeared to be somewhat questioning of the validity of reports that he was amnestic and confused at that time.  So, The patient reported some age related ""memory lapses"" such as going into a room and forgetting why, sometimes putting something down and forgetting where he had put it.  However, he reported that these were entirely within normal expectations and he denied any type of impairment in his ability to continue to work full-time as a tax attorney other than his wife and one coworker, he had not received any feedback from his children or friends of any problems.  He denied any missed appointments, any difficulty scheduling and maintaining appointments.  He does not have to recheck information for errors.  He is able to complete tasks in the same amount of time as he always has.  He reported that he has not made additional errors in tasks that he completed.  He said he does write everything down, but has always done things that way.  He reported that he works in a position that requires a high level of attentiveness and knowledge and that will become obvious very quickly if he was having difficulties or making mistakes.  He did report some age related changes in attention as well, although very mild and he thought these were normal and not more than he would expect for his age.  He remains completely independent in his ADLs.  He denied any difficulty with driving or maintaining any activities that he had always participated in.  He is also able to handle their finances.  He did report significant stress recently particularly in relation to his work environment.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Includes coronary artery disease, status post CABG in 1991, radical prostate cancer, status post radical prostatectomy, nephrectomy for the same cancer, hypertension, lumbar surgery done twice previously, lumbar stenosis many years ago in the 1960s and 1970s, now followed by Dr. Y with another lumbar surgery scheduled to be done shortly after this evaluation, and hyperlipidemia.  Note that due to back pain, he had been taking Percocet daily prior to his hospitalization.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Celebrex 200 mg, levothyroxine 0.025 mg, Vytorin 10/40 mg, lisinopril 10 mg, Coreg 10 mg, glucosamine with chondroitin, prostate 2.2, aspirin 81 mg, and laxative stimulant or stool softener.  Note that medical records say that he was supposed to be taking Lipitor 40 mg, but it is not clear if he was doing so and also there was no specific reason found for why he was taking the levothyroxine.,OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY: , Surgical history is significant for hernia repair in 2007 as well.  The patient reported drinking an occasional glass of wine approximately two days of the week.  He quit smoking cigarettes 25 to 30 years ago and he was diagnosed with cancer.  He denied any illicit drug use.  Please add that his prostatectomy was done in 1993 and nephrectomy in 1983 for carcinoma.  He also had right carpal tunnel surgery in 2005 and has cholelithiasis.  Upon discharge from the hospital, the patient's sleep deprived EEG was recommended.,MRI completed on 09/30/09 showed ""mild cerebral and cerebellar atrophy with no significant interval change from a prior study dated June 15, 2007.  No evidence of acute intracranial processes identified.  CT scan was also unremarkable showing only mild cerebral and cerebellar atrophy.  EEG was negative.  Deferential diagnosis was transient global amnesia versus possible seizure disorder.  Note that he also reportedly has some hearing changes, but has not followed up with an evaluation for hearing aid.,FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY:, Reportedly significant for TIAs in his mother, although the patient did not report this during our evaluation and so that she had no memory problems or dementia when she passed away of old age at the age of 85.  In addition, his father had a history of heart disease and passed away at the age of 75.  He has one sister with diabetes and thought his mom might have had diabetes as well.,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  The patient obtained a law degree from the University of Baltimore.  He did not complete his undergraduate degree from the University of Maryland because he was able to transfer his credits in order to attend law school at that time.  He reported that he did not obtain very good grades until he reached law school, at which point he graduated in the top 10 of his class and had no problem passing the Bar.  He thought that effort and motivation were important to his success in his school and he had not felt very motivated previously.  He reported that he repeated math classes ""every year of school"" and attended summer school every year due to that.  He has worked as a tax attorney for the past 48 years and reported having a thriving practice with clients all across the country.  He served also in the U.S.  Coast Guard between 1951 and 1953.  He has been married for the past 36 years to his wife, Linda, who is a homemaker.  They have four children and he reported having good relationship with them.  He described being very active.  He goes for dancing four to five times a week, swims daily, plays golf regularly and spends significant amounts of time socializing with friends.,PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: , The patient denied any history of psychological or psychiatric treatment.

Although this has been a very successful treatment in terms of her febrile seizure control, she is now having occasional brief periods of pauses and staring, where she becomes unresponsive, but does not lose her postural tone.  The typical spell according to dad last anywhere from 10 to 15 seconds, mom says 3 to 4 minutes, which likely means probably somewhere in the 30- to 40-second period of time.  Mom did note that an episode had happened outside of a store recently, was associated with some perioral cyanosis, but there has never been a convulsive activity noted.  There have been no recent changes in her Keppra dosing and she is currently only at 20 mg/kg per day, which is overall a low dose for her.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Born at 36 weeks' gestation by C-section delivery at 8 pounds 3 ounces.  She does have a history of febrile seizures and what parents reported an abdominal migraine, but on further questioning, it appears to be more of a food intolerance issue.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: , She has undergone no surgical procedures.,FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY: , There is a strong history of epilepsy on the maternal side of family including mom with some nonconvulsive seizure during childhood and additional seizures in maternal great grandmother and a maternal great aunt.  There is no other significant neurological history on the paternal side of the family.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , Currently lives with her mom, dad, and two siblings.  She is at home full time and does not attend day care.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  ,Clear review of 10 systems are taken and revealed no additional findings other than those mentioned in the history of present illness.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,Vital Signs:  Weight was 15.6 kg.  She was afebrile.  Remainder of her vital signs were stable and within normal ranges for her age as per the medical record.,General:  She was awake, alert, and oriented.  She was in no acute distress, only slightly flustered when trying to place the EEG leads.,HEENT:  Showed normocephalic and atraumatic head.  Her conjunctivae were nonicteric and sclerae were clear.  Her eye movements were conjugate in nature.  Her tongue and mucous membranes were moist.,Neck:  Trachea appeared to be in the midline.,Chest:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally without crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.,Cardiovascular:  Showed a normal sinus rhythm without murmur.,Abdomen:  Showed soft, nontender, and nondistended, with good bowel sounds.  There was no hepatomegaly or splenomegaly, or other masses noted on examination.,Extremities:  Showed IV placement in the right upper extremity with appropriate restraints from the IV.  There was no evidence of clubbing, cyanosis or edema throughout.  She had no functional deformities in any of her peripheral limbs.,Neurological:  From neurological standpoint, her cranial nerves were grossly intact throughout.  Her strength was good in the bilateral upper and lower extremities without any distal to proximal variation.  Her overall resting tone was normal.  Sensory examination was grossly intact to light touch throughout the upper and lower extremities.  Reflexes were 1+ in bilateral patella.  Toes were downgoing bilaterally.  Coordination showed accurate striking ability and good rapid alternating movements.  Gait examination was deferred at this time due to EEG lead placement.,ASSESSMENT:,  A 2-1/2-year-old female with history of febrile seizures, now with concern for spells of unclear etiology, but somewhat concerning for partial complex seizures and to a slightly lesser extent nonconvulsive generalized seizures.,RECOMMENDATIONS,1.  For now, we will go ahead and try to capture EEG as long as she tolerates it; however, if she would require sedation, I would defer the EEG until further adjustments to seizure medications are made and we will see her response to these medications.,2.  As per the above, I will increase her Keppra to 300 mg p.o. b.i.d. bringing her to a total daily dose of just under 40 mg/kg per day.  If further spells are noted, we may increase upwards again to around 4.5 to 5 mL each day.,3.  I do not feel like any specific imaging needs to be done at this time until we see her response to the medication and review her EEG findings.  EEG, hopefully, will be able to be reviewed first thing tomorrow morning; however, I would not delay discharge the patient to wait on the EEG results.  The patient has been discharged and we will contact the family as an outpatient.,4.  The patient will need followup arrangement with me in 5 to 6 weeks' time, so we may recheck and see how she is doing and arrange for further followup then.",

", Neurology,3, Neuropsychological Evaluation - 5 ,"PROBLEMS AND ISSUES:,1.  Headaches, nausea, and dizziness, consistent with a diagnosis of vestibular migraine, recommend amitriptyline for prophylactic treatment and Motrin for abortive treatment.,2.  Some degree of peripheral neuropathy, consistent with diabetic neuropathy, encouraged her to watch her diet and exercise daily.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient comes in for a neurology consultation regarding her difficult headaches, tunnel vision, and dizziness.  I obtained and documented a full history and physical examination.  I reviewed the new patient questionnaire, which she completed prior to her arrival today.  I also reviewed the results of tests, which she had brought with her.,Briefly, she is a 60-year-old woman initially from Ukraine, who had headaches since age 25.  She recalls that in 1996 when her husband died her headaches became more frequent.  They were pulsating.  She was given papaverine, which was successful in reducing the severity of her symptoms.  After six months of taking papaverine, she no longer had any headaches.  In 2004, her headaches returned.  She also noted that she had ""zig-zag lines"" in her vision.  Sometimes she would not see things in her peripheral visions.  She had photophobia and dizziness, which was mostly lightheadedness.  On one occasion she almost had a syncope.  Again she has started taking Russian medications, which did help her.  The dizziness and headaches have become more frequent and now occur on average once to twice per week.  They last two hours since she takes papaverine, which stops the symptoms within 30 minutes.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: ,Her past medical history is significant for injury to her left shoulder, gastroesophageal reflux disorder, diabetes, anxiety, and osteoporosis.,MEDICATIONS:,  Her medications include hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, glipizide, metformin, vitamin D, Centrum multivitamin tablets, Actos, lorazepam as needed, Vytorin, and Celexa.,ALLERGIES: , She has no known drug allergies.,FAMILY HISTORY:  ,There is family history of migraine and diabetes in her siblings.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , She drinks alcohol occasionally.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , Her review of systems was significant for headaches, pain in her left shoulder, sleeping problems and gastroesophageal reflex symptoms.  Remainder of her full 14-point review of system was unremarkable.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,  On examination, the patient was pleasant.  She was able to speak English fairly well.  Her blood pressure was 130/84.  Heart rate was 80.  Respiratory rate was 16.  Her weight was 188 pounds.  Her pain score was 0/10.  Her general exam was completely unremarkable.  Her neurological examination showed subtle weakness in her left arm due to discomfort and pain.  She had reduced vibration sensation in her left ankle and to some degree in her right foot.  There was no ataxia.  She was able to walk normally.  Reflexes were 2+ throughout.,She had had a CT scan with constant, which per Dr. X's was unremarkable.  She reports that she had a brain MRI two years ago which was also unremarkable.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN:,  The patient is a delightful 60-year-old chemist from Ukraine who has had episodes of headaches with nausea, photophobia, and dizziness since her 20s.  She has had some immigration problems in recent months and has experienced increased frequency of her migraine symptoms.  Her diagnosis is consistent with vestibular migraine.  I do not see evidence of multiple sclerosis, M√©ni√®re's disease, or benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.,I talked to her in detail about the importance of following a migraine diet.  I gave her instructions including a list of foods times, which worsen migraine.  I reviewed this information for more than half the clinic visit.  I would like to start her on amitriptyline at a dose of 10 mg at time.  She will take Motrin at a dose of 800 mg as needed for her severe headaches.,She will make a diary of her migraine symptoms so that we can find any triggering food items, which worsen her symptoms.  I encouraged her to walk daily in order to improve her fitness, which helps to reduce migraine symptoms.","neurology, nausea, dizziness, migraine, peripheral neuropathy, diabetic neuropathy, neuropathy, positional vertigo, photophobia and dizziness, neurology consultation, tunnel vision, vestibular migraine, migraine symptoms, headaches, photophobia, ataxia, "
175,379,2802," Patient has trouble with walking and balance, with bladder control, and with thinking and memory.", Neurology,3, Neurologic Consultation - 2 ,"REASON FOR VISIT:  ,The patient is a 76-year-old man referred for neurological consultation by Dr. X.  The patient is companied to clinic today by his wife and daughter.  He provides a small portion of his history; however, his family provides virtually all of it.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , He has trouble with walking and balance, with bladder control, and with thinking and memory.  When I asked him to provide me detail, he could not tell me much more than the fact that he has trouble with his walking and that he has trouble with his bladder.  He is vaguely aware that he has trouble with his memory.,According to his family, he has had difficulty with his gait for at least three or four years.  At first, they thought it was weakness and because of he was on the ground (for example, gardening) he was not able to get up by himself.  They did try stopping the statin that he was taking at that time, but because there was no improvement over two weeks, they resumed the statin.  As time progressed, he developed more and more difficulty.  He started to shuffle.  He started using a cane about two and a half years ago and has used a walker with wheels in the front since July of 2006.  At this point, he frequently if not always has trouble getting in or out of the seat.  He frequently tends to lean backwards or sideways when sitting.  He frequently if not always has trouble getting in or out a car, always shuffles or scuffs his feet, always has trouble turning or changing direction, always has trouble with uneven surfaces or curbs, and always has to hold on to someone or something when walking.  He has not fallen in the last month.  He did fall earlier, but there seemed to be fewer opportunities for him to fall.  His family has recently purchased a lightweight wheelchair to use if he is traveling long distances.  He has no stairs in his home, however, his family indicates that he would not be able to take stairs.  His handwriting has become smaller and shakier.,In regard to the bladder, he states, ""I wet the bed.""  In talking with his family, it seems as if he has no warning that he needs to empty his bladder.  He was diagnosed with a small bladder tumor in 2005.  This was treated by Dr. Y.  Dr. X does not think that the bladder tumor has anything to do with the patient's urinary incontinence.  The patient has worn a pad or undergarment for at least one to one and a half years.  His wife states that they go through two or three of them per day.  He has been placed on medications; however, they have not helped.,He has no headaches or sensation of head fullness.,In regard to the thinking and memory, at first he seemed forgetful and had trouble with dates.  Now he seems less spontaneous and his family states he seems to have trouble expressing himself.  His wife took over his medications about two years ago.  She stopped his driving about three years ago.  She discovered that his license had been expired for about a year and she was concerned enough at that time that she told him he could drive no more.  Apparently, he did not object.  At this point, he frequently has trouble with memory, orientation, and everyday problems solving at home.  He needs coaching for his daily activities such as reminders to brush his teeth, put on his clothes, and so forth.  He is a retired office machine repairman.  He is currently up and active about 12 hours a day and sleeping or lying down about 12 hours per day.,He has not had PT or OT and has not been treated with medications for Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease.  He has been treated for the bladder.  He has not had lumbar puncture.,Past medical history and review of all 14 systems from the form they completed for this visit that I reviewed with them is negative with the exception that he has had hypertension since 1985, hypercholesterolemia since 1997, and diabetes since 1998.  The bladder tumor was discovered in 2005 and was treated noninvasively.  He has lost weight from about 200 pounds to 180 pounds over the last two or three years.  He had a period of depression in 1999 and was on Prozac for a while, but this was then stopped.  He used to drink a significant amount of alcohol.  This was problematic enough that his wife was concerned.  She states he stopped when she retired and she was at home all day.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,He quit smoking in 1968.  His current weight is 183 pounds.  His tallest height is 5 feet 10 inches.,FAMILY HISTORY:  ,His grandfather had arthritis.  His father had Parkinson's disease.  His mother had heart disease and a sister has diabetes.,He does not have a Living Will and indicates he would wish his wife to make decisions for him if he could not make them for himself.,REVIEW OF HYDROCEPHALUS RISK FACTORS: , None.,ALLERGIES: , None.,MEDICATIONS: , Metformin 500 mg three times a day, Lipitor 10 mg per day, lisinopril 20 mg per day, metoprolol 50 mg per day, Uroxatral 10 mg per day, Detrol LA 4 mg per day, and aspirin 81 mg per day.,PHYSICAL EXAM: , On examination today, this is a pleasant 76-year-old man who is guided back from the clinic waiting area walking with his walker.  He is well developed, well nourished, and kempt.,Vital Signs:  His weight is 180 pounds.,Head:  The head is normocephalic and atraumatic.  The head circumference is 59 cm, which is the ,75-90th percentile for an adult man whose height is 178 cm.,Spine:  The spine is straight and not tender.  I can easily palpate the spinous processes.  There is no scoliosis.,Skin:  No neurocutaneous stigmata.,Cardiovascular Examination:  No carotid or vertebral bruits.,Mental Status:  Assessed for orientation, recent and remote memory, attention span, concentration, language, and fund of knowledge.  The Mini-Mental State Exam score was 17/30.  He did not know the year, season, or day of the week nor did he know the building or specialty or the floor.  There was a tendency for perseveration during the evaluation.  He could not copy the diagram of intersecting pentagons.,Cranial Nerve Exam:  No evidence of papilledema.  The pupillary light reflex is intact as are extraocular movements without nystagmus, facial expression and sensation, hearing, head turning, tongue, and palate movement.,Motor Exam:  Normal bulk and strength, but the tone is marked by significant paratonia.  There is no atrophy, fasciculations, or drift.  There is tremulousness of the outstretched hands.,Sensory Exam:  Is difficult to interpret.  Either he does not understand the test or he is mostly guessing.,Cerebellar Exam:  Is intact for finger-to-nose, heel-to-knee, and rapid alternating movement tests.  There is no dysarthria.,Reflexes:  Trace in the arms, 2+ at the knees, and 0 at the ankles.  It is not certain whether there is a Babinski sign or simply withdrawal.,Gait:  Assessed using the Tinetti assessment tool that shows a balance score of 7-10/16 and a gait score of 2-5/12 for a total score of 9-15/28, which is significantly impaired.,REVIEW OF X-RAYS: , I personally reviewed the MRI scan of the brain from December 11, 2007 at Advanced Radiology.  It shows the ventricles are enlarged with a frontal horn span of 5.0 cm.  The 3rd ventricle contour is flat.  The span is enlarged at 12 mm.  The sylvian aqueduct is patent.  There is a pulsation artifact.  The corpus callosum is effaced.  There are extensive T2 signal abnormalities that are confluent in the corona radiata.  There are also scattered T2 abnormalities in the basal ganglia.  There is a suggestion of hippocampal atrophy.  There is also a suggestion of vermian atrophy.,ASSESSMENT: , The patient has a clinical syndrome that raises the question of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus.  His examination today is notable for moderate-to-severe dementia and moderate-to-severe gait impairment.  His MRI scan raises the question of hydrocephalus, however, is also consistent with cerebral small vessel disease.,PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES:,1.  Possible idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (331.5).,2.  Probable cerebral small-vessel disease (290.40 & 438).,3.  Gait impairment (781.2).,4.  Urinary urgency and incontinence (788.33).,5.  Dementia.,6.  Hypertension.,7.  Hypercholesterolemia.",
176,380,2803, The patient is a 55-year-old gentleman who presents for further evaluation of right leg weakness., Neurology,3, Neuro Consult - Leg Weakness ,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 55-year-old gentleman who presents for further evaluation of right leg weakness.  He has difficulty recollecting the exact details and chronology of his problem.  To the best of his recollection, he thinks that about six months ago he developed weakness of his right leg.  He describes that he is reaching to get something from a cabinet and he noticed that he was unable to stand on his right toe.  Since that time, he has had difficulty pushing off when he walks.  He has mild tingling and numbness in his toes, but this has been a chronic problem and nothing new since he has developed the weakness.  He has chronic mild back pain, but this has been persistent for many years and has not changed.  He has experienced cramps in both calves for the past year.  This dissipated about two months ago.  He does not think that his left leg is weak.  He does not have any bowel or bladder incontinence.  There is no radicular pain.  He does not think that the problem is progressive, meaning that the weakness that he perceives in his right leg is no different than when it was six months ago.,He first sought medical attention for this problem in October.  He then saw you a couple of months later.  He has undergone an EMG and nerve conduction studies.  Unfortunately, he cannot undergo an MRI of his spine because he has an ear implant.  He has had a CT scan that shows degenerative changes, but nothing obviously abnormal.,In addition, the patient has hyperCKemia.  He tells me that he has had an elevated CK prior to starting taking stat medications, although this is not entirely clear to me.  He thinks that he is not taking Lipitor for about 15 months and thought that his CK was in the 500 or 600s prior to starting it.  Once it was started, it increased to about 800 and then came down to about 500 when it was stopped.  He then had a recent bump again up to the 1000 and since Lipitor has been stopped, his CK apparently has returned to about the 500 or 600s.  I do no have any laboratory data to support these statements by the patient, but he seems to be up to speed on this.  More recently, he has been started taking Zetia.  He does not have any proximal weakness.  He denies any myalgias., ,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  He has coronary artery disease and has received five stents.  He has hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.  He states that he was diagnosed with diabetes based on the results of an abnormal oral glucose tolerance test.  He believes that his glucose shot up to over 300 with this testing.  He does not take any medications for this and his blood glucoses are generally normal when he checks it.  He has had plastic surgery on his face from an orbital injury.  He also had an ear graft when he developed an ear infection during his honeymoon., ,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:, He takes amlodipine, Diovan, Zetia, hydrochlorothiazide, Lovaza (fish oil), Niaspan, aspirin, and Chantix.  , ,ALLERGIES:,  He has no known drug allergies., ,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  He lives with his wife.  He works at Shepherd Pratt doing network engineering.  He smokes a pack of cigarettes a day and is working on quitting.  He drinks four alcoholic beverages per night.  Prior to that, he drank significantly more.  He denies illicit drug use.  He was athletic growing up., ,FAMILY HISTORY:,  His mother died of complications from heart disease.  His father died of heart disease in his 40s.  He has two living brothers.  One of them he does not speak too much with and does not know about his medical history.  The other is apparently healthy.  He has one healthy child.  His maternal uncles apparently had polio.  When I asked him to tell me further details about this, he states that one of them had to wear crutches due to severe leg deformans and then the other had leg deformities in only one leg.  He is fairly certain that they had polio.  He is unaware of any other family members with neurological conditions.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , He has occasional tinnitus.  He has difficulty sleeping.  Otherwise, a complete review of systems was obtained and was negative except for as mentioned above.  This is documented in the handwritten notes from today's visit.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:, ,Vital Signs:",
177,381,2804, Neurologic consultation was requested to assess and assist with seizure medication., Neurology,3, Neurologic Consultation - 3 ,"HISTORY: , Neurologic consultation was requested to assess and assist with her seizure medication.  The patient is a 3-year 3 months old girl with refractory epilepsy.  She had been previously followed by XYZ, but has been under the care of the UCSF epilepsy program and recently by Dr. Y.  I reviewed her pertinent previous neurology evaluations at CHCC and also interviewed mom.,The patient had seizure breakthrough in August 2007, which requires inpatient admission, Thanksgiving and then after that time had seizures every other day, up-to-date early December.  She remained seizure-free until 12/25/2007 when she had a breakthrough seizure at home treated with Diastat.  She presented to our ER today with prolonged convulsive seizure despite receiving 20 mg of Diastat at home.  Mom documented 103 temperature at home.  In the ER, this was 101 to 102 degrees Fahrenheit.  I reviewed the ER notes.  At 0754 hours, she was having intermittent generalized tonic-clonic seizures despite receiving a total of 1.5 mg of lorazepam x5.  UCSF fellow was contacted.  She was given additional fosphenytoin and had a total dose of 15 mg/kg administered.  Vital weight was 27.  Seizures apparently had stopped.  The valproic acid level obtained at 0835 hours was 79.  According to mom, her last dose was at 6 p.m. and she did not receive her morning dose.  Other labs slightly showed leukocytosis with white blood cell count 21,000 and normal CMP.,Previous workup here showed an EEG on 2005, which showed a left posterior focus.  MRI on June 2007 and January 2005 were within normal limits.  Mom describes the following seizure types:,1.  Eye blinking with unresponsiveness.,2.  Staring off to one side.,3.  Focal motor activity in one arm and recently generalized tonic seizure.,She also said that she was supposed to see Dr. Y this Friday, but had postponed it to some subsequent time when results of genetic testing would be available.  She was being to physicians' care as Dr. Z had previously being following her last UCSF.,She had failed most of the first and second line anti-epileptic drugs.  These include Keppra, Lamictal, Trileptal, phenytoin and phenobarbital.  These are elicited to allergies, but she has not had any true allergic reactions to these.  Actually, it has resulted in an allergic reaction resulting in rash and hypotension.,She also had been treated with Clobazam.  Her best control is with her current regimen of valproic acid and Tranxene.  Other attempts to taper Topamax, but this resulted increased seizures.  She also has oligohidrosis during this summertime.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Include Diastat 20 mg; Topamax 25 mg b.i.d., which is 3.3 per kilo per day; Tranxene 15 mg b.i.d.; Depakote 125 mg t.i.d., which is 25 per kilo per day.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS:  Weight 15 kg.,GENERAL:  The patient was awake, she appeared sedated and postictal.,NECK:  Supple.,NEUROLOGICAL:  She had a few brief myoclonic jerks of her legs during drowsiness, but otherwise no overt seizure, no seizure activity nor involuntary movements were observed.,She was able to follow commands such as when I request that she gave mom a kiss.  She acknowledged her doll.  Left fundus is sharp.  She resisted the rest of the exam.  There was no obvious lateralized findings.,ASSESSMENT:,  Status epilepticus resolved.  Triggered by a febrile illness, possibly viral.  Refractory remote symptomatic partial epilepsy.,IMPRESSION: , I discussed the maximizing Depakote to mom and she concurred.  I recommend increasing her maintenance dose to one in the morning, one in the day, and two at bedtime.  For today, she did give an IV Depacon 250 mg and the above dosage can be continued IV until she is taking p.o.  Dr. X agreed with the changes and orders were written for this.  She can continue her current doses of Topamax and Tranxene.  This can be given by NG if needed.  Topamax can be potentially increased to 25 mg in the morning and 50 mg at night.  I will be available as needed during the rest of her hospitalization.  Mom will call contact Dr. Y an update him about the recent changes.","neurology, eye blinking, status epilepticus, seizure medication, valproic acid, allergic reactions, neurologic consultation, seizure, neurologic, seizures,"

She states that she is compliant with her medications and has had a normal sleep-wake cycle.,Looking back through her notes, she initially responded very well to Keppra, but did have a breakthrough seizure on Keppra.  This was thought secondary to severe insomnia when her baby was very young.  Because she tolerated the medication well and it was at least partially affective, I have recommended adding Keppra 500 mg b.i.d.  Side effect profile of this medication was discussed with the patient.,I will see in followup in three months.","neurology, generalized tonic-clonic seizure, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, tonic clonic seizure, myoclonic epilepsy, tonic clonic, juvenile, myoclonus, epilepsy, myoclonic, seizure"

180,384,2807, , Neurology,3, Neuro Consult - Depression & Dementia ,"Subsequently, the patient developed a moderately severe depression.  She was tried on various medications, which caused sweating, nightmares and perhaps other side effects.  She was finally put on Effexor 25 mg two tablets h.s. and trazodone 100 mg h.s., and has done fairly well, although she still has significant depression.,Her daughter brought her in today to be sure that she does not have dementia.  There is no history of memory loss.  There is no history of focal neurologic symptoms or significant headaches.,The patient's complaints, according to the daughter, include not wanted to go out in public, shamed regarding her appearance (25-pound weight loss over the past year), eating poorly, not doing things unless asked, hiding food to prevent having to eat it, nervousness, and not taking a shower.  She has no focal neurologic deficits.  She does complain of constipation.

His neurological examination is notable for sensory loss in a length-dependent fashion in his feet and legs with scant fasciculations in his calves.", Neurology,3, Multiple Neurological Symptoms ,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 63-year-old left-handed gentleman who presents for further evaluation of multiple neurological symptoms.  I asked him to discuss each symptom individually as he had a very hard time describing the nature of his problems.  He first mentioned that he has neck pain.  He states that he has had this for at least 15 years.  It is worse with movement.  It has progressed very slowly over the course of 15 years.  It is localized to the base of his neck and is sharp in quality.  He also endorses a history of gait instability.  This has been present for a few years and has been slightly progressively worsening.  He describes that he feels unsteady on his feet and ""walks like a duck.""  He has fallen about three or four times over the past year and a half.,He also describes that he has numbness in his feet.  When I asked him to describe this in more detail, the numbness is actually restricted to his toes.  Left is slightly more affected than the right.  He denies any tingling or paresthesias.  He also described that he is slowly losing control of his hands.  He thinks that he is dropping objects due to weakness or incoordination in his hands.  This has also been occurring for the past one to two years.  He has noticed that buttoning his clothes is more difficult for him.  He also does not have any numbness or tingling in the hands.  He does have a history of chronic low back pain.,At the end of the visit, when I asked him which symptom was most bothersome to him, he actually stated that his fatigue was most troublesome.  He did not even mention this on the initial part of my history taking.  When I asked him to describe this further, he states that he experiences a general exhaustion.  He basically lays in bed all day everyday.  I asked him if he was depressed, he states that he is treated for depression.  He is unsure if this is optimally treated.  As I just mentioned, he stays in bed almost all day long and does not engage in any social activities.  He does not think that he is necessarily sad.  His appetite is good.  He has never undergone any psychotherapy for depression.,When I took his history, I noticed that he is very slow in responding to my questions and also had a lot of difficulty recalling details of his history as well as names of physicians who he had seen in the past.  I asked if he had ever been evaluated for cognitive difficulties and he states that he did undergo testing at Johns Hopkins a couple of years ago.  He states that the results were normal and that specifically he did not have any dementia.,When I asked him when he was first evaluated for his current symptoms, he states that he saw Dr. X several years ago.  He believes that he was told that he had neuropathy but that it was unclear if it was due to his diabetes.  He told me that more recently he was evaluated by you after Dr. Y referred him for this evaluation.  He also saw Dr. Z for neurosurgical consultation a couple of weeks ago.  He reports that she did not think there was any surgical indication in his neck or back at this point in time.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , He has had diabetes for five years.  He also has had hypercholesterolemia.  He has had Crohn's disease for 25 or 30 years.  He has had a colostomy for four years.  He has arthritis, which is reportedly related to the Crohn's disease.  He has hypertension and coronary artery disease and is status post stent placement.  He has depression.  He had a kidney stone removed about 25 years ago.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , He takes Actos, Ambien, baby aspirin, Coreg, Entocort, folic acid, Flomax, iron, Lexapro 20 mg q.h.s., Lipitor, Pentasa, Plavix, Protonix, Toprol, Celebrex and Zetia.,ALLERGIES: , He states that Imuran caused him to develop tachycardia.,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  He previously worked with pipeline work, but has been on disability for five years.  He is unsure which symptoms led him to go on disability.  He has previously smoked about two packs of cigarettes daily for 20 years, but quit about 20 years ago.  He denies alcohol or illicit drug use.  He lives with his wife.  He does not really have any hobbies.,FAMILY HISTORY: , His father died of a cerebral hemorrhage at age 49.  His mother died in her 70s from complications of congestive heart failure.  He has one sister who died during a cardiac surgery two years ago.  He has another sister with diabetes.  He has one daughter with hypercholesterolemia.  He is unaware of any family members with neurological disorders.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , He has dyspnea on exertion.  He states that he was evaluated by a pulmonologist and had a normal evaluation.  He has occasional night sweats.  His hearing is poor.  He occasionally develops bloody stools, which he attributes to his Crohn's disease.  He also was diagnosed with sleep apnea.  He does not wear his CPAP machine on a regular basis.  He has a history of anemia.  Otherwise, a complete review of systems was obtained and was negative except for as mentioned above.  This is documented in the handwritten notes from today's visit.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,Vital Signs:  Blood pressure 160/86 HR 100 RR 16 Wt 211 pounds Pain 3/10,General Appearance:  He is well appearing in no acute distress.  He has somewhat of a flat affect.,Cardiovascular:  He has a regular rhythm without murmurs, gallops, or rubs.  There are no carotid bruits.,Chest:  The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.,Skin:  There are no rashes or lesions.,Musculoskeletal:  He has no joint deformities or scoliosis.,NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION:,Mental Status:  His speech is fluent without dysarthria or aphasia.  He is alert and oriented to name, place, and date.  Attention, concentration, and fund of knowledge are intact.  He has 3/3 object registration and 1/3 recall in 5 minutes.,Cranial Nerves:  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.  Visual fields are full.  Optic discs are normal.  Extraocular movements are intact without nystagmus.  Facial sensation is normal.  There is no facial, jaw, palate, or tongue weakness.  Hearing is grossly intact.  Shoulder shrug is full.,Motor:  He has normal muscle bulk and tone.  There is no atrophy.  He has few fasciculations in his calf muscles bilaterally.  Manual muscle testing reveals MRC grade 5/5 strength in all proximal and distal muscles of the upper and lower extremities.  There is no action or percussion myotonia or paramyotonia.,Sensory:  He has absent vibratory sensation at the left toe.  This is diminished at the right toe.  Joint position sense is intact.  There is diminished sensation to light touch and temperature at the feet to the knees bilaterally.  Pinprick is intact.  Romberg is absent.  There is no spinal sensory level.,Coordination:  This is intact by finger-nose-finger or heel-to-shin testing.  He does have a slight tremor of the head and outstretched arms.,Deep Tendon Reflexes:  They are 2+ at the biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, patellas, and ankles.  Plantar reflexes are flexor.  There is no ankle clonus, finger flexors, or Hoffman's signs.  He has crossed adductors bilaterally.,Gait and Stance:  He has a slightly wide-based gait.  He has some difficulty with toe walking, but he is able to walk on his heels and tandem walk.  He has difficulty with toe raises on the left.,RADIOLOGIC DATA: , MRI of the cervical spine, 09/30/08:  Chronic spondylosis at C5-C6 causing severe bilateral neuroforamining and borderline-to-mold cord compression with normal cord signal.

His neurological examination is notable for sensory loss in a length-dependent fashion in his feet and legs with scant fasciculations in his calves.  He has fairly normal or very mild increased reflexes including notably the presence of normal ankle jerks.,I think that the etiology of his symptoms is multifactorial.  He probably does have a mild peripheral neuropathy, but the sparing of ankle jerks suggested either the neuropathy is mild or that there is a superimposed myelopathic process such as a cervical or lumbosacral myelopathy.  He really is most concerned about the fatigue and I think it is possible due to suboptimally treated depression and suboptimally treated sleep apnea.  Whether he has another underlying muscular disorder such as a primary myopathy remains to be seen.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,1.  I scheduled him for repeat EMG and nerve conduction studies to evaluate for evidence of neuropathy or myopathy.,2.  I will review his films at our spine conference tomorrow although I am confident in Dr. Z's opinion that there is no surgical indication.,3.  I gave him a prescription for physical therapy to help with gait imbalance training as well as treatment for his neck pain.,4.  I believe that he needs to undergo psychotherapy for his depression.  It may also be worthwhile to adjust his medications, but I will defer to his primary care physician for managing this or for referring him to a therapist.  The patient is very open about proceeding with this suggestion.,5.  He does need to have his sleep apnea better controlled.  He states that he is not compliant because the face mask that he uses does not fit him well.  This should also be addressed.",

This is a malignant meningioma by diagnosis.,ASSESSMENT/PLAN: , In summary, Mr. A has significant disability and is not independent currently.  I believe that because of this that the likelihood of benefit from surgery is small and there is a very good chance that he would not be able to recover from surgery.  I do not think that surgery will help his quality of life and a need to control the tumor would be dependent on another therapy impacting the tumor.  Given that there are not good therapies and chemotherapy would be the option at the moment, and he certainly is not in a condition where chemotherapy would be given, I believe that surgery would not be in his best interest.  I discussed this both with him, although it is not clear to me how much he understood, as well as his family.","neurology, seizures, hemiparesis, tumor, seizures hemiparesis, malignant meningioma, chemotherapy, malignant, meningioma, aspirin"

He presented with eight to ten years of progressive gait impairment, cognitive impairment, and decreased bladder control.  We established a diagnosis of adult hydrocephalus with the spinal catheter protocol in June of 2008 and ,Mr. A underwent shunt surgery performed by Dr. X on August 1st.  A Medtronic Strata programmable shunt in the ventriculoperitoneal configuration programmed at level 2.0 was placed.,Mr. A comes today with his daughter, Pam and together they give his history.,Mr. A has had no hospitalizations or other illnesses since I last saw him.  With respect to his walking, his daughter tells me that he is now able to walk to the dining room just fine, but could not before his surgery.  His balance has improved though he still has some walking impairment.  With respect to his bladder, initially there was some improvement, but he has leveled off and he wears a diaper.,With respect to his cognition, both Pam and the patient say that his thinking has improved.  The other daughter, Patty summarized it best according to two of them.  She said, ""I feel like I can have a normal conversation with him again.""  Mr. A has had no headaches and no pain at the shunt site or at the abdomen.,MEDICATIONS: , Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d., metoprolol 25 mg p.o. q.d., Flomax 0.4 mg p.o. q.d., Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.d., Detrol LA 4 mg p.o. q.d., lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d., Imodium daily, Omega-3, fish oil, and Lasix.,MAJOR FINDINGS:,  Mr. A is a pleasant and cooperative man who is able to converse easily though his daughter adds some details.,Vital Signs:  Blood pressure 124/80, heart rate is 64, respiratory rate is 18, weight 174 pounds, and pain is 0/10.,The shunt site was clean, dry, and intact and confirmed at a setting of 2.0.,Mental Status:  Tested for recent and remote memory, attention span, concentration, and fund of knowledge.  He scored 26/30 on the MMSE when tested with spelling and 25/30 when tested with calculations.  Of note, he was able to get two of the three memory words with cuing and the third one with multiple choice.  This was a slight improvement over his initial score of 23/30 with calculations and 24/30 with spelling and at that time he was unable to remember any memory words with cuing and only one with multiple choice.,Gait:  Tested using the Tinetti assessment tool.  He was tested without an assistive device and received a gait score of 6-8/12 and a balance of score of 12/16 for a total score of 18-20/28.  This has slightly improved from his initial score of 15-17/28.,Cranial Nerves:  Pupils are equal.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Face symmetric.  No dysarthria.,Motor:  Normal for bulk and strength.,Coordination:  Slow for finger-to-nose.,IMAGING: , CT scan was reviewed from 10/15/2008.  It shows a frontal horn span at the level of foramen of Munro of 4.6 cm with a 3rd ventricular contour that is flat with the span of 10 mm.  By my reading, there is a tiny amount of blood in the right frontal region with just a tiny subdural collection.  This was not noticed by the radiologist who stated no extraaxial fluid collections.  There is also substantial small vessel ischemic change.,ASSESSMENT: , Mr. A has made some improvement since shunt surgery.,PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES:,1.  Adult hydrocephalus (331.5).,2.  Gait impairment (781.2).,3.  Urinary incontinence and urgency (788.33).,4.  Cognitive impairment (290.0).,PLAN:,  I had a long discussion with Mr. A and his daughter.  We are all pleased that he has started to make some improvement with his hydrocephalus because I believe I see a tiny fluid collection in the right parietal region, I would like to leave the setting at 2.0 for another three months before we consider changing the shunt.  I do not believe that this tiny amount of fluid is symptotic and it was not documented by the radiologist when he read the CT scan.,Mr. A asked me about whether he will be able to drive again.  Unfortunately, I think it is unlikely that his speed of movement will improve to a level that he will be able to pass a driver's safety evaluation, however, occasionally patients surprise me by improving enough over 9 to 12 months that they are able to pass such a test.  I would certainly be happy to recommend such a test if I believe ,Mr. A is likely to pass it and he is always welcome to enroll in a driver's safety program without my recommendation, however, I think it is exceeding unlikely that he has the capability of passing this rigorous test at this time.  I also think it is quite likely he will not regain sufficient speed of motion to pass such a test.",

212,420,2891, Electroencephalographic findings and interpretation, Neurology,3, Electroencephalography ,"HISTORY:, This is a digital EEG performed on a 75-year-old male with seizures.,BACKGROUND ACTIVITY:, The background activity consists of a 8 Hz to 9 Hz rhythm arising in the posterior head region. This rhythm is also accompanied by some beta activity which occurs infrequently. There are also muscle contractions occurring at 4 Hz to 5 Hz which suggests possible Parkinson's. Part of the EEG is obscured by the muscle contraction artifact. There are also left temporal sharps occurring infrequently during the tracing. At one point of time, there was some slowing occurring in the right frontal head region.,ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:, Photic stimulation was performed and did not show any significant abnormality.,SLEEP PATTERNS:, No sleep architecture was observed during this tracing.,IMPRESSION:, This awake/alert/drowsy EEG is abnormal due to the presence of slowing in the right frontal head region, due to the presence of sharps arising in the left temporal head region, and due to the tremors. The slowing can be consistent with underlying structural abnormalities, so a stroke, subdural hematoma, etc., should be ruled out. The tremor probably represents a Parkinson's tremor and the sharps arising in the left temporal head region can potentially give way to seizures or may also represent underlying structural abnormalities, so clinical correlation is recommended.","neurology, electroencephalography, eeg, hz rhythm, parkinson's tremor, photic stimulation, frontal head region, temporal head region, muscle contractions, seizures, parkinson's, temporal, "

He states that he was in his usual state of health when he awoke one morning in January 2009.  He had double vision.  He states when he closed each eye, the double vision dissipated.  The double vision entirely dissipated within one hour.  He was able to drive.  However, the next day he woke up and he had double vision again.  Over the next week, the double vision worsened in intensity and frequency and by the second week, it was severe.  He states that he called Sinai Hospital and spoke to a physician who recommended that he come in for evaluation.  He was seen by a primary care physician who sent him for an ophthalmologic evaluation.  He was seen and referred to the emergency department for an urgent MRI to evaluate for possible aneurysm.  The patient states that he had a normal MRI and was discharged to home.,For the next month, the double vision improved, although he currently still experiences constant diplopia.  Whereas in the past, when he would see two objects, they were very far apart in a horizontal plane; now they are much closer together.  He still does not drive.  He also is not working due to the double vision.  There is no temporal fluctuation to the double vision.  More recently, over the past month, he has developed right supraorbital pain.  It actually feels like there is pain under his right lid.

MRV was negative and MRI of the brain with and without contrast was also negative.  He also had an MRI of the orbit with and without contrast that was normal.  His impression was that the patient should follow up for a possible evaluation of myasthenia gravis or other disorder.,At the time of the examination, it was documented that he had right lid ptosis.  He had left gaze diplopia.  The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.  His neurological examination was otherwise entirely normal.  According to Dr. X's note, the ophthalmologist who saw him thought that there was ptosis of the right eye as well as an abnormal pupil.  There was also right medial rectus as well as possibly other extraocular abnormalities.

The nature of this lesion is unclear.  Certainly, this abnormality would not explain her left facial twitching and is unlikely to be involved with the right posterior sensory changes she experiences.,LABS: , She was supposed to have Lyme titers and thyroid tests as well as fasting glucose, which were not done; however, in light of her improvement these may not need to be performed at this time.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Left facial twitching-appears to be improving.  Most likely, this is a peripheral nerve injury related to her abscess as previously described.  In light of her negative MRI and clinical improvement, we discussed options and elected to just observe for now.,2.  Posterior pressure like headache, also appears to be improving.  The etiology is unclear, but as it responds nicely to nonsteroidal antiinflammatories and is decreasing, no further evaluation is needed.,3.  Probable circadian sleep disorder related to her nighttime work schedule and awakening at 9.00 a.m. with insufficient sleep.  There is also the possibility of consistent obstructive sleep apnea and if symptoms worsen then we should consider doing a sleep study.  For the time being, sleep hygiene measures were discussed with the patient including trying to sleep later at least till 10.00 a.m. or 10.30 to get a full-night sleep.  She is on vacation next week and is going to try to see if this will help.  We also discussed as before weight loss and exercise, which could be helpful.,4.

She saw a urologist and underwent urodynamic testing.  She was diagnosed as having ""overactive bladder"", but the cause of this was never determined.  She was treated with medications, possibly Ditropan, without much benefit.  She also developed a dry mouth from the medication and so she discontinued it.,Also in about 1993, she began to note an uncomfortable ""stiffness"" in her feet and slight swelling of the ankles.  Apparently, the swelling was not visible by others.  She saw multiple physicians and was told that it was ""not arthritis"", but no definite diagnosis was ever established.  She saw at least two rheumatologists on several occasions and blood tests were all normal.  No clear-cut diagnosis was ever made and the patient simply learned to live with these symptoms.,However, over time she noted that the symptoms in her legs seemed to worsen somewhat.  She states from time-to-time she could ""barely walk"".  She felt as if her balance is impaired and she felt as if she were ""walking on stilts"".  She tried arch supports from a podiatrist without any benefit.  She began to tire more easily when walking.,In 2002 she was seen by a podiatrist, who noticed an abnormal gait and recommended that she see a neurologist.,In the fall of 2002, she was seen by Dr. X.  He ordered an MRI scan of her brain and lumbar spine.  He also did some sort of nerve testing and possibly visual evoked response testing.  After reviewing everything, he diagnosed multiple sclerosis.  However, prior to starting her on immunomodulatory therapy, he referred her for a second opinion to Dr. Y, in January of 2003.  Dr. Y confirmed the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.,The patient then returned to Dr. X and was started on Avonex.  She continued on it for about six months.  However, it made her feel much more stiff and delayed and so she finally stopped it.  She also recalled being tried on baclofen by Dr. X, but again it did not benefit her and made her feel slightly dizzy.  So, she discontinued it also.,At that point in time, she decided to try a program of ""good nutrition, vitamin supplements, and fish oil"".,In December 2004 and extending up to February 2005, she began to note progressively more severe swelling and stiffness in the distal lower extremities.  She began to have to use a cane.  She was seen in neurological consultation by Dr. Z.  She was treated with a Medrol Dosepak.  Her spasticity and swelling seemed to improve dramatically.  However, within about two weeks symptoms were back to baseline.,She was then treated with intravenous Solu-Medrol 500 mg daily for five days followed by a prednisone or Medrol taper (July 2005).  This seemed to be less helpful than the oral steroids, but was partially beneficial.  However, it wore off once again.,A repeat MRI scan of the brain in April 2005 was said to ""look better"".  She was started on Zanaflex for her lower extremity spasticity without benefit.,Finally six days ago, she was restarted on oral prednisone 10 mg tablets.  She takes one-half tablet daily and this again has seemed to reduce the swelling and stiffness in her legs.  She continues on the prednisone in the same dosage for relief of the spasticity.,She has not been on any other immunomodulatory agents.,The patient does note some complaints of mild heat sensitivity and mild easy fatigability.  There is no history of diplopia, dysarthria, aphasia, focal weakness, numbness, paresthesias, cognitive dysfunction, or memory dysfunction.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Essentially noncontributory.,ALLERGIES:,  The patient is allergic to LOBSTER and VICODIN.  She feels that she is probably allergic to IODINE.,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  She does not smoke.  She takes one glass of wine per day.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: , She has not had any prior surgeries.  Her general health has been excellent except for the above-indicated problems.,REVIEW OF OUTSIDE RADIOLOGICAL STUDIES:,  The patient brought with her today MRI scans of the brain, thoracic spine, and lumbosacral spine performed on 11/14/02 on a 1.5-Tesla magnet.  There are numerous T2 hyperintense lesions in the periventricular and subcortical white matter of the brain and at least one lesion is in the corpus callosum.  There appear to be Dawson's fingers.  The MRI of the thoracic and lumbosacral spines did not reveal any significant abnormalities.,Also available are the MRI scans of the brain, cervical spine, thoracic spine, and lumbosacral spine performed on a 0.35-Tesla magnet on 04/22/05.  The MRI of the brain shows that one of the prior lesions has resolved and there appear to be one or two more lesions.,However, the quality of the newer scan is only 0.35-Tesla and is suboptimal.  Visualization of the cord is also suboptimal, but there are no clear-cut extraaxial or complexities of the spinal cord.  It is difficult to be certain that there are no intra-axial lesions, but I could not clearly see one.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,Vital signs:  Blood pressure 151/88, pulse 92, temperature 99.5¬∫F, and weight 124 lb (dressed).,General:  Well-developed, well-nourished female in no acute distress.,Head:  Normocephalic, without evidence of trauma or bruits.,Neck:  Supple, with full range of motion.

Rapid alternating movements normal.  No dysarthria.,Motor:  Tone, bulk, and strength are normal in both upper extremities.  In the lower extremities, there is moderate spasticity on the right and moderately severe spasticity on the left.  There are bilateral Achilles' contractures more so on the left than the right and also a slight left knee flexion contracture.,Strength in the lower extremities is rated as follows on a 5-point scale (right/left):  Iliopsoas 4+/5-, quadriceps 5-/5-, tibialis anterior 4+/4+, and gastrocnemius 5/5.  There are no tremors, fasciculations or abnormal involuntary movements.",
246,460,2956, Patient reports a six to eight-week history of balance problems with later fatigue and weakness., Neurology,1, Cervical Cord Lesion - Consult ,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:, This is a 58-year-old male who reports a six to eight-week history of balance problems with fatigue and weakness. He has had several falls recently. He apparently had pneumonia 10 days prior to the onset of the symptoms. He took a course of amoxicillin for this. He complained of increased symptoms with more and more difficulty with coordination. He fell at some point near the onset of the symptoms, but believes that his symptoms had occurred first. He fell from three to five feet and landed on his back. He began seeing a chiropractor approximately five days ago and had adjustments of the neck and lumbar spine, although he clearly had symptoms prior to this.,He has had mid and low back pain intermittently. He took a 10-day course of Cipro believing that he had a UTI. He denies, however, any bowel or bladder problems. There is no incontinence and he does not feel that he is having any difficulty voiding.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:, He has a history of surgery on the left kidney, when it was ""rebuilt."" He has had knee surgery, appendectomy and right inguinal hernia repair.,MEDICATIONS:, His only home medications had been Cipro and Aleve. However, he does take aspirin and several over the counter supplements including a multivitamin with iron, ""natural"" potassium, Starlix and the aspirin.,ALLERGIES:, HE HAS NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.,SOCIAL HISTORY:, He smokes one-and-one-half-packs of cigarettes per day and drinks alcohol at least several days per week. He is employed in sales, which requires quite a bit of walking, but he is not doing any lifting. He had been a golfer in the past.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:, He has had documented cervical spondylosis, apparently with an evaluation over 15 years ago.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure 156/101, pulse was 88, respirations 18. He is afebrile.,MENTAL STATUS: He is alert.,CRANIAL NERVES: His pupils were reactive to light. He had a dense left cataract present. The right disk margin appears sharp. His eye movements were full. The face was symmetric. Pain and temperature sensation were intact over both sides of the face. The tongue was midline.,NECK: His neck was supple.,MUSCULOSKELETAL: He has intact strength and normal tone in the upper extremities. He had increased tone in both lower extremities. He had hip flexion of 4/5 on the left. He had intact strength on the right lower extremity, although had slight hammertoe deformity bilaterally.,NEUROLOGIC: His reflexes were 2+ in the upper extremities, 3+ at the knees and 1+ at the ankles. He withdrew to plantar stimulation on the left, but did not have a Babinski response clearly present. He had intact finger-to-nose testing. Marked impairment in heel-to-shin testing. He was able to sit unassisted. He stood with assistance, but had a markedly ataxic gait. On sensory exam, he had a slight distal gradient to pin and vibratory sense in both lower extremities, but also had a decrease in sensation to pin over the right lower extremity compared to the left.,CARDIOVASCULAR: He had no carotid bruits. His heart rhythm was regular.,BACK: There was no focal back pain present. He did have a slight sensory level at the upper T spine at approximately T3, both anteriorly and posteriorly.,RADIOLOGIC DATA:, MRI by my view showed essentially unremarkable T spine. The MRI of his C spine showed significant spondylosis in the mid and lower C spine with spondylolisthesis at C7-T1. There is an abnormal signal in the cord which begins at approximately this level, but descends approximately 2 cm. There is slight enhancement at the mid-portion of the lesion. This appears to be an intrinsic lesion to the cord, not clearly associated with mild to moderate spinal stenosis at the level of the spondylolisthesis.,LABORATORY: ,His initial labs were unremarkable.,IMPRESSION: ,Cervical cord lesion at the C7 to T2 level of unclear etiology. Consider a transverse myelitis, tumor, contusion or ischemic lesion.,PLAN:, Will check labs including sedimentation rate, MRI of the brain, chest x-ray. He will probably need a lumbar puncture. He also appears to have a mild peripheral neuropathy, which I suspect is an independent problem. We will request labs for this.",

", Neurology,3, Cervical Spondylosis - Neuro Consult ,"REASON FOR NEUROLOGICAL CONSULTATION: , Cervical spondylosis and kyphotic deformity.  The patient was seen in conjunction with medical resident Dr. X. I personally obtained the history, performed examination, and generated the impression and plan.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: ,The patient is a 45-year-old African-American female whose symptoms first started some one and a half years ago with pain in the left shoulder and some neck pain.  This has subsequently resolved.  She started vigorous workouts in November 2005.  In March of this year, she suddenly could not feel her right foot on the bathroom floor and subsequently went to her primary care physician.  By her report, she had a nerve conduction study and a diagnosis of radiculopathy was made.  She had an MRI of lumbosacral spine, which was within normal limits.  She then developed a tingling sensation in the right middle toe.  Symptoms progressed to sensory symptoms of her knees, elbows, and left middle toe.  She then started getting sensory sensations in the left hand and arm.  She states that she feels a little bit wobbly at the knees and that she is slightly dragging her left leg.  Symptoms have been mildly progressive.  She is unaware of any trigger other than the vigorous workouts as mentioned above.  She has no associated bowel or bladder symptoms.  No particular position relieves her symptoms.,Workup has included two MRIs of the C-spine, which were personally reviewed and are discussed below.  She saw you for consultation and the possibility of surgical decompression was raised.  At this time, she is somewhat reluctant to go through any surgical procedure.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,1.  Ocular migraines.,2.  Myomectomy.,3.  Infertility.,4.  Hyperglycemia.,5.  Asthma.,6.  Hypercholesterolemia.,MEDICATIONS: , Lipitor, Pulmicort, Allegra, Xopenex, Patanol, Duac topical gel, Loprox cream, and Rhinocort.,ALLERGIES: , Penicillin and aspirin.,Family history, social history, and review of systems are discussed above as well as documented in the new patient information sheet.  Of note, she does not drink or smoke.  She is married with two adopted children.  She is a paralegal specialist.  She used to exercise vigorously, but of late has been advised to stop exercising and is currently only walking.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , She does complain of mild blurred vision, but these have occurred before and seem associated with headaches.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , On examination, blood pressure 138/82, pulse 90, respiratory rate 14, and weight 176.5 pounds.  Pain scale is 0.  A full general and neurological examination was personally performed and is documented on the chart.  Of note, she has a normal general examination.  Neurological examination reveals normal cognition and cranial nerve examination including normal jaw jerk.  She has mild postural tremor in both arms.  She has mild decreased sensation in the right palm and mild decreased light touch in the right palm and decreased vibration sense in both distal lower extremities.  Motor examination reveals no weakness to individual muscle testing, but on gait she does have a very subtle left hemiparesis.  She has hyperreflexia in her lower extremities, worse on the left.  Babinski's are downgoing.,PERTINENT DATA:  ,MRI of the brain from 05/02/06 and MRI of the C-spine from 05/02/06 and 07/25/06 were personally reviewed.  MRI of the brain is broadly within normal limits.  MRI of the C-spine reveals large central disc herniation at C6-C7 with evidence of mild cord compression and abnormal signal in the cord suggesting cord edema.  There is also a fairly large disc at C3-C4 with cord deformity and partial effacement of the subarachnoid space.  I do not appreciate any cord edema at this level.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  ,The patient is a 45-year-old female with cervical spondylosis with a large C6-C7 herniated disc with mild cord compression and signal change at that level.  She has a small disc at C3-C4 with less severe and only subtle cord compression.  History and examination are consistent with signs of a myelopathy.,Results were discussed with the patient and her mother.  I am concerned about progressive symptoms.  Although she only has subtle symptoms now, we made her aware that with progression of this process, she may have paralysis.  If she is involved in any type of trauma to the neck such as motor vehicle accident, she could have an acute paralysis.  I strongly recommended to her and her mother that she followup with you as soon as possible for surgical evaluation.  I agree with the previous physicians who have told her not to exercise as I am sure that her vigorous workouts and weight training since November 2005 have contributed to this problem.  I have recommended that she wear a hard collar while driving.  The results of my consultation were discussed with you telephonically.","neurology, kyphotic, cervical, radiculopathy, myelopathy, kyphotic deformity, cord compression, cervical spondylosis, toe, spondylosis, cord, "

He is a pleasant young man who has a diagnosis of bulbar cerebral palsy and hypotonia.  He has been treated by Dr. X through the pediatric neurology clinic.  He saw Dr. X recently and she noted that he was having difficulty with mouth breathing, which was contributing to some of his speech problems.  She also noted and confirmed that he has significant tonsillar hypertrophy.  The concern we have is whether he may benefit from surgery to remove his tonsils and improve his mouth breathing and his swallowing and speech.  Therefore, I ask for your opinion on this matter.,For his chronic allergic rhinitis symptoms, he is currently on Flonase two sprays to each nostril once a day.  He also has been taking Zyrtec 10 mg a day with only partial relief of the symptoms.  He does have an allergy to penicillin.,I appreciate your input on his care.  If you have any questions regarding, please feel free to call me through my office.  Otherwise, I look forward to hearing back from you regarding his evaluation.","neurology, peech, swallowing, breathing, bulbar cerebral palsy, mouth breathing, cerebral palsy, hypotoniaNOTE,: Thesetranscribed medical transcription sample reports and examples are provided by various users andare for reference purpose only.

He also has a longstanding history of neck pain.  His neurological examination is normal.  He has an MRI that shows some degenerative changes.  I do believe that his symptoms are probably referable to his neck.  However, I do not think that they are severe enough for him to undergo surgery at this point in time.  Perhaps another course of physical therapy may be helpful for him.  I probably would not recommend anymore invasive procedure, such as a spinal stimulator, as this pain really is minimal.  We could still try to treat him with neuropathic pain medications.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,1.  I scheduled him to return for an EMG and nerve conduction studies to determine whether there is any evidence of nerve damage, although I think the likelihood is low.,2.  I gave him a prescription for Neurontin.  I discussed the side effects of the medication with him.,3.  We can discuss his case tomorrow at Spine Conference to see if there are any further recommendations.",
254,471,2972, Patient seen in Neuro-Oncology Clinic because of increasing questions about what to do next for his anaplastic astrocytoma., Neurology,3, Anaplastic Astrocytoma - Letter ,"XYZ,RE:  ABC,MEDICAL RECORD#:  123,Dear Dr. XYZ:,I saw ABC back in Neuro-Oncology Clinic today.  He comes in for an urgent visit because of increasing questions about what to do next for his anaplastic astrocytoma.,Within the last several days, he has seen you in clinic and once again discussed whether or not to undergo radiation for his left temporal lesion.  The patient has clearly been extremely ambivalent about this therapy for reasons that are not immediately apparent.  It is clear that his MRI is progressing and that it seems unlikely at this time that anything other than radiation would be particularly effective.  Despite repeatedly emphasizing this; however, the patient still is worried about potential long-term side effects from treatment that frankly seem unwarranted at this particular time.,After seeing you in clinic, he and his friend again wanted to discuss possible changes in the chemotherapy regimen.  They came in with a list of eight possible agents that they would like to be administered within the next two weeks.  They then wanted another MRI to be performed and they were hoping that with the use of this type of approach, they might be able to induce another remission from which he can once again be spared radiation.,From my view, I noticed a man whose language has deteriorated in the week since I last saw him.  This is very worrisome.  Today, for the first time, I felt that there was a definite right facial droop as well.  Therefore, there is no doubt that he is becoming symptomatic from his growing tumor.  It suggests that he is approaching the end of his compliance curve and that the things may rapidly deteriorate in the near future.,Emphasizing this once again, in addition, to recommending steroids I once again tried to convince him to undergo radiation.  Despite an hour, this again amazingly was not possible.  It is not that he does not want treatment, however.  Because I told him that I did not feel it was ethical to just put him on the radical regimen that him and his friend devised, we compromised and elected to go back to Temodar in a low dose daily type regimen.  We would plan on giving 75 mg/sq m everyday for 21 days out of 28 days.  In addition, we will stop thalidomide 100 mg/day.  If he tolerates this for one week, we then agree that we would institute another one of the medications that he listed for us.  At this stage, we are thinking of using Accutane at that point.,While I am very uncomfortable with this type of approach, I think as long as he is going to be monitored closely that we may be able to get away with this for at least a reasonable interval.  In the spirit of compromise, he again consented to be evaluated by radiation and this time, seemed more resigned to the fact that it was going to happen sooner than later.  I will look at this as a positive sign because I think radiation is the one therapy from which he can get a reasonable response in the long term.,I will keep you apprised of followups.  If you have any questions or if I could be of any further assistance, feel free to contact me.,Sincerely,","neurology, neuro oncology, anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic, oncology, radiation, astrocytoma"

He had been well until 7 months prior to evaluation when he started having spells which were described as ""dizzy spells"" lasting from several seconds to one minute in duration. They occurred quite infrequently and he was able to resume activity immediately following the episodes. The spell became more frequent and prolonged, and by the time of initial evaluation were occurring 2-3 times per day and lasting 2-3 minutes in duration. In addition, in the 3 months prior to evaluation, the right upper extremity would become tonic and flexed during the episodes, and he began to experience post ictal fatigue.,BIRTH HX:, 32 weeks gestation to a G4 mother and weighed 4#11oz.

Unremarkable general and neurologic exam.,Impression: Psychomotor seizures.,Studies: Skull X-Rays were unremarkable.,EEG showed ""minimal spike activity during hyperventilation, as well as random sharp delta activity over the left temporal area, in drowsiness and sleep. This record also showed moderate amplitude asymmetry ( left greater than right) over the frontal central and temporal areas, which is a peculiar finding."",COURSE:, The patient was initially treated with Phenobarbital; then Dilantin was added (early 1970's); then Depakene was added ( early 1980's) due to poor seizure control. An EEG on 8/22/66 showed ""Left mid-temporal spike focus with surrounding slow abnormality, especially posterior to the anterior temporal areas (sparing the parasagittal region). In addition, the right lateral anterior hemisphere voltage is relatively depressed. ...this suggests two separate areas of cerebral pathology."" He underwent his first HCT scan in Sioux City in 1981, and this revealed an right temporal arachnoid cyst. The patient had behavioral problems throughout elementary/junior high/high school. He underwent several neurosurgical evaluations at UIHC and Mayo Clinic and was told that surgery was unwarranted. He was placed on numerous antiepileptic medication combinations including Tegretol, Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Depakote, Acetazolamide, and Mysoline. Despite this he averaged 2-3 spells a month. He was last seen, 6/19/95, and was taking Dilantin and Tegretol. His typical spells were described as sudden in onset and without aura. He frequently becomes tonic or undergoes tonic-clonic movement and falls with associated loss of consciousness. He usually has rapid recovery and can return to work in 20 minutes. He works at a Turkey packing plant. Serial HCT scans showed growth in the arachnoid cyst until 1991, when growth arrest appeared to have occurred.","neurology, arachnoid cyst, hct scan, seizures, serial hct scans, dizzy spells, drowsiness, hyperventilation, loss of consciousness, moderate amplitude asymmetry, temporal area, tonic-clonic movement, phenobarbital, dilantin, cyst, temporal, arachnoid"

Possible adult hydrocephalus (331.5).,2.  Mild gait impairment (781.2).,3.  Mild cognitive slowing (290.0).,PLAN: , I had a long discussion with the patient her husband.,I think it is possible that the patient is developing symptomatic adult hydrocephalus.  At this point, her symptoms are fairly mild.  I explained to them the two methods of testing with CSF drainage.  It is possible that a large volume lumbar puncture would reveal whether she is likely to respond to shunt and I described that test.  About 30% of my patients with walking impairment in a setting of possible adult hydrocephalus can be diagnosed with a large volume lumbar puncture.  Alternatively, I could bring her into the hospital for four days of CSF drainage to determine whether she is likely to respond to shunt surgery.  This procedure carries a 2% to 3% risk of meningitis.  I also explained that it would be reasonable to start with an outpatient lumbar puncture and if that is not sufficient we could proceed with admission for the spinal catheter protocol.",

She came in with severe traumatic brain injury and severe multiple fractures of the right side of the skull. , Neurosurgery,1, Hemicraniectomy ,"TITLE OF OPERATION:,  Left-sided large hemicraniectomy for traumatic brain injury and increased intracranial pressure.,INDICATION FOR SURGERY: ,  The patient is a patient well known to my service.  She came in with severe traumatic brain injury and severe multiple fractures of the right side of the skull.  I took her to the operating a few days ago for a large right-sided hemicraniectomy to save her life.  I spoke with the family, the mom, especially about the risks, benefits, and alternatives of this procedure, most especially given the fact that she had undergone a very severe traumatic brain injury with a very poor GCS of 3 in some brainstem reflexes.  I discussed with them that this was a life-saving procedure and the family agreed to proceed with surgery as a level 1.  We went to the operating room at that time and we did a very large right-sided hemicraniectomy.  The patient was put in the intensive care unit.  We had placed also at that time a left-sided intracranial pressure monitor both which we took out a few days ago.  Over the last few days, the patient began to slowly deteriorate little bit on her clinical examination, that is, she was at first localizing briskly with the right side and that began to be less brisk.  We obtained a CT scan at this point, and we noted that she had a fair amount of swelling in the left hemisphere with about 1.5 cm of midline shift.  At this point, once again I discussed with the family the possibility of trying to save her life and go ahead and doing a left-sided very large hemicraniectomy with this __________  this was once again a life-saving procedure and we proceeded with the consent of mom to go ahead and do a level 1 hemicraniectomy of the left side.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room.  She was already intubated and under general anesthesia.  The head was put in a 3-pin Mayfield headholder with one pin in the forehead and two pins in the back to be able to put the patient with the right-hand side down and the left-hand side up since on the right-hand side, she did not have a bone flap which complicated matters a little bit, so we had to use a 3-pin Mayfield headholder.  The patient tolerated this well.  We sterilely prepped everything and we actually had already done a midline incision prior to this for the prior surgery, so we incorporated this incision into the new incision, and to be able to open the skin on the left side, we did a T-shaped incision with T vertical portion coming from anterior to the ear from the zygoma up towards the vertex of the skull towards the midline of the skin.  We connected this.  Prior to this, we brought in all surgical instrumentation under sterile and standard conditions.  We opened the skin as in opening a book and then we also did a myocutaneous flap.  We brought in the muscle with it.  We had a very good exposure of the skull.  We identified all the important landmarks including the zygoma inferiorly, the superior sagittal suture as well as posteriorly and anteriorly.  We had very good landmarks, so we went ahead and did one bur hole and the middle puncta right above the zygoma and then brought in the craniotome and did a very large bone flap that measured about 7 x 9 cm roughly, a very large decompression of the left side.  At this point, we opened the dura and the dura as soon as it was opened, there was a small subdural hematoma under a fair amount of pressure and cleaned this very nicely irrigated completely the brain and had a few contusions over the operculum as well as posteriorly.  All this was irrigated thoroughly.  Once we made sure we had absolutely great hemostasis without any complications, we went ahead and irrigated once again and we had controlled the meddle meningeal as well as the superior temporal artery very nicely.  We had absolutely good hemostasis.  We put a piece of Gelfoam over the brain.  We had opened the dura in a cruciate fashion, and the brain clearly bulging out despite of the fact that it was in the dependent position.  I went ahead and  irrigated everything thoroughly putting a piece of DuraGen as well as a piece of Gelfoam with very good hemostasis and proceeded to close the skin with running nylon in place.  This running nylon we put in place in order not to put any absorbables, although I put a few 0 popoffs just to approximate the skin nicely.  Once we had done this, irrigated thoroughly once again the skin.  We cleaned up everything and then we took the patient off __________ anesthesia and took the patient back to the intensive care unit.  The EBL was about 200 cubic centimeters.  Her hematocrit went down to about 21 and I ordered the patient to receive one unit of blood intraoperatively which they began to work on as we began to continue to do the work and the sponges and the needle counts were correct.  No complications.  The patient went back to the intensive care unit.","neurosurgery, large hemicraniectomy, intracranial pressure, multiple fractures, skull, traumatic brain injury, mayfield headholder, injury, hemicraniectomyNOTE"
265,482,2707, Patient returns for his first followup after shunt surgery., Neurosurgery,1, First Followup - Shunt Surgery ,"REASON FOR VISIT:,  Mr. A is an 86-year-old man who returns for his first followup after shunt surgery.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,I have followed Mr. A since May 2008.  He presented with eight to ten years of progressive gait impairment, cognitive impairment, and decreased bladder control.  We established a diagnosis of adult hydrocephalus with the spinal catheter protocol in June of 2008 and ,Mr. A underwent shunt surgery performed by Dr. X on August 1st.  A Medtronic Strata programmable shunt in the ventriculoperitoneal configuration programmed at level 2.0 was placed.,Mr. A comes today with his daughter, Pam and together they give his history.,Mr. A has had no hospitalizations or other illnesses since I last saw him.  With respect to his walking, his daughter tells me that he is now able to walk to the dining room just fine, but could not before his surgery.  His balance has improved though he still has some walking impairment.  With respect to his bladder, initially there was some improvement, but he has leveled off and he wears a diaper.,With respect to his cognition, both Pam and the patient say that his thinking has improved.  The other daughter, Patty summarized it best according to two of them.  She said, ""I feel like I can have a normal conversation with him again.""  Mr. A has had no headaches and no pain at the shunt site or at the abdomen.,MEDICATIONS: , Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d., metoprolol 25 mg p.o. q.d., Flomax 0.4 mg p.o. q.d., Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.d., Detrol LA 4 mg p.o. q.d., lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d., Imodium daily, Omega-3, fish oil, and Lasix.,MAJOR FINDINGS:,  Mr. A is a pleasant and cooperative man who is able to converse easily though his daughter adds some details.,Vital Signs:  Blood pressure 124/80, heart rate is 64, respiratory rate is 18, weight 174 pounds, and pain is 0/10.,The shunt site was clean, dry, and intact and confirmed at a setting of 2.0.,Mental Status:  Tested for recent and remote memory, attention span, concentration, and fund of knowledge.  He scored 26/30 on the MMSE when tested with spelling and 25/30 when tested with calculations.  Of note, he was able to get two of the three memory words with cuing and the third one with multiple choice.  This was a slight improvement over his initial score of 23/30 with calculations and 24/30 with spelling and at that time he was unable to remember any memory words with cuing and only one with multiple choice.,Gait:  Tested using the Tinetti assessment tool.  He was tested without an assistive device and received a gait score of 6-8/12 and a balance of score of 12/16 for a total score of 18-20/28.  This has slightly improved from his initial score of 15-17/28.,Cranial Nerves:  Pupils are equal.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Face symmetric.  No dysarthria.,Motor:  Normal for bulk and strength.,Coordination:  Slow for finger-to-nose.,IMAGING: , CT scan was reviewed from 10/15/2008.  It shows a frontal horn span at the level of foramen of Munro of 4.6 cm with a 3rd ventricular contour that is flat with the span of 10 mm.  By my reading, there is a tiny amount of blood in the right frontal region with just a tiny subdural collection.  This was not noticed by the radiologist who stated no extraaxial fluid collections.  There is also substantial small vessel ischemic change.,ASSESSMENT: , Mr. A has made some improvement since shunt surgery.,PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES:,1.  Adult hydrocephalus (331.5).,2.  Gait impairment (781.2).,3.  Urinary incontinence and urgency (788.33).,4.  Cognitive impairment (290.0).,PLAN:,  I had a long discussion with Mr. A and his daughter.  We are all pleased that he has started to make some improvement with his hydrocephalus because I believe I see a tiny fluid collection in the right parietal region, I would like to leave the setting at 2.0 for another three months before we consider changing the shunt.  I do not believe that this tiny amount of fluid is symptotic and it was not documented by the radiologist when he read the CT scan.,Mr. A asked me about whether he will be able to drive again.  Unfortunately, I think it is unlikely that his speed of movement will improve to a level that he will be able to pass a driver's safety evaluation, however, occasionally patients surprise me by improving enough over 9 to 12 months that they are able to pass such a test.  I would certainly be happy to recommend such a test if I believe ,Mr. A is likely to pass it and he is always welcome to enroll in a driver's safety program without my recommendation, however, I think it is exceeding unlikely that he has the capability of passing this rigorous test at this time.  I also think it is quite likely he will not regain sufficient speed of motion to pass such a test.",

Surgery was recommended.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS: , Cystic suprasellar tumor.,POSTOP DIAGNOSIS:,  Cystic suprasellar tumor.,PROCEDURE DETAIL: , The patient was brought to operating room, underwent smooth induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, head was placed in the horseshoe head rest and positioned supine with head turned slightly towards left and slightly extended.  The patient was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  With the assistance of fluoro and mapping the localization, the right nostril was infiltrated.  Dr. X will dictate the procedure of the approach.  Once the dura was visualized, there was a complex procedure secondary to the small nasal naris as well as the bony drilling that would necessitate significant drilling.  Once the operating microscope was in the field, at this point, the drilling was completed.  The dura was opened in cruciate fashion revealing normal pituitary, which was displaced and the cystic tumor.  This was then opened and using microsurgical technique with the curette suctioned and the pituitary calcifications were removed, several Valsalva maneuvers were performed without any evidence of CSF leak and trying to pull the tumor further down.  Once this was completed, there was no evidence of any bleeding.  The endoscope was then used to remove any residual fragments __________ with the arachnoid.  Once this was completely ensured, small piece of Duragel was placed and the closure will be dictated by Dr. X.  She was reversed, extubated, and transported to the ICU in stable condition.  Blood loss, minimal.

Status post orbitozygomatic resection of a pituitary tumor with a very large intracranial component basically a very large skull-based brain tumor., Neurosurgery,1, Craniotomy ,"TITLE OF OPERATION: , Right-sided craniotomy for evacuation of a right frontal intracranial hemorrhage.,INDICATION FOR SURGERY: , The patient is very well known to our service.  In brief, the patient is status post orbitozygomatic resection of a pituitary tumor with a very large intracranial component basically a very large skull-based brain tumor.  He was taken to the operating room for the orbitozygomatic approach.  Intraoperatively, everything went well without any complications.  The brain at the end of the procedure was absolutely intact, but the patient developed a seizure in the Intensive Care Unit and then was taken to the CT scan, developed a second seizure.  He was given Ativan for this, and then began to identify a large component measuring about 3 x 3 cm of the right frontal lobe, what appeared to be a hemorrhagic conversion of potential venous infarct.  I had a long discussion immediately with Dr. X and Dr. Y.  We decided to take the patient immediately as a level 1 for evacuation of this hematoma with a small amount of a midline shift with an intraventricular component.  It worried me and I think that we needed to go ahead and take him to the operating room immediately.  The patient was taken as a level 1 immediately and emergently and into the operating room for this procedure.  The original plan was to do first a right-sided orbitozygomatic procedure and then stage it a few weeks later with an endonasal endoscopic procedure for resection of this pituitary tumor component.  He was taken to the operating room for evacuation of a right frontal intraparenchymal hematoma.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS:,  Pituitary tumor with a large intracranial component, status post resection and now development of an intracranial hemorrhage.,POSTOP DIAGNOSIS:,  Intracranial hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe with extension into the intraventricular space after resection of a pituitary tumor via orbitozygomatic approach.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room.  In the supine position, his head was put in a horseshoe without any complications.  The patient tolerated this very well, and the prior incision was immediately opened.  The surgery had taken place a few hours prior to this, the original orbitozygomatic approach.  At this point, this was a life-saving procedure.  We went ahead, opened the old incision after everything was sterilely prepped, and all the surgical instrumentation was brought into place.  We went ahead and opened the incision and took out the pterional bone flap without any complications.  We immediately opened the dura expeditiously, and the brain was moderately under some pressure, but not really bulging out.  So I went ahead and identified an area over the right frontal lobe that was a little bit consistent with a hemorrhagic infarct and nonviable tissue.  So we went ahead and did a corticectomy right there and identified the actual clot immediately and went ahead, and over the next few hours, very meticulously began to evacuate these clots without any complication whatsoever.  We went all the way down to the ventricle and identified this clot in the ventricle and went ahead and removed this clot without any complications, and we had a very nice resection.  The brain was very relaxed.  We had a very good resection of the actual blood clot, and the brain was very relaxed.  We irrigated thoroughly.  We identified the ventricles.  We went ahead and did a very careful hemostasis with Avitene with thrombin and Gelfoam with thrombin over the next times in doing the procedure.  All this was done very well, and then we lined the cavity with Surgicel, and the Surgicel was only put at the edge and draping down as to not to leave any fragments potentially to communicate with the actual ventricle, and then after this, everything was good.  We went ahead and closed back the actual dura back.  We had done a pericranial flap.  This was also put back in place and the dura was closed with 4-0 Surgilons.  We reconstructed everything.  The frontal sinus was reconstructed thoroughly without any complications.  We went ahead and put once again a watertight closure and went ahead and put another piece of DuraGen with Hemaseel in place, and went ahead and put the bone flap back and reconstructed very nicely once again with self-tapping, self-drilling screws, low-profile plates.  Once everything was confirmed to be in place, we went ahead and closed the muscle flap and also the actual fat pad was put back into place and closed together with 0 pop-offs, and the skin with staples without any complications.  In summary, the procedure was going back to the operating room for evacuation of a right-sided intracranial hemorrhage, most likely a conversion of an intraparenchymal hematoma with extension into the ventricle without any complications.  So everything was stable.  Estimated blood loss was about 100 cubic centimeters.  The sponges and needle counts were correct.  No specimens were sent to pathology.,DISPOSITION: , The patient after this procedure was brought to the Neuro Intensive Care Unit for close observation.","neurosurgery, orbitozygomatic, intracranial, brain tumor, intraparenchymal hematoma, orbitozygomatic approach, frontal lobe, intracranial hemorrhage, pituitary tumor, craniotomy, hemorrhage,"

We decided go ahead with anterior cervical discectomy at C5-C6 and fusion.  The risks of lack of pain relief, paralysis, hoarse voice, nerve injuries, and infection were explained and the patient agreed to proceed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room where a general endotracheal anesthesia was induced without complication.  The patient was placed in the slightly extended position with the neck and the head was restrained in a doughnut and the occiput was restrained by the doughnut.  He had tape placed over the shoulders during intraoperative x-rays and his elbows were well padded.  The tape was placed and his arms were well padded.  He was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  A linear incision was fashioned at the cricothyroid level from near the midline to over the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  We separated the platysma from the subcutaneous tissue and then opened the platysma along the medial border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  We then dissected sharply medial to carotid artery, which we palpated to the prevertebral region.  We placed Caspar retractors for medial and lateral exposure over the C5-C6 disc space, which we confirmed with the lateral cervical spine x-ray including 18-gauge needle in the disc space.  We then marked the disc space.  We then drilled off ventral osteophyte as well as osteophyte creating concavity within the disc space.  We then under magnification removed all the disc material, we could possibly see down to bleeding bone and both the endplates.  We took down posterior longitudinal ligament as well.  We incised the 6-mm cornerstone bone.  We placed a 6-mm parallel medium bone nicely into the disc space.  We then sized a 23-mm plate.  We inserted the screws nicely above and below.  We tightened down the lock-nuts.  We irrigated the wound.  We assured hemostasis using bone wax prior to placing the plate.  We then assured hemostasis once again.  We reapproximated the platysma using 3-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted fashion.  The subcutaneous level was closed using 3-0 Vicryl in a simple buried fashion.  The skin was closed with 3-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular stitch.  Steri-Strips were applied.  Dry sterile dressing with Telfa was applied over this.  We obtained an intraoperative x-ray to confirm the proper level and good position of both plates and screw construct on the lateral x-ray and the patient was transferred to the recovery room, moving all four extremities with stable vital signs.  I was present as a primary surgeon throughout the entire case.","neurosurgery, allograft fusion, anterior cervical discectomy, neck pain, cervical spine, discectomy, fusion, sternocleidomastoid muscle, assured hemostasis, anterior cervical, cervical discectomy, disc space, cervical, anterior, allograft"

Also some wax at the external meatus I cleaned with a Q-tip with peroxide.  The patient has no medical allergies.  Since he recently had a course of Omnicef we chose to put him on Augmentin (I checked and we did not have samples), so I phoned in a two-week course of Augmentin 400 mg chewable twice daily with food at Walgreens.  I looked at this throat which looks clear.  The nose only has a little clear mucinous secretions.  If there is any ear drainage, please use the Floxin drops.  I asked Mom to have the family doctor (or Dad, or me) check the ears again in about two weeks from now to be sure there is no residual infection.

Since last consultation she has tolerated Lamictal well, but she has had a recurrence of her myoclonic jerking.  She has not had a generalized seizure.  She is very concerned that this will occur.  Most of the myoclonus is in the mornings.  Recent EEG did show polyspike and slow wave complexes bilaterally, more prominent on the left.

Romberg negative.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN:,  Recurrence of early morning myoclonus despite high levels of Lamictal.  She is tolerating the medication well and has not had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure.  She is concerned that this is a precursor for another generalized seizure.  She states that she is compliant with her medications and has had a normal sleep-wake cycle.,Looking back through her notes, she initially responded very well to Keppra, but did have a breakthrough seizure on Keppra.  This was thought secondary to severe insomnia when her baby was very young.  Because she tolerated the medication well and it was at least partially affective, I have recommended adding Keppra 500 mg b.i.d.  Side effect profile of this medication was discussed with the patient.,I will see in followup in three months.","office notes, generalized tonic-clonic seizure, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, tonic clonic seizure, myoclonic epilepsy, tonic clonic, juvenile, myoclonus, epilepsy, myoclonic, seizure"

343,565,2373," Vitrectomy. A limited conjunctival peritomy was created with Westcott scissors to expose the supranasal and, separately, the supratemporal and inferotemporal quadrants.  ", Ophthalmology,3, Vitrectomy - 3 ,"DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:,  The patient was brought to the operating room and appropriately identified.  Local anesthesia was obtained with a 50/50 mixture of 2% lidocaine and 0.75% bupivacaine given as a peribulbar block.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A lid speculum was used to provide exposure to the right eye.,A limited conjunctival peritomy was created with Westcott scissors to expose the supranasal and, separately, the supratemporal and inferotemporal quadrants.  Calipers were set at 3.5 mm and a mark was made 3.5 mm posterior to the limbus in the inferotemporal quadrant.,A 5-0 nylon suture was passed through partial-thickness sclera on either side of this mark.  The MVR blade was used to make a sclerotomy between the pre-placed sutures.  An 8-0 nylon suture was then pre-placed for later sclerotomy closure.  The infusion cannula was inspected and found to be in good working order.  The infusion cannula was placed in the vitreous cavity and secured with the pre-placed sutures.  The tip of the infusion cannula was directly visualized and found to be free of any overlying tissue and the infusion was turned on.,Additional sclerotomies were made 3.5 mm posterior to the limbus in the supranasal and supratemporal quadrants.  The light pipe and vitrectomy handpieces were then placed in the vitreous cavity and a vitrectomy was performed.  There was moderately severe vitreous hemorrhage, which was removed.  Once a view of the posterior pole could be obtained, there were some diabetic membranes emanating along the arcades.  These were dissected with curved scissors and judicious use of the vitrectomy cutter.  There was some bleeding from the inferotemporal frond.  This was managed by raising the intraocular pressure and using intraocular cautery.  The surgical view became cloudy and the corneal epithelium was removed with a beaver blade.  This improved the view.  There is an area suspicious for retinal break near where the severe traction was inferotemporally.  The Endo laser was used to treat in a panretinal scatter fashion to areas that had not received previous treatment.  The indirect ophthalmoscope was used to examine the retinal peripheral for 360 degrees and no tears, holes or dialyses were seen.  There was some residual hemorrhagic vitreous skirt seen.  The soft-tip cannula was then used to perform an air-fluid exchange.  Additional laser was placed around the suspicious area inferotemporally.  The sclerotomies were then closed with 8-0 nylon suture in an X-fashion, the infusion cannula was removed and it sclerotomy closed with the pre-existing 8-0 nylon suture.,The conjunctiva was closed with 6-0 plain gut.  A subconjunctival injection of Ancef and Decadron were given and a drop of atropine was instilled over the eye.  The lid speculum was removed.  Maxitrol ointment was instilled over the eye and the eye was patched.  The patient was brought to the recovery room in stable condition.","ophthalmology, conjunctival peritomy, westcott scissors, lid speculum, inferotemporal quadrants, inferotemporal, conjunctival, scissors, supranasal, supratemporal, sclerotomy, eye, vitreous, vitrectomy, infusion, cannulaNOTE"

Since she has only one seeing eye, I am anxious to obtain a decreased inflammation as soon as possible.  She has been on oral steroids in the past.  We also discussed, considering the aggressive recurrent nature of this process, it is likely we will have to consider a steroid sparing agent to maintain longer term control of this recurrent process so that we do not use visual acuity in the left.  I anticipate we will likely start methotrexate in the near future.  In this acute phase, I have recommended oral steroids at a dose of 60 mg a day, hourly topical Pred Forte as well as atropine sulfate.  We will watch her closely in clinic.  I am sending a copy of this dictation to her primary care doctor, she said she has had a negative HLA-B27, rheumatoid factor, and ANA in the past.  At this stage, to be thorough I would ask Dr. X to assist us in repeating her chest x-ray, PPD if not current, and an RPR.  Additionally, in anticipation of need for methotrexate, it would be helpful to have a full liver function profile as well as hepatitis B and hepatitis C.","ophthalmology, iritis, nongranulomatous, uveitis, eye inflammation, photophobia, recurrent nongranulomatous anterior iritis, headache and photophobia, anterior chamber, anterior, chamber, inflammation, "

Once anesthesia was achieved, the right eye was prepped with Betadine, rinsed with saline, and draped in a sterile fashion.  A lid speculum was placed and 4-0 silk sutures passed under the superior and inferior rectus muscles stabilizing the globe.  A fornix-based conjunctival flap was prepared superiorly from 10 to 12 o'clock and episcleral vessels were cauterized using a wet-field.  A surgical groove was applied with a 69 Beaver blade 1 mm posterior to the limbus in a frown configuration in the 10 to 12 o'clock position.  A lamellar dissection was carried anteriorly to clear cornea using a crescent knife.  A stab incision was applied with a Superblade at the 2 o'clock position at the limbus.  The chamber was also entered through the lamellar groove using a 3-mm keratome in a beveled fashion.  Viscoat was injected into the chamber and an anterior capsulorrhexis performed.  Hydrodissection was used to delineate the nucleus and the phacoemulsification tip was inserted into the chamber.  A deep linear groove was dissected through the nucleus vertically and the nucleus was rotated 90 degrees with the assistance of a spatula through the side-port incision.  A second groove was dissected perpendicular to the first and the nucleus was fractured into quadrants.  Each quadrant was emulsified under burst power within the capsular bag.  The epinuclear bowl was manipulated with vacuum, flipped into the iris plane, and emulsified under pulse power.  I&A was used to aspirate cortex from the capsular bag.  A scratcher was used to polish the capsule, and Viscoat was injected inflating the capsular bag and chamber.  The wound was enlarged with a shortcut blade to 5.5 mm.  The intraocular lens was examined, found to be adequate, irrigated with balanced salt, and inserted into the capsular bag.  The lens centralized nicely and Viscoat was removed using the I&A.  Balanced salt was injected through the side-port incision.  The wound was tested, found to be secure, and a single 10-0 nylon suture was applied to the wound with the knot buried within the sclera.  The conjunctiva was pulled over the suture, and Ancef 50 mg and Decadron 4 mg were injected sub-Tenon in the inferonasal and inferotemporal quadrants.  Maxitrol ointment was applied topically followed by an eye pad and shield.

All of their questions were answered.  Informed consent was signed.  The patient was brought into the operating room.  A surgical time-out was performed during which all members of the operating room staff agreed upon the patient's name, operation to be performed, and correct operative eye.  After administration of general anesthesia, the patient was intubated without incident.,The right eye was prepared and draped in the usual fashion for ophthalmic surgery.  A wire lid speculum was used to separate the eyelids of the left eye.  A 9 o'clock anterior chamber paracentesis was created with Supersharp blade and the anterior chamber was filled with Healon.  The clear corneal incision was superior to the visual axis and was closed with three interrupted 10-0 nylon sutures with the knots buried.  A standard three-port pars plana vitrectomy __________ was initiated by performing partial conjunctival peritomies in the superonasal, superotemporal, and inferotemporal quadrants with Westcott scissors.  Hemostasis was achieved with bipolar cautery.  A 7-0 Vicryl suture was preplaced in the mattress fashion, 3 mm posterior to the surgical limbus in the inferotemporal quadrant.  A microvitreoretinal blade was used to create a sclerotomy at this site and a 4-mm infusion cannula was introduced through the sclerotomy and tied in place with the aforementioned suture.  The presence of the tip of the cannula was confirmed to be within the vitreous cavity prior to initiation of posterior infusion.  Two additional sclerotomies were created superonasally and superotemporally, 3 mm posterior to the surgical limbus with microvitreoretinal blade.,The vitreous cutter was used to perform the pars plana lens actively preserving peripheral anterior capsule.  The pars plana vitrectomy was performed with the assistance of the BIOM non-contact lens indirect viewing system using the light pipe illuminator and the vitreous cutter.  The vitreous was trimmed to the vitreous base.  A posterior vitreous detachment was created and extended 360 degrees with the assistance of triamcinolone for staining.,The foreign body appeared to exit the posterior pole along the superotemporal arcade and apparently severed a branched retinal artery resulting in an area of macular ischemia with retinal whitening along its course.  The exit wound was explored.  No intraocular foreign body or mural foreign body was observed with the assistance of intraocular forceps.  The intraocular magnet was then inserted through the sclerotomy and no foreign body was again identified.,An air-fluid exchange was performed with the assistance of the soft-tip extrusion cannula and the retinal periphery was examined with scleral depression.  No retinal breaks or defects were noted in the periphery.  The plugs were placed in the sclerotomies and the conjunctival peritomy was extended at 360 degrees.  Each of the rectus muscles was isolated on a 2-0 silk suture and a #XXX band was threaded beneath each of the rectus muscle and fixed to itself in the inferonasal quadrant with the Watzke sleeve.  The buckle was sutured to the eye wall with 5-0 Mersilene sutures in each quadrant in a mattress fashion.  The buckle was trimmed and the height of the buckle was inspected internally and noted to be adequate.,Residual intraocular fluid was removed with a soft-tip extrusion cannula and the sclerotomies were closed with 7-0 Vicryl sutures.  A 12% concentration of C3F8 gas was flushed through the eye.  The infusion cannula was removed and the sclerotomy was closed with the preplaced 7-0 Vicryl suture.  All of the sclerotomies were noted to be airtight.  The intraocular pressure following injection of 0.05 mL each of vancomycin (0.5 mg) and ceftazidime (1 mg) were injected through the superotemporal pars plana, 30-gauge needles.,The conjunctiva was closed with 6-0 plain gut sutures with the knots buried.  Subconjunctival injections of Ancef and Decadron were delivered inferotemporally.  The lid speculum was removed.  Pred-G ointment and atropine solution were applied to the ocular surface.  The eye was patched and shielded, and the patient was returned to the recovery room in stable condition, having tolerated the procedure well.  There were no complications.,I was the attending surgeon, was present and scrubbed for the entirety of the procedure.",

Macula, vessels, and periphery were within normal limits.  On the left eye, the patient has a cup-to-disc ratio of 0.3 and macula vessels and periphery are also within normal limits.  On gonioscopy, the patient shows deep anterior chamber angle OU and is open to the ciliary body band 360 degrees.,In conclusion, my initial impression is that Mr. ABC does not have glaucoma.  He has fairly symmetric and small cup-to-disc ratios OU.  His intraocular pressures were within normal limits in our office today.  I discussed at length with him the alternatives of observation versus continued work-up and testing.  He seemed to understand very well and went with my recommendation to continue observation for now.  We will take fundus photos of his optic nerves for future comparison, but I think given the lack of any strong findings suspicious for glaucoma, we will defer further testing at this time.,Should you have any specific questions or any other information that you think that I may not have included in this evaluation, please feel free to contact me.

I examined Mrs. ABC initially on MM/DD/YYYY.  At that time, she expressed a chief concern of occasional pain around her eye, but denied any flashing lights, floaters, halos, or true brow ache.  She reports a family history of glaucoma in her mother, but is unsure of the specific kind.  Her past ocular history has been fairly unremarkable.  As you know, she has a history of non-insulin dependent diabetes.  She is unaware of her last hemoglobin A1c levels, but reports a blood sugar of 158 taken on the morning of her appointment with me.  She is followed by Dr. X here locally.,Upon examination, her visual acuity measured 20/20-1 in either eye with her glasses.  Presenting intraocular pressures were14 mmHg in either eye at 2:03 p.m.  Pupillary reactions, confrontational visual fields, and ocular motility were normal.  The slit lamp exam revealed narrow anterior chambers and on gonioscopy only the buried anterior trabecular meshwork was visible in either eye, but the angle deepened with gonio-compression suggesting appositional and not synechial closure.  I deferred the dilated portion of the exam on that day.,We proceeded with peripheral iridectomies and following this upon her most recent visit on MM/DD/YYYY, I was able to safely dilate her eyes as her chambers had deepened and the PIs were patent.  I note that she has an increased CD ratio measuring 0.65 in the right eye and 0.7 in the left and although her FDT visual fields and GDX testing were normal at your office, she does have an enlarged blind spot in either eye on Humphrey visual fields and retinal tomography also shows some suspicious changes.  Therefore, I feel she has sustained some optic nerve damage perhaps from intermittent angle closure in the past.,In summary, Mrs. ABC has a history of narrow angles not successfully treated with laser PIs.  Her intraocular pressures have remained stable.  I will continue to monitor her closely.,Thank you very much once again for allowing me to have shared in her care.

The next day he woke up and he had double vision again. ", Ophthalmology,3, Diplopia ,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 53-year-old right-handed gentleman who presents to the clinic for further evaluation of diplopia.  He states that he was in his usual state of health when he awoke one morning in January 2009.  He had double vision.  He states when he closed each eye, the double vision dissipated.  The double vision entirely dissipated within one hour.  He was able to drive.  However, the next day he woke up and he had double vision again.  Over the next week, the double vision worsened in intensity and frequency and by the second week, it was severe.  He states that he called Sinai Hospital and spoke to a physician who recommended that he come in for evaluation.  He was seen by a primary care physician who sent him for an ophthalmologic evaluation.  He was seen and referred to the emergency department for an urgent MRI to evaluate for possible aneurysm.  The patient states that he had a normal MRI and was discharged to home.,For the next month, the double vision improved, although he currently still experiences constant diplopia.  Whereas in the past, when he would see two objects, they were very far apart in a horizontal plane; now they are much closer together.  He still does not drive.  He also is not working due to the double vision.  There is no temporal fluctuation to the double vision.  More recently, over the past month, he has developed right supraorbital pain.  It actually feels like there is pain under his right lid.  He denies any dysphagia, dysarthria, weakness, numbness, tingling, or any other neurological symptoms.,There is a neurology consultation in the computer system.  Dr. X saw the patient on February 2, 2009, when he was in the emergency department.  He underwent an MRI that showed a questionable 3 mm aneurysm of the medial left supraclinoid internal carotid artery, but there were no abnormalities on the right side.  MRV was negative and MRI of the brain with and without contrast was also negative.  He also had an MRI of the orbit with and without contrast that was normal.  His impression was that the patient should follow up for a possible evaluation of myasthenia gravis or other disorder.,At the time of the examination, it was documented that he had right lid ptosis.  He had left gaze diplopia.  The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.  His neurological examination was otherwise entirely normal.  According to Dr. X's note, the ophthalmologist who saw him thought that there was ptosis of the right eye as well as an abnormal pupil.

Simultaneous recordings were made in both eyes in the horizontal direction and the left eye in the vertical directions.  Caloric irrigations were performed using a closed loop irrigation system at 30 degrees and 44 degrees C into either ear.,FINDINGS: , Gaze testing did not reveal any evidence of nystagmus.  Saccadic movements did not reveal any evidence of dysmetria or overshoot.  Sinusoidal tracking was performed well for the patient's age.  Optokinetic nystagmus testing was performed poorly due to the patient's difficulty in following the commands.  Therefore adequate OKNs were not achieved.  The Dix-Hallpike maneuver in the head handing left position resulted in moderate intensity left beating nystagmus, which was converted to a right beating nystagmus when she sat up again.  The patient complained of severe dizziness in this position.  There was no clear-cut decremental response with repetition.  In the head hanging left position, no significant nystagmus was identified.  Positional testing in the supine, head hanging, head right, head left, right lateral decubitus, and left lateral decubitus positions did not reveal any evidence of nystagmus.,Caloric stimulation revealed a calculated unilateral weakness of 7.0% on the right (normal <20%) and left beating directional preponderance of 6.0% (normal <20-30%).,IMPRESSION: , Abnormal electronystagmogram demonstrating prominent nystagmus on position testing in the head hanging right position.  No other significant nystagmus was noted.  There was no evidence of clear-cut caloric stimulation abnormality.

A median parapatellar arthrotomy was performed.", Orthopedic,3, Total Knee Replacement - 1 ,"PROCEDURES: , Total knee replacement.,PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:,  The patient was bought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  After induction of anesthesia, a tourniquet was placed on the upper thigh.  Sterile prepping and draping proceeded.  The tourniquet was inflated to 300 mmHg.  A midline incision was made, centered over the patella.  Dissection was sharply carried down through the subcutaneous tissues.  A median parapatellar arthrotomy was performed.  The lateral patellar retinacular ligaments were released and the patella was retracted laterally.  Proximal medial tibia was denuded, with mild release of medial soft tissues.  The ACL and PCL were released.  The medial and lateral menisci and suprapatellar fat pad were removed.  These releases allowed for anterior subluxation of tibia.  An extramedullary tibial cutting jig was pinned to the proximal tibia in the appropriate alignment and flush cut was made along tibial plateau, perpendicular to the axis of the tibia.  Its alignment was checked with the rod and found to be adequate.  The tibia was then allowed to relocate under the femur.,An intramedullary hole was drilled into the femur and a femoral rod attached to the anterior cutting block was inserted, and the block was pinned in appropriate position, judging correct rotation using a variety of techniques.  An anterior rough cut was made.  The distal cutting jig was placed atop this cut surface and pinned to the distal femur, and the rod was removed.  The distal cut was performed.,A spacer block was placed, and adequate balance in extension was adjusted and confirmed, as was knee alignment.  Femoral sizing was performed with the sizer, and the appropriate size femoral 4-in-1 chamfer-cutting block was pinned in place and the cuts were made.  The notch-cutting block was pinned to the cut surface, slightly laterally, and the notch cut was then made.  The trial femoral component was impacted onto the distal femur and found to have an excellent fit.  A trial tibial plate and polyethylene were inserted, and stability was judged and found to be adequate in all planes.  Appropriate rotation of the tibial component was identified and marked.  The trials were removed and the tibia was brought forward again.  The tibial plate size was checked and the plate was pinned to plateau.  A keel guide was placed and the keel was then made.  The femoral intramedullary hole was plugged with bone from the tibia.  The trial tibial component and poly placed; and, after placement of the femoral component, range of motion and stability were checked and found to be adequate in various ranges of flexion and extension.,The patella was held in a slightly everted position with knee in extension.  Patellar width was checked with calipers.  A free-hand cut of the patellar articular surface was performed and checked to ensure symmetry with the calipers.  Sizing was then performed and 3 lug holes were drilled with the jig in place, taking care to medialize and superiorize the component as much as possible, given bony anatomy.  Any excess lateral patellar bone was recessed.  The trial patellar component was placed and found to have adequate tracking.  The trials were removed; and as the cement was mixed, all cut surfaces were thoroughly washed and dried.  The cement was applied to the components and the cut surfaces with digital pressurization, and then the components were impacted.  The excess cement was removed from the gutters and anterior and posterior parts of the knee.  The knee was brought into full extension with the trial polyethylene and further axially pressurized as cement hardened.  Once the cement had hardened, the tourniquet was deflated.  The knee was dislocated again, and any excess cement was removed with an osteotome.  Thorough irrigation and hemostasis were performed.  The real polyethylene component was placed and pinned.  Further vigorous power irrigation was performed, and adequate hemostasis was obtained and confirmed.  The arthrotomy was closed using 0 Ethibond and Vicryl sutures.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed after further irrigation with 2-0 Vicryl and Monocryl sutures.  The skin was sealed with staples.  Xeroform and a sterile dressing were applied followed by a cold-pack and Ace wrap.  The patient was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition, having tolerated the procedure well.","orthopedic, proximal medial tibia, total knee replacement, parapatellar arthrotomy, subcutaneous tissues, tibial plateau, incision, cutting, patella, femur, femoral, component, knee,"

The pain was described as a constant pain in the middle to lower back and hips. The pain was exacerbated by climbing stairs and in the morning after sleeping. He reported occasional radiation of pain from back into buttocks (greatest on the right side). He has history of chronic feet and leg numbness and paraesthesias related to his neuropathy, but he denied any recent changes in these symptoms in relation to the back pain. He denied any history of trauma. He was treated symptomatically with Acetaminophen with only some relief. He continued to complain intermittently of pain in his back and hips, and occasionally even in his elbows during the next 8 months. In January 2002, plain pelvic films showed no fracture or dislocation of the hips. Elbow films also showed no acute injury, but there were some erosions along the posterior aspect of the olecranon. An MRI was performed of his lumbar spine which showed degenerative disk disease, spondylosis, and annular bulging/herniation at L4-L5 with resultant encroachment on the neural foramen. He was evaluated by neurosurgery, who felt he should not have surgery at this time.

He is an unfortunate 19-year-old right-handed male who was injured in a motor vehicle accident on MM/DD/YYYY, where he was the driver of an automobile, which was struck on the front passenger's side.  The patient sustained impact injuries to his neck and lower back.  There was no apparent head injury or loss of consciousness and he denied any posttraumatic seizures.  He was taken to Hospital, x-rays were taken, apparently which were negative and he was released.,At the present time, he complains of neck and lower back pain radiating into his right arm and right leg with weakness, numbness, paraesthesia, and tingling in his right arm and right leg.  He has had no difficulty with bowel or bladder function.  He does experience intermittent headaches associated with his neck pain with no other associated symptoms.,PAST HEALTH:,  He was injured in a prior motor vehicle accident on MM/DD/YYYY.  At the time of his most recent injuries, he was completely symptom free and under no active therapy.  There is no history of hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, neurological disorders, ulcers or tuberculosis.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , He denies tobacco or alcohol consumption.,ALLERGIES: , No known drug allergies.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  ,None.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Otherwise noncontributory.,FUNCTIONAL INQUIRY: , Otherwise noncontributory.,REVIEW OF DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:,  Includes an MRI scan of the cervical spine dated MM/DD/YYYY which showed evidence for disc bulging at the C6-C7 level.  MRI scan of the lumbar spine on MM/DD/YYYY, showed evidence of a disc herniation at the L1-L2 level as well as a disc protrusion at the L2-L3 level with disc herniations at the L3-L4 and L4-L5 level and disc protrusion at the L5-S1 level.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , Reveals an alert and oriented male with normal language function.  Vital Signs:  Blood pressure was 105/68 in the left arm sitting.  Heart rate was 70 and regular.  Height was 5 feet 8 inches.  Weight was 182 pounds.  Cranial nerve evaluation was unremarkable.  Pupils were equal and reactive.  Funduscopic evaluation was clear.  There was no evidence for nystagmus.  There was decreased range of motion noted in both the cervical and lumbar regions to a significant degree, with tenderness and spasm in the paraspinal musculature.  Straight leg raising was limited to 45 degrees on the right and 90 degrees on the left.  Motor strength was 5/5 on the MRC scale.  Reflexes were 2+ symmetrical and active.  No pathological responses were noted.  Sensory examination showed a diffuse decreased sensation to pinprick in the right upper extremity.  Cerebellar function was normal.  There was normal station and gait.  Chest and cardiovascular evaluations were unremarkable.  Heart sounds were normal.  There were no extra sounds or murmurs.  Palpable trigger points were noted in the right trapezius and right cervical and lumbar paraspinal musculature.,CLINICAL IMPRESSION: , Reveals a 19-year-old male suffering from a posttraumatic cervical and lumbar radiculopathy, secondary to traumatic injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident on MM/DD/YYYY.  In view of the persistent radicular complaints associated with the weakness, numbness, paraesthesia, and tingling as well as the objective sensory loss noted on today's evaluation as well as the non-specific nature of the radiculopathy, I have scheduled him for an EMG study on his right upper and right lower extremity in two week's time to rule out any nerve root irritation versus any peripheral nerve entrapment or plexopathy as the cause of his symptoms.  Palpable trigger points were noted on today's evaluation.  He is suffering from ongoing myofascitis.  His treatment plan will consist of a series of trigger point injections to be initiated at his next follow up visit in two weeks' time.  I have encouraged him to continue with his ongoing treatment program under your care and supervision.  I will be following him in two weeks' time.

Patient has a history of chronic back pain, dating back to an accident that he states he suffered two years ago.  He states he helped a friend unload a motorcycle from a vehicle two-and-a-half days ago, after which he ""felt it"" in his lower back.  The following day (two days ago), he states he rode to Massachusetts and Maine to pick up clients.  He feels that this aggravated his chronic back pain as well.  He also claims to have a screw in his right hip from a previous surgery to repair a pelvic fracture.  He is being prescribed Ultram, Celebrex, gabapentin, and amitriptyline by his PCP for his chronic back pain.  He states that his PCP has informed him that he does not prescribe opiate medications for chronic back pain.,The patient did self-refer to another physician, who suggested that he follow up at a pain clinic for his chronic back pain to discuss other alternatives, particularly the medications that the patient feels that he needs.  Patient states he did not do this because he was feeling well at that time.,The patient did present to our emergency room last night, at which time he saw Dr. X.  He was given a prescription for 12 Vicodin as well as some to take home last night.  The patient has not picked up his prescription as of yet and informed the triage nurse that he was concerned that he would not have enough to last through the weekend.

There is some mild discomfort on internal and external rotation of the hips as well.  DTRs are 1+ at the knees and trace at the ankles.,I explained to the patient that he is suffering from a chronic condition and as his PCP has made it clear that he is unwilling to prescribe opiate medication, which the patient feels that he needs, and he is obligated to follow up at the pain clinic as suggested by the other physician even if he is having a ""good day.""  I explained to him that if he did not investigate other alternatives to what his PCP is willing to prescribe, then on a ""bad day,"" he will have nowhere else to turn.  I explained to him that some emergency physicians do chose to use opiates for a short term as Dr. X did last night.  It is unclear if the patient is looking for a different opiate medication, but I do not think it is wise to give him more, particularly as he has not even filled the prescription that was given to him last night.  I did suggest that he not restart his methadone and Darvocet at this time as he is already on five different medications for his back (Celebrex, tramadol, amitriptyline, gabapentin, and the Vicodin that he was given last night).  I did suggest that we could try a different anti-inflammatory if he felt that the Celebrex is not helping.  The patient is agreeable to this.,ASSESSMENT,1.  Lumbar muscle strain.,2.

Using blunt dissection radial sensory nerve was dissected and retracted out of the operative field.  Further blunt dissection exposed the radial artery, which was dissected and retracted off the trapezium.  An incision was then made across the scaphotrapezial joint distally onto the trapezium and out onto the carpometacarpal joint.  Sharp dissection exposed the trapezium, which was then morselized and removed in toto with care taken to protect the underlying flexor carpi radialis tendon.  The radial beak of the trapezoid was then osteotomized off the head of the scaphoid.  The proximal metacarpal was then fenestrated with a 4.5-mm drill bit.  Four fingers proximal to the flexion crease of the wrist a small incision was made over the FCR tendon and blunt dissection delivered the FCR tendon into this incision.  The FCR tendon was divided and this incision was closed with 4-0 nylon sutures.  Attention was returned to the trapezial wound where longitudinal traction on the FCR tendon delivered the FCR tendon into the wound.,The FCR tendon was then threaded through the fenestration in the metacarpal.  A bone anchor was then placed distal to the metacarpal fenestration.  The FCR tendon was then pulled distally and the metacarpal reduced to an anatomic position.  The FCR tendon was then sutured to the metacarpal using the previously placed bone anchor.  Remaining FCR tendon was then anchovied and placed into the scaphotrapezoidal and trapezial defect.  The MP joint was brought into extension and the capsule closed using interrupted 3-0 Tycron sutures.,Attention was turned to the MCP joint where the MP joint was brought in to 15 degrees of flexion and pinned with a single 0.035 Kirschner wire.  The pin was cut at the level of the skin.,All incisions were closed with running 3-0 Prolene subcuticular stitch.,Sterile dressings were then applied.  The tourniquet was deflated.

425,650,2214, Left hip fracture.  The patient is a 53-year-old female with probable pathological fracture of the left proximal femur., Orthopedic,3, Hip Fracture - ER Consult ,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION: , Left hip fracture.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a pleasant 53-year-old female with a known history of sciatica, apparently presented to the emergency room due to severe pain in the left lower extremity and unable to bear weight.  History was obtained from the patient.  As per the history, she reported that she has been having back pain with left leg pain since past 4 weeks.  She has been using a walker for ambulation due to disabling pain in her left thigh and lower back.  She was seen by her primary care physician and was scheduled to go for MRI yesterday.  However, she was walking and her right foot got caught on some type of rug leading to place excessive weight on her left lower extremity to prevent her fall.  Since then, she was unable to ambulate.  The patient called paramedics and was brought to the emergency room.  She denied any history of fall.  She reported that she stepped the wrong way causing the pain to become worse.  She is complaining of severe pain in her lower extremity and back pain.  Denies any tingling or numbness.  Denies any neurological symptoms.  Denies any bowel or bladder incontinence.,X-rays were obtained which were remarkable for left hip fracture.  Orthopedic consultation was called for further evaluation and management.  On further interview with the patient, it is noted that she has a history of malignant melanoma, which was diagnosed approximately 4 to 5 years ago.  She underwent surgery at that time and subsequently, she was noted to have a spread to the lymphatic system and lymph nodes for which she underwent surgery in 3/2008.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Sciatica and melanoma.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  ,As discussed above, surgery for melanoma and hysterectomy.,ALLERGIES: , NONE.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , Denies any tobacco or alcohol use.  She is divorced with 2 children.  She lives with her son.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  The patient is well developed, well nourished in mild distress secondary to left lower extremity and back pain.,MUSCULOSKELETAL:  Examination of the left lower extremity, there is presence of apparent shortening and external rotation deformity.  Tenderness to palpation is present.  Leg rolling is positive for severe pain in the left proximal hip.  Further examination of the spine is incomplete secondary to severe leg pain.  She is unable to perform a straight leg raising.  EHL/EDL 5/5.  2+ pulses are present distally.  Calf is soft and nontender.  Homans sign is negative.  Sensation to light touch is intact.,IMAGING:,  AP view of the hip is reviewed.  Only 1 limited view is obtained.  This is a poor quality x-ray with a lot of soft tissue shadow.  This x-ray is significant for basicervical-type femoral neck fracture.  Lesser trochanter is intact.  This is a high intertrochanteric fracture/basicervical.  There is presence of lytic lesion around the femoral neck, which is not well delineated on this particular x-ray.  We need to order repeat x-rays including AP pelvis, femur, and knee.,LABS:,  Have been reviewed.,ASSESSMENT: , The patient is a 53-year-old female with probable pathological fracture of the left proximal femur.,DISCUSSION AND PLAN: , Nature and course of the diagnosis has been discussed with the patient.  Based on her presentation without any history of obvious fall or trauma and past history of malignant melanoma, this appears to be a pathological fracture of the left proximal hip.  At the present time, I would recommend obtaining a bone scan and repeat x-rays, which will include AP pelvis, femur, hip including knee.  She denies any pain elsewhere.  She does have a past history of back pain and sciatica, but at the present time, this appears to be a metastatic bone lesion with pathological fracture.  I have discussed the case with Dr. X and recommended oncology consultation.,With the above fracture and presentation, she needs a left hip hemiarthroplasty versus calcar hemiarthroplasty, cemented type.  Indication, risk, and benefits of left hip hemiarthroplasty has been discussed with the patient, which includes, but not limited to bleeding, infection, nerve injury, blood vessel injury, dislocation early and late, persistent pain, leg length discrepancy, myositis ossificans, intraoperative fracture, prosthetic fracture, need for conversion to total hip replacement surgery, revision surgery, DVT, pulmonary embolism, risk of anesthesia, need for blood transfusion, and cardiac arrest.  She understands above and is willing to undergo further procedure.  The goal and the functional outcome have been explained.  Further plan will be discussed with her once we obtain the bone scan and the radiographic studies.  We will also await for the oncology feedback and clearance.,Thank you very much for allowing me to participate in the care of this patient.  I will continue to follow up.","orthopedic, calcar, proximal femur, pathological fracture, hip, fracture, hemiarthroplasty, melanoma, "

They were traveling. He came down on another player's foot sustaining what he describes as an inversion injury. Swelling and pain onset immediately. He was taped but was able to continue playing He was examined by John Houston, the trainer, and had tenderness around the navicular so was asked to come over and see me for evaluation. He has been in a walking boot. He has been taped firmly. Pain with weightbearing activities. He is limping a bit. No significant foot injuries in the past. Most of his pain is located around the dorsal aspect of the hindfoot and midfoot. ,PHYSICAL EXAM:, He does have some swelling from the hindfoot out toward the midfoot. His arch is maintained. His motion at the ankle and subtalar joints is preserved. Forefoot motion is intact. He has pain with adduction and abduction across the hindfoot. Most of this discomfort is laterally. His motor strength is grossly intact. His sensation is intact, and his pulses are palpable and strong. His ankle is not tender. He has minimal to no tenderness over the ATFL. He has no medial tenderness along the deltoid or the medial malleolus. His anterior drawer is solid. His external rotation stress is not painful at the ankle. His tarsometatarsal joints, specifically 1, 2 and 3, are nontender. His maximal tenderness is located laterally along the calcaneocuboid joint and along the anterior process of the calcaneus. Some tenderness over the dorsolateral side of the talonavicular joint as well. The medial talonavicular joint is not tender.,RADIOGRAPHS:, Those done of his foot weightbearing show some changes over the dorsal aspect of the navicular that appear chronic. I don't see a definite fracture. The tarsometarsal joints are anatomically aligned. Radiographs of his ankle again show changes along the dorsal talonavicular joint but no other fractures identified. Review of an MR scan of the ankle dated 12/01/05 shows what looks like some changes along the lateral side of the calcaneocuboid joint with disruption of the lateral ligament and capsular area. Also some changes along the dorsal talonavicular joint. I don't see any significant marrow edema or definitive fracture line. ,IMPRESSION:,  Left Chopart joint sprain.,PLAN:,  I have spoken to XYZ about this. Continue with ice and boot for weightbearing activities. We will start him on a functional rehab program and progress him back to activities when his symptoms allow.

She is not that sore at this point, and she has had a couple of cortisone shots.  Without being the initial treating physician, she has FCR tendinitis that fails to respond to cortisone shots.  She is a candidate for an FCR tunnel release.  It has been described and is effective for those patients with that problem.  My only consideration would be, if the patient should choose, to get an MRI when she is symptomatic to confirm the FCR tendinitis.  She will followup with Dr. ABC as needed or come back to us when she is thinking more along the lines of surgery.","orthopedic, fcr tendinitis, fcr tunnel release, cortisone shot, tendinitis, tunnel release, signs, oriented, shoulder, fcr"

This has subsequently resolved.  She started vigorous workouts in November 2005.  In March of this year, she suddenly could not feel her right foot on the bathroom floor and subsequently went to her primary care physician.  By her report, she had a nerve conduction study and a diagnosis of radiculopathy was made.  She had an MRI of lumbosacral spine, which was within normal limits.  She then developed a tingling sensation in the right middle toe.  Symptoms progressed to sensory symptoms of her knees, elbows, and left middle toe.  She then started getting sensory sensations in the left hand and arm.  She states that she feels a little bit wobbly at the knees and that she is slightly dragging her left leg.  Symptoms have been mildly progressive.  She is unaware of any trigger other than the vigorous workouts as mentioned above.  She has no associated bowel or bladder symptoms.  No particular position relieves her symptoms.,Workup has included two MRIs of the C-spine, which were personally reviewed and are discussed below.

Pain scale is 0.  A full general and neurological examination was personally performed and is documented on the chart.  Of note, she has a normal general examination.  Neurological examination reveals normal cognition and cranial nerve examination including normal jaw jerk.  She has mild postural tremor in both arms.  She has mild decreased sensation in the right palm and mild decreased light touch in the right palm and decreased vibration sense in both distal lower extremities.  Motor examination reveals no weakness to individual muscle testing, but on gait she does have a very subtle left hemiparesis.  She has hyperreflexia in her lower extremities, worse on the left.  Babinski's are downgoing.,PERTINENT DATA:  ,MRI of the brain from 05/02/06 and MRI of the C-spine from 05/02/06 and 07/25/06 were personally reviewed.  MRI of the brain is broadly within normal limits.  MRI of the C-spine reveals large central disc herniation at C6-C7 with evidence of mild cord compression and abnormal signal in the cord suggesting cord edema.  There is also a fairly large disc at C3-C4 with cord deformity and partial effacement of the subarachnoid space.  I do not appreciate any cord edema at this level.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  ,The patient is a 45-year-old female with cervical spondylosis with a large C6-C7 herniated disc with mild cord compression and signal change at that level.  She has a small disc at C3-C4 with less severe and only subtle cord compression.  History and examination are consistent with signs of a myelopathy.,Results were discussed with the patient and her mother.  I am concerned about progressive symptoms.  Although she only has subtle symptoms now, we made her aware that with progression of this process, she may have paralysis.  If she is involved in any type of trauma to the neck such as motor vehicle accident, she could have an acute paralysis.  I strongly recommended to her and her mother that she followup with you as soon as possible for surgical evaluation.  I agree with the previous physicians who have told her not to exercise as I am sure that her vigorous workouts and weight training since November 2005 have contributed to this problem.  I have recommended that she wear a hard collar while driving.

We decided go ahead with anterior cervical discectomy at C5-C6 and fusion.  The risks of lack of pain relief, paralysis, hoarse voice, nerve injuries, and infection were explained and the patient agreed to proceed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room where a general endotracheal anesthesia was induced without complication.  The patient was placed in the slightly extended position with the neck and the head was restrained in a doughnut and the occiput was restrained by the doughnut.  He had tape placed over the shoulders during intraoperative x-rays and his elbows were well padded.  The tape was placed and his arms were well padded.  He was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  A linear incision was fashioned at the cricothyroid level from near the midline to over the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  We separated the platysma from the subcutaneous tissue and then opened the platysma along the medial border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  We then dissected sharply medial to carotid artery, which we palpated to the prevertebral region.  We placed Caspar retractors for medial and lateral exposure over the C5-C6 disc space, which we confirmed with the lateral cervical spine x-ray including 18-gauge needle in the disc space.  We then marked the disc space.  We then drilled off ventral osteophyte as well as osteophyte creating concavity within the disc space.  We then under magnification removed all the disc material, we could possibly see down to bleeding bone and both the endplates.  We took down posterior longitudinal ligament as well.  We incised the 6-mm cornerstone bone.  We placed a 6-mm parallel medium bone nicely into the disc space.  We then sized a 23-mm plate.  We inserted the screws nicely above and below.  We tightened down the lock-nuts.  We irrigated the wound.  We assured hemostasis using bone wax prior to placing the plate.  We then assured hemostasis once again.  We reapproximated the platysma using 3-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted fashion.  The subcutaneous level was closed using 3-0 Vicryl in a simple buried fashion.  The skin was closed with 3-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular stitch.  Steri-Strips were applied.  Dry sterile dressing with Telfa was applied over this.  We obtained an intraoperative x-ray to confirm the proper level and good position of both plates and screw construct on the lateral x-ray and the patient was transferred to the recovery room, moving all four extremities with stable vital signs.  I was present as a primary surgeon throughout the entire case.","orthopedic, allograft fusion, anterior cervical discectomy, neck pain, cervical spine, discectomy, fusion, sternocleidomastoid muscle, assured hemostasis, anterior cervical, cervical discectomy, disc space, cervical, anterior, allograft"

Placement of SynchroMed infusion pump.,2.  Tunneling of SynchroMed infusion pump catheter,3.  Anchoring of the intrathecal catheter and connecting of the right lower quadrant SynchroMed pump catheter to the intrathecal catheter.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , Under general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was placed in a lateral decubitus position.  The patient was prepped and draped in a sterile manner.  The intrathecal catheter was placed via a percutaneous approach by the pain management specialist at which point an incision was made adjacent to the needle containing the intrathecal catheter.  This incision was carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue to the paraspinous muscle fascia which was cleared around the entry point of the intrathecal catheter needle.  A pursestring suture of 3-0 Prolene was placed around the needle in the paraspinous muscle.  The needle was withdrawn.  The pursestring suture was tied to snug the tissues around the catheter and prevent cerebrospinal fluid leak.  The catheter demonstrated free flow of cerebrospinal fluid,throughout the RV procedure.  The catheter was anchored to the paraspinous muscle with an anchoring device using interrupted sutures of 3-0 Prolene.  Antibiotic irrigation and antibiotic soak sponge were placed into the wound, and the catheter was clamped to prevent persistent leakage of cerebrospinal fluid while the SynchroMed-pump pocket was created.  Then, I turned my attention to the anterior abdominal wall where an oblique incision was made and carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue to the external oblique fascia, which was freed from attachments to the overlying subcutaneous tissue utilizing blunt and sharp dissection with electrocautery.  A pocket was created that would encompass the SynchroMed fusion pump.  A tunneling device was then passed through the subcutaneous tissue from the back incision to the abdominal incision, and a SynchroMed pump catheter was placed to the tunneling device.  The tunneling device was then removed leaving the SynchroMed pump catheter extending from the anterior abdominal wall incision to the posterior back incision.  The intrathecal catheter was trimmed.  A clear plastic boot was placed over the intrathecal catheter, and the connecting device was advanced from the SynchroMed pump catheter into the intrathecal catheter connecting the 2 catheters together.  The clear plastic boot was then placed over the connection, and it was anchored in place with 0-silk ties.  Good CSF was then demonstrated flowing through the SynchroMed pump catheter.  The SynchroMed pump catheter was connected to the SynchroMed pump and anchored in place with a 0-silk tie.  Excess catheter was coiled and placed behind the pump.  The pump was placed into the subcutaneous pocket created for it on the anterior abdominal wall.  The pump was anchored to the anterior abdominal wall fascia with interrupted sutures of 2-0 Prolene; 4 of the sutures were placed.  The subcutaneous tissues were irrigated with normal saline.  The subcutaneous tissue of both wounds was closed with running suture of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin of both wounds was closed with staples.  Antibiotic ointment and a sterile dressing were applied.  The patient was awake and taken to the recovery room.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was stable at the completion of the procedure.  All sponge and lap, needle and instrument counts were correct at the completion of the procedure.","pain management, intrathecal, catheter, paraspinous, cerebrospinal, synchromed infusion pump, synchromed pump catheter, synchromed pump, paraspinous muscle, cerebrospinal fluid, tunneling device, infusion pump, subcutaneous tissue, infusion, synchromed, pump, incision,"

She has noticed a marked improvement on the right side, which was subject to a botulinum toxin injection about two weeks ago.  She did not have any side effects on the Botox injection and she feels that her activities of daily living are increased, but she is still on the oxycodone and methadone.  The patient's husband confirms the fact that she is doing a lot better, that she is more active, but there are still issues yet regarding anxiety, depression, and frustration regarding the pain in her neck.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,  The patient is appropriate.  She is well dressed and oriented x3.  She still smells of some cigarette smoke.  Examination of the neck shows excellent reduction in muscle spasm on the right paraspinals, trapezius and splenius capitis muscles.  There are no trigger points felt and her range of motion of the neck is still somewhat guarded, but much improved.  On the left side, however, there is significant muscle spasm with tight bands involving the multifidus muscle with trigger point activity and a lot of tenderness and guarding.  This extends down into the trapezius muscle, but the splenius capitis seems to be not involved.,TREATMENT PLAN:,  After a long discussion with the patient and the husband, we have decided to go ahead and do botulinum toxin injection into the left multifidus/trapezius muscles.  A total of 400 units of Botox is anticipated.  The procedure is being scheduled.  The patient's medications are refilled.

485,713,1906," He continues to have abdominal pain, and he had a diuretic renal scan, which indicates no evidence of obstruction and good differential function bilaterally. ", Pediatrics - Neonatal,3, Pediatric Urology Letter ,"XYZ, M.D. ,Suite 123, ABC Avenue ,City, STATE 12345 ,RE:  XXXX, XXXX ,MR#:  0000000,Dear Dr. XYZ: ,XXXX was seen in followup in the Pediatric Urology Clinic.  I appreciate you speaking with me while he was in clinic.  He continues to have abdominal pain, and he had a diuretic renal scan, which indicates no evidence of obstruction and good differential function bilaterally. ,When I examined him, he seems to indicate that his pain is essentially in the lower abdomen in the suprapubic region; however, on actual physical examination, he seems to complain of pain through his entire right side.  His parents have brought up the question of whether this could be gastrointestinal in origin and that is certainly an appropriate consideration.  They also feel that since he has been on Detrol, his pain levels have been somewhat worse, and so, I have given them the option of stopping the Detrol initially.  I think he should stay on MiraLax for management of his bowels.  I would also suggest that he be referred to Pediatric Gastroenterology for evaluation.  If they do not find any abnormalities from a gastrointestinal perspective, then the next step would be to endoscope his bladder and then make sure that he does not have any evidence of bladder anatomic abnormalities that is leading to this pain. ,Thank you for following XXXX along with us in Pediatric Urology Clinic.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me. ,Sincerely yours,","pediatrics - neonatal, differential function, diuretic renal scan, abdominal pain, renal scan, pediatric urology, "
486,714,1907, Increasing oxygen requirement.  Baby boy has significant pulmonary hypertension.  , Pediatrics - Neonatal,1, Pulmonary Hypertension - Pediatric Consult ,"INDICATION FOR CONSULTATION: , Increasing oxygen requirement.,HISTORY: , Baby boy, XYZ, is a 29-3/7-week gestation infant.  His mother had premature rupture of membranes on 12/20/08.  She then presented to the Labor and Delivery with symptoms of flu.  The baby was then induced and delivered.  The mother had a history of premature babies in the past.  This baby was doing well, and then, we had a significant increasing oxygen requirement from room air up to 85%.  He is now on 60% FiO2.,PHYSICAL FINDINGS,GENERAL:  He appears to be pink, well perfused, and slightly jaundiced.,VITAL SIGNS:  Pulse 156, 56 respiratory rate, 92% sat, and 59/28 mmHg blood pressure.,SKIN:  He was pink.,He was on the high-frequency ventilator with good wiggle.,His echocardiogram showed normal structural anatomy.  He has evidence for significant pulmonary hypertension.  A large ductus arteriosus was seen with bidirectional shunt.  A foramen ovale shunt was also noted with bidirectional shunt.  The shunting for both the ductus and the foramen ovale was equal left to right and right to left.,IMPRESSION: , My impression is that baby boy, XYZ, has significant pulmonary hypertension.  The best therapy for this is to continue oxygen.  If clinically worsens, he may require nitric oxide.  Certainly, Indocin should not be used at this time.  He needs to have lower pulmonary artery pressures for that to be considered.,Thank you very much for allowing me to be involved in baby XYZ's care.","pediatrics - neonatal, high-frequency ventilator, structural anatomy, foramen ovale, oxygen requirement, hypertension, pulmonary "

Although this has been a very successful treatment in terms of her febrile seizure control, she is now having occasional brief periods of pauses and staring, where she becomes unresponsive, but does not lose her postural tone.  The typical spell according to dad last anywhere from 10 to 15 seconds, mom says 3 to 4 minutes, which likely means probably somewhere in the 30- to 40-second period of time.  Mom did note that an episode had happened outside of a store recently, was associated with some perioral cyanosis, but there has never been a convulsive activity noted.  There have been no recent changes in her Keppra dosing and she is currently only at 20 mg/kg per day, which is overall a low dose for her.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Born at 36 weeks' gestation by C-section delivery at 8 pounds 3 ounces.  She does have a history of febrile seizures and what parents reported an abdominal migraine, but on further questioning, it appears to be more of a food intolerance issue.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: , She has undergone no surgical procedures.,FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY: , There is a strong history of epilepsy on the maternal side of family including mom with some nonconvulsive seizure during childhood and additional seizures in maternal great grandmother and a maternal great aunt.  There is no other significant neurological history on the paternal side of the family.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , Currently lives with her mom, dad, and two siblings.  She is at home full time and does not attend day care.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  ,Clear review of 10 systems are taken and revealed no additional findings other than those mentioned in the history of present illness.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,Vital Signs:  Weight was 15.6 kg.  She was afebrile.  Remainder of her vital signs were stable and within normal ranges for her age as per the medical record.,General:  She was awake, alert, and oriented.  She was in no acute distress, only slightly flustered when trying to place the EEG leads.,HEENT:  Showed normocephalic and atraumatic head.  Her conjunctivae were nonicteric and sclerae were clear.  Her eye movements were conjugate in nature.  Her tongue and mucous membranes were moist.,Neck:  Trachea appeared to be in the midline.,Chest:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally without crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.,Cardiovascular:  Showed a normal sinus rhythm without murmur.,Abdomen:  Showed soft, nontender, and nondistended, with good bowel sounds.  There was no hepatomegaly or splenomegaly, or other masses noted on examination.,Extremities:  Showed IV placement in the right upper extremity with appropriate restraints from the IV.  There was no evidence of clubbing, cyanosis or edema throughout.  She had no functional deformities in any of her peripheral limbs.,Neurological:  From neurological standpoint, her cranial nerves were grossly intact throughout.  Her strength was good in the bilateral upper and lower extremities without any distal to proximal variation.  Her overall resting tone was normal.  Sensory examination was grossly intact to light touch throughout the upper and lower extremities.  Reflexes were 1+ in bilateral patella.  Toes were downgoing bilaterally.  Coordination showed accurate striking ability and good rapid alternating movements.  Gait examination was deferred at this time due to EEG lead placement.,ASSESSMENT:,  A 2-1/2-year-old female with history of febrile seizures, now with concern for spells of unclear etiology, but somewhat concerning for partial complex seizures and to a slightly lesser extent nonconvulsive generalized seizures.,RECOMMENDATIONS,1.  For now, we will go ahead and try to capture EEG as long as she tolerates it; however, if she would require sedation, I would defer the EEG until further adjustments to seizure medications are made and we will see her response to these medications.,2.  As per the above, I will increase her Keppra to 300 mg p.o. b.i.d. bringing her to a total daily dose of just under 40 mg/kg per day.  If further spells are noted, we may increase upwards again to around 4.5 to 5 mL each day.,3.  I do not feel like any specific imaging needs to be done at this time until we see her response to the medication and review her EEG findings.  EEG, hopefully, will be able to be reviewed first thing tomorrow morning; however, I would not delay discharge the patient to wait on the EEG results.  The patient has been discharged and we will contact the family as an outpatient.,4.  The patient will need followup arrangement with me in 5 to 6 weeks' time, so we may recheck and see how she is doing and arrange for further followup then.",

Laparoscopic fundoplication and gastrostomy was done because of the need for enteral feeding access and to protect her airway at a time when it is either going to heal enough to improve and allow decannulation or eventually prove that she will need laryngotracheoplasty.  Dr. X is following The patient for this and currently plans are to perform a repeat endoscopic exam every couple of months to assist the status of her airway caliber.,The patient had a laparoscopic fundoplication and gastrostomy on 10/05/2007.  She has done well since that time.  She has had some episodes of retching intermittently and these seemed to be unpredictable.  She also had some diarrhea and poor feeding tolerance about a week ago but that has also resolved.  The patient currently takes about 1 ounce to 1.5 ounce of her feedings by mouth and the rest is given by G-tube.  She seems otherwise happy and is not having an excessive amount of stools.  Her parents have not noted any significant problems with the gastrostomy site.,The patient's exam today is excellent.  Her belly is soft and nontender.  All of her laparoscopic trocar sites are healing with a normal amount of induration, but there is no evidence of hernia or infection.  We removed The patient's gastrostomy button today and showed her parents how to reinsert one without difficulty.  The site of the gastrostomy is excellent.  There is not even a hint of granulation tissue or erythema, and I am very happy with the overall appearance.,IMPRESSION: , The patient is doing exceptionally well status post laparoscope fundoplication and gastrostomy.  Hopefully, the exquisite control of acid reflux by fundoplication will help her airway heal, and if she does well, allow decannulation in the future.  If she does require laryngotracheoplasty, the protection from acid reflux will be important to healing of that procedure as well.,PLAN:  ,The patient will follow up as needed for problems related to gastrostomy.  We will see her when she comes in the hospital for endoscopic exams and possibly laryngotracheoplasty in the future.","pediatrics - neonatal, decannulation, enteral feeding, feeding access, laparoscopic fundoplication, gastrostomy, airway, laryngotracheoplasty, laparoscopic, fundoplication, "

It often first appears between the toes.  It can be a one-time occurrence or it can be chronic.  The fungus, known as Trichophyton, thrives under warm, damp conditions so people whose feet sweat a great deal are more susceptible.  It is easily transmitted in showers and pool walkways.  Those people with immunosuppressive conditions, such as diabetes mellitus, are also more susceptible to athlete's foot.,SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS:,*  Itchy feet.,*  White or red and soft scaling on feet, usually in between toes.,*  Small blisters may be present.,*  Bad foot odor.,*  Very rare involvement of hands and simultaneously (called an Id reaction).,TREATMENT:,*  Diagnosis is via symptoms or sometimes by examining skin scrapings under a microscope..  A bacterial infection may also be suspected in which case a skin culture will confirm this.,*  Try a non-prescription antifungal powder or cream available in drugstores; your doctor can prescribe a stronger topical antifungal medication if necessary.,*  Oral antibiotics may be prescribed for a possible bacterial infection.,*  Keep feet as dry as possible! Change socks twice a day if necessary and wear those made of natural fibers, such as cotton.  Go barefoot when you have a chance or wear sandals.  Dry thoroughly in between toes after swimming or bathing.,*  A special powder to absorb moisture on feet is also available in drugstores.  Ask the pharmacist about this.,*  Spray your shower at home with a 10% bleach solution after bathing.  This may help decrease the chance that other family members will be infected.,*  Wear sandals or thongs in public showers and around pools.,*  Keep in mind that it may take up to a month or more to get rid of your athlete's foot.  Be diligent in using the antifungal medication.  Unfortunately, recurrence of athlete's foot is common.  Luckily, the condition does not cause serious problems for the majority of people who have it.,*  Call the office if your athlete's foot spreads or worsens despite treatment.,PLANTAR FASCIAL STRETCHES,1.  Raise toes toward you while bending your ankle as high as you can.,2.  Hold this position for 15 seconds.,3.  Alternate doing this with the opposite foot 10 times.,4.

Review of systems is otherwise negative.,OBJECTIVE:,  Weight is 46.5 pounds, which is down just a little bit from his appointment last month.  He was 49 pounds, but otherwise, fairly well controlled, not all that active in the exam room.  Physical exam itself was deferred today because he has otherwise been very healthy.,ASSESSMENT:,  At this point is attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, doing fairly well with the Adderall.,PLAN:,  Discussed with mother two options.  Switch him to the Ritalin LA, which I think has better release of the medicine early in the morning or to increase his Adderall dose.  As far as the afternoon, if she really wanted him to be on the medication, we will do a small dose of the Adderall, which she would prefer.  So I have decided at this point to increase him to the Adderall XR 15 mg in the morning and then Adderall 5 mg in the afternoon.  Mother is to watch his diet.  We would like to recheck his weight if he is doing very well, in two months.  But if there are any problems, especially in the morning then we would do the Ritalin LA.  Mother understands and will call if there are problems.  Approximately 25 minutes spent with patient, all in discussion.","psychiatry / psychology, adhd, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, adderall xr, recheck, medicines, adderall,"

He has no recollection of the event.  The following information is obtained from his medical record.  On 09/29/09, he reportedly went to a five-hour meeting and stated several times ""I do not feel well"" and looked ""glazed.""  He does not remember anything from midmorning until the middle of the night and when his wife came home, she found him in bed at 6 p.m., which is reportedly unusual.  She thought he was warm and had chills.  He later returned to his baseline.  He was seen by Dr. X in the hospital on 09/30/09 and reported to him at that time that he felt that he had returned entirely to baseline.  His neurological exam at that time was unremarkable aside from missing one of three items on recall for the Mini-Mental Status Examination.  Due to mild memory complaints from himself and his wife, he was referred for more extensive neuropsychological testing.  Note that reportedly when his wife found him in bed, he was shaking and feeling nauseated, somewhat clammy and kept saying that he could not remember anything and he was repeating himself, asking the same questions in an agitated way, so she brought him to the emergency room.

He thought that his memory abilities were similar to those of his peers of his same age.  When I asked about this episode, he said he had no recall of it at all and that he ""felt fine the whole time.""

This is a 90-minute initial intake completed on 10/03/2007.  I met with the patient's mother individually for the entire session.  I reviewed with her the treatment, consent form, as well as the boundaries of confidentiality, and she stated that she understood these concepts.,PRESENTING PROBLEMS: , Mother reported that her primary concern in regard to the patient had to do with his oppositionality.  She was more ambivalent regarding addressing the encopresis.  In regards to his oppositionality, she reported that the onset of his oppositionality was approximately at 4 years of age, that before that he had been a very compliant and happy child, and that he has slowly worsened over time.  She noted that the oppositionality occurred approximately after his brother, who has multiple medical problems, was born.  At that time, mother had spent 2 months back East with the brother due to his feeding issues and will have to go again next year.  She reported that in terms of the behaviors that he loses his temper frequently, he argues with her that he defies her authority that she has to ask him many times to do things, that she has to repeat instructions, that he ignores her, that he whines, and this is when he is told to do something that he does not want to do.  She reported that he deliberately annoys other people, that he can be angry and resentful.  She reported that he does not display these behaviors with the father nor does he display them at home, but they are specific to her.  She reported that her response to him typically is that she repeats what she wants him to do many, many times, that eventually she gets upset.  She yells at him, talks with him, and tries to make him go and do what she wants him to do.  Mother also noted that she probably ignores some his misbehaviors.  She stated that the father tends to be more firm and more direct with him, and that, the father sometimes thinks that the mother is too easy on him.  In regards to symptoms of depression, she denied symptoms of depression, noting that he tends to only become unhappy when he has to do something that he does not want to do, such as go to school or follow through on a command.

He does sit on the toilet may be 2 times a day, although that is not consistent.  Mother believes that he is probably constipated or impacted again.  He refuses to eat any fiber.  In regards to what happens when he soils, mother basically takes full responsibility.  She cleans and changes his underwear, thinks of things that she has tried, she mostly gets frustrated, makes negative comments, even though she knows that he really cannot help it.  She has never provided him with any sort of rewards, because she feels that this is something he just needs to learn to do.  In regards to other issues, she noted that he becomes frustrated quite easily, especially around homework, that when mother has to correct him, or when he has had difficulty doing something that he becomes upset, that he will cry, and he will get angry.  Mother's response to him is that either she gets agitated and raises her voice, tells him to stop etc.  Mother reported it is not only with homework, but also with other tasks, such as if he is trying to build with his LEGOs and things do not go well.,DEVELOPMENTAL BACKGROUND: , The patient was reported to be the 8 pound 12 ounce product of a planned and noncomplicated pregnancy and emergency cesarean delivery.

He currently is taking MiraLax.,FAMILY BACKGROUND: , The patient lives with his mother who is age 37, and is primarily a homemaker, but does work approximately 48 hours a month as a beautician; with his father, age 35, who is a police officer; and also, with his younger brother who is age 3, and has significant medical problems as will be noted in a moment.  Mother and father have been together since 1997, married in 1999.  The maternal grandmother and grandfather are living and are together, and live in the Central California Coast Area.  There is one maternal aunt, age 33, and then, two adopted maternal aunt and uncle, age 18 and age 13.  In regards to the father's side of the family, the paternal grandparents are divorced.  Grandfather was in Arkansas, grandmother lives in Dos Palos.  The patient does not see his grandfather.  Mother stated that her relationship with her child was as described, that he very much stresses her out, that she wishes that he was not so defiant, that she finds him to be a very stressful child to deal with.  In regards to the relationship with the father, it was reported that the father tends to leave most of the parenting over to the mother, unless she specifically asks him to do something, and then, he will follow through and do it.  He will step in and back mother up in terms of parenting, tell the child not to speak to his mother that way etc.  Mother reported that he does spend some time with the children, but not as much as mother would like him to, but occasionally, he will go outside and do things with them.  The mother reported that sometimes she has a problem in interfering with his parenting, that she steps in and defends The patient.  It was reported that mother stated that she tries the parenting technique, primarily of yelling and tried time-out, although her description suggests that she is not doing time-out correctly, as he simply gets up from his time-out, and she does not follow through.  Mother reported that she and the patient are very much alike in temperament, and this has made things more difficult.  Mother tends to be stubborn and gets angry easily also.  Mother reported becoming fatigued in her parenting, that she lets him get away with things sometimes because she does not want to punish him all day long, sometimes ignores problems that she probably should not ignore.  There was reported to be jealousy between The patient and his brother, B.  B evidently has some heart problems and feeding issues, and because of that, tends to get more attention in terms of his medical needs, and that the patient is very jealous of that attention and feels that B is favored and that he get things that The patient does not get, and that there is some tension between the brothers.  They do play well together; however, The patient does tend to be somewhat intrusive, gets in his space, and then, B will hit him.  Mother reported that she graduated from high school, went to Community College, and was an average student.  No learning problems.  Mother has a history of depression.  She has currently been taking 100 mg of Zoloft administered by her primary medical doctor.  She is not receiving counseling.  She has been on the medications for the last 5 years.  Her dosage has not been changed in a year.  She feels that she is getting more irritable and more angry.  I  encouraged her to see a primary medical doctor.  Mother has no drug or alcohol history.  Father graduated from high school, went to the Police Academy, average student.  No learning problems, no psychological problems, no drug or alcohol problems are reported.  In terms of extended family, maternal grandmother as well as maternal great grandfather have a history of depression.  Other psychiatric symptoms were denied in the family.,Mother reported that the marriage is generally okay, that there is some arguing.  She reported that it was in the normal range.,ACADEMIC BACKGROUND: , The patient attends the Roosevelt Elementary School, where he is in a regular first grade classroom with Mrs. The patient.  This is in the Kingsburg Unified School District.  No behavior problems, academic problems were reported.  He does not receive special education services.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient was described as being able to make and keep friends, but at this point in time, there has been no teasing regarding smell from the encopresis.  He does have kids over to play at the house.,PREVIOUS COUNSELING:,  Denied.,DIAGNOSTIC SUMMARY AND IMPRESSION: , My impression is that the patient has a long history of constipation and impaction, which has been treated medically, but it would appear that the mother has not followed through consistently with the behavioral component of toilet sitting, increased fiber, regular medication, so that the problem has likely continued.  She also has not used any sort of rewards as a way to encourage him, in the encopresis.  The patient clearly qualifies for a diagnosis of disruptive behavior disorder, not otherwise specified, and possibly oppositional defiant disorder.  It would appear that mother needs help in her parenting, and that she tends to mostly use yelling and anger as a way, and tends to repeat herself a lot, and does not have a strategy for how to follow through and to deal with defiant behavior.  Also, mother and father, may not be on the same page in terms of parenting.,PLAN:,  In terms of my plan, I will meet with the child in the next couple of weeks.  I also asked the mother to bring the father in, so he could be involved in the treatment also, and I gave the mother a behavioral checklist to be completed by herself and the father as well as the teacher.,DSM IV DIAGNOSES:  ,AXIS I:  Adjustment disorder with disturbance of conduct (309.3).  Encopresis, without constipation, overflow incontinence (307.7),AXIS II:  No diagnoses (V71.09).,AXIS III:  No diagnoses.,AXIS IV:  Problems with primary support group.,AXIS V:  Global assessment of functioning equals 65.","psychiatry / psychology, developmental background, axis, dsm iv, adjustment disorder, behavioral, adjustment, depression, oppositionality, encopresis, "

This optimizes the chance of controlling tumor while diminishing the acute and long-term side effects.  With conformal 3-dimensional simulation, there is extended physician, therapist, and dosimetrist effort and time expended.  The patient is initially taken into a conventional simulator room where appropriate markers are placed and the patient is positioned and immobilized.  Preliminary filed sizes and arrangements, including gantry angles, collimator angles, and number of fields are conceived.  Radiographs are taken and these films are approved by the physician.  Appropriate marks are placed on the patient's skin or on the  immobilization device.,The patient is transferred to the diagnostic facility and placed on a flat CT scan table.  Scans are performed through the targeted area.  The scans are evaluated by the radiation oncologist and the tumor volume, target volume, and critical structures are outlined on the CT images.  The dosimetrist then evaluates the slices in the treatment-planning computer with appropriately marked structures.  This volume is reconstructed in a virtual 3-dimensional space utilizing the beam's-eye view features.  Appropriate blocks are designed.  Multiplane computerized dosimetry is performed throughout the volume.  Field arrangements and blocking are modified as necessary to provide coverage of the target volume while minimizing dose to normal structures.,Once appropriate beam parameters and isodose distributions have been confirmed on the computer scan, the individual slices are then reviewed by the physician.  The beam's-eye view, block design, and appropriate volumes are also printed and reviewed by the physician.  Once these are approved, physical blocks or multi-leaf collimator equivalents will be devised.  If significant changes are made in the field arrangements from the original simulation, the patient is brought back to the simulator where computer designed fields are re-simulated.,In view of the extensive effort and time expenditure required, this procedure justifies the special procedure code, 77470.","radiology, 3-dimensional simulation, planned radiation therapy, ct scan, ct images, beam's eye view, field arrangements, normal structures, therapy, dimensional, simulationNOTE,: Thesetranscribed medical transcription sample reports and examples are provided by various users andare for reference purpose only.

As she has no pain, I have decreased the prednisone to 2.5 mg a day starting tomorrow if she is to go back to her nursing home tomorrow.  If in a couple of weeks her symptoms stay the same, then I would discontinue the prednisone.  I would defer that to Dr. X.  If she flares up at that point, prednisone may have to be restarted with a DMARD, so that eventually she could stay off the prednisone.

This rhythm is also accompanied by some beta activity which occurs infrequently. There are also muscle contractions occurring at 4 Hz to 5 Hz which suggests possible Parkinson's. Part of the EEG is obscured by the muscle contraction artifact. There are also left temporal sharps occurring infrequently during the tracing. At one point of time, there was some slowing occurring in the right frontal head region.,ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:, Photic stimulation was performed and did not show any significant abnormality.,SLEEP PATTERNS:, No sleep architecture was observed during this tracing.,IMPRESSION:, This awake/alert/drowsy EEG is abnormal due to the presence of slowing in the right frontal head region, due to the presence of sharps arising in the left temporal head region, and due to the tremors. The slowing can be consistent with underlying structural abnormalities, so a stroke, subdural hematoma, etc., should be ruled out. The tremor probably represents a Parkinson's tremor and the sharps arising in the left temporal head region can potentially give way to seizures or may also represent underlying structural abnormalities, so clinical correlation is recommended.","sleep medicine, electroencephalography, eeg, hz rhythm, parkinson's tremor, photic stimulation, frontal head region, temporal head region, muscle contractions, seizures, parkinson's, temporal, "

He returns today to review his response to CPAP.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient initially presented with loud obnoxious snoring that disrupted the sleep of his bed partner.  He was found to have moderate-to-severe sleep apnea (predominantly hypopnea), was treated with nasal CPAP at 10 cm H2O nasal pressure.  He has been on CPAP now for several months, and returns for followup to review his response to treatment.,The patient reports that the CPAP has limited his snoring at night.  Occasionally, his bed partner wakes him in the middle of the night, when the mask comes off, and reminds him to replace the mask.  The patient estimates that he uses the CPAP approximately 5 to 7 nights per week, and on occasion takes it off and does not replace the mask when he awakens spontaneously in the middle of the night.,The patient's sleep pattern consists of going to bed between 11:00 and 11:30 at night and awakening between 6 to 7 a.m. on weekdays.

I have recommended the patient continue CPAP indefinitely.  He will be sending me his smart card for downloading to determine his CPAP usage pattern.  In addition, he will continue efforts to maintain his weight at current levels or below.  Should he succeed in reducing further, we might consider re-running a sleep study to determine whether he still requires a CPAP.,PLANS: , In the meantime, if it is also that the possible nasal obstruction is contributing to snoring and obstructive hypopnea.  I have recommended that a fiberoptic ENT exam be performed to exclude adenoidal tissue that may be contributing to obstruction.

Switch him to the Ritalin LA, which I think has better release of the medicine early in the morning or to increase his Adderall dose.  As far as the afternoon, if she really wanted him to be on the medication, we will do a small dose of the Adderall, which she would prefer.  So I have decided at this point to increase him to the Adderall XR 15 mg in the morning and then Adderall 5 mg in the afternoon.  Mother is to watch his diet.  We would like to recheck his weight if he is doing very well, in two months.  But if there are any problems, especially in the morning then we would do the Ritalin LA.  Mother understands and will call if there are problems.

He also fell about a week ago and is complaining of buttock pain and leg pain.  We did get x-rays of hips, knees, and ankles.  Clearly, he has significant degenerative disease in all these areas.

She actually turns 90 later this month, seen today for a short-term followup.  Actually, the main reasons we are seeing her back so soon which are elevated blood pressure and her right arm symptoms are basically resolved.  Blood pressure is better even though she is not currently on the higher dose Mavik likely recommended.  She apparently did not feel well with the higher dose, so she just went back to her previous dose of 1 mg daily.  She thinks, she also has an element of office hypertension.  Also, since she is on Mavik plus verapamil, she could switch over to the combined drug Tarka.  However, when we gave her samples of that she thought they were too big for her to swallow.  Basically, she is just back on her previous blood pressure regimen.  However, her blood pressure seems to be better today.  Her daughter says that they do check it periodically and it is similar to today‚Äôs reading.  Her right arm symptoms are basically resolved and she attributed that to her muscle problem back in the right shoulder blade.  We did do a C-spine and right shoulder x-ray and those just mainly showed some degenerative changes and possibly some rotator cuff injury with the humeral head quite high up in the glenoid in the right shoulder, but this does not seem to cause her any problems.  She has some vague ‚Äústomach problems‚Äù, although apparently it is improved when she stopped Aleve and she does not have any more aches or pains off Aleve.  She takes Tylenol p.r.n., which seems to be enough for her.  She does not think she has any acid reflux symptoms or heartburn.  She does take Tums t.i.d. and also Mylanta at night.  She has had dentures for many, many years and just recently I guess in the last few months, although she was somewhat vague on this, she has had some sores in her mouth.  They do heal up, but then she will get another one.  She also thinks since she has been on the Lexapro, she has somewhat of a tremor of her basically whole body at least upper body including the torso and arms and had all of the daughters who I not noticed to speak of and it is certainly difficult to tell her today that she has much tremor.

She says that Project Access is trying to find her a doctor.  She is not currently on Project Access, and so she is here to get something for the pain in her foot.  I did notice that she went in to see Dr. XYZ for a primary care physician on 05/14/2004.  She said she does not have a primary care physician.  She was in here just last week and saw Dr. XYZ for back pain and was put on pain medicines and muscle relaxers.  She has been in here multiple times for different kinds of pain.  This pain she is having is in her foot.  She had surgery on it, and she has plates and screws.  She said she was suppose to see Dr. XYZ about getting some of the hardware out of it.  The appointment was cancelled, and that is why she came here.  It started hurting a lot yesterday, but she had this previous appointment with Dr. XYZ so she thought she would take care of it there, but they would not see her.  She did not injure her foot in any way recently.  It is chronically painful.  Every time she does very much exercise it hurts more.  We have x-rayed it in the past.  She has some hardware there.  It does not appear to be grossly abnormal or causing any loosening or problems on x-ray.,PHYSICAL EXAM: , Examination of her foot shows some well-healed surgical scars.

It is mildly tender around the medial side of the foot just inferior to the medial malleolus.  It is not warm or red.,ASSESSMENT:,  Foot pain.,PLAN:,  She has been in here before.

She has a primary care physician, and now she is telling us she does not have a primary care physician even though she had seen Dr. XYZ not too long ago.  We called Dr. XYZ office.  Dr. XYZ nurse said that the patient did not have an appointment today.  She has an appointment on June 15, 2004, for a postop check.  They did not tell her they would not see her today because of insurance, so the patient was lying to me.  We will keep that in mind the next time she returns, because she will likely be back.

Laparoscopic fundoplication and gastrostomy was done because of the need for enteral feeding access and to protect her airway at a time when it is either going to heal enough to improve and allow decannulation or eventually prove that she will need laryngotracheoplasty.  Dr. X is following The patient for this and currently plans are to perform a repeat endoscopic exam every couple of months to assist the status of her airway caliber.,The patient had a laparoscopic fundoplication and gastrostomy on 10/05/2007.  She has done well since that time.  She has had some episodes of retching intermittently and these seemed to be unpredictable.  She also had some diarrhea and poor feeding tolerance about a week ago but that has also resolved.  The patient currently takes about 1 ounce to 1.5 ounce of her feedings by mouth and the rest is given by G-tube.  She seems otherwise happy and is not having an excessive amount of stools.  Her parents have not noted any significant problems with the gastrostomy site.,The patient's exam today is excellent.  Her belly is soft and nontender.  All of her laparoscopic trocar sites are healing with a normal amount of induration, but there is no evidence of hernia or infection.  We removed The patient's gastrostomy button today and showed her parents how to reinsert one without difficulty.  The site of the gastrostomy is excellent.  There is not even a hint of granulation tissue or erythema, and I am very happy with the overall appearance.,IMPRESSION: , The patient is doing exceptionally well status post laparoscope fundoplication and gastrostomy.  Hopefully, the exquisite control of acid reflux by fundoplication will help her airway heal, and if she does well, allow decannulation in the future.  If she does require laryngotracheoplasty, the protection from acid reflux will be important to healing of that procedure as well.,PLAN:  ,The patient will follow up as needed for problems related to gastrostomy.  We will see her when she comes in the hospital for endoscopic exams and possibly laryngotracheoplasty in the future.","soap / chart / progress notes, decannulation, enteral feeding, feeding access, laparoscopic fundoplication, gastrostomy, airway, laryngotracheoplasty, laparoscopic, fundoplication, "

The patient states that her husband has been diagnosed with high blood cholesterol as well.  She wants some support with some dietary recommendations to assist both of them in healthier eating.  The two of them live alone now, and she is used to cooking for large portions.  She is having a hard time adjusting to preparing food for the two of them.  She would like to do less food preparation, in fact.  She is starting a new job this week.,OBJECTIVE:,  Her reported height is 5 feet 4 inches.  Today‚Äôs weight was 170 pounds.  BMI is approximately 29.  A diet history was obtained.  I instructed the patient on a 1200 calorie meal plan emphasizing low-saturated fat sources with moderate amounts of sodium as well.  Information on fast food eating was supplied, and additional information on low-fat eating was also supplied.,ASSESSMENT:,  The patient‚Äôs basal energy expenditure is estimated at 1361 calories a day.  Her total calorie requirement for weight maintenance is estimated at 1759 calories a day.  Her diet history reflects that she is making some very healthy food choices on a regular basis.  She does emphasize a lot of fruits and vegetables, trying to get a fruit or a vegetable or both at most meals.  She also is emphasizing lower fat selections.  Her physical activity level is moderate at this time.  She is currently walking for 20 minutes four or five days out of the week but at a very moderate pace with a friend.  We reviewed the efforts at weight reduction identifying 3500 calories in a pound of body fat and the need to gradually and slowly chip away at this number on a long-term basis for weight reduction.  We discussed the need to reduce calories from what her current patterns are and to hopefully increase physical activity slightly as well.  We discussed menu selection, as well as food preparation techniques.  The patient appears to have been influenced by the current low-carb, high-protein craze and had really limited her food selections based on that.  I was able to give her some more room for variety including some moderate portions of potatoes, pasta and even on occasion breading her meat as long as she prepares it in a low-fat fashion which was discussed.,PLAN:,  Recommend the patient increase the intensity and the duration of her physical activity with a goal of 30 minutes five days a week working at a brisk walk.  Recommend the patient reduce calories by 500 daily to support a weight loss of one pound a week.  This translates into a 1200-calorie meal plan.  I encouraged the patient to keep food records in order to better track calories consumed.  I recommended low fat selections and especially those that are lower in saturated fats.  Emphasis would be placed on moderating portions of meat and having more moderate snacks between meals as well.  This was a one-hour consultation.  I provided my name and number should additional needs arise.","soap / chart / progress notes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease, weight reduction, dietary recommendations, healthier eating, meal plan, dietary consultation, low fat, physical activity, weight, gastroesophageal, dietary, calories, food"

758,1016,1408," Followup dietary consultation for hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and possible metabolic syndrome", SOAP / Chart / Progress Notes,3, Dietary Consult - Hyperlipidemia ,"SUBJECTIVE:,  This is a followup dietary consultation for hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and possible metabolic syndrome.  The patient reports that she has worked hard for a number of weeks following the meal plan prescribed, but felt like she was gaining weight and not losing weight on it.  She is not sure that she was following it accurately.  She is trying to walk 1-1/2 to 2 miles every other day, but is increasing her time in the garden and doing other yard work as well.  Once she started experiencing some weight gain, she went back to her old South Beach Diet and felt like she was able to take some of that weight off.  However she realizes that the South Beach Diet is not a healthy diet for her and so is coming back for better instruction on safe weight loss and low-fat eating.,OBJECTIVE:,  Weight is 275 pounds.  Food records were reviewed.,ASSESSMENT:,  The patient experienced a weight gain of 2 pounds since our last consultation which was two months ago.  I did carefully review her food records and evaluated calories consumed.  While she was carefully tracking the volume of protein and carbohydrates, she was getting some excess calories from the fatty proteins selected.  Thus we rearranged her meal plan a little bit and talked about how to track her fat calories as well.  She was more open to reducing the amount of protein from the previous meal plan and increasing slightly the amount of carbohydrates.  While this still is not as much carbohydrate as I would normally recommend, I am certainly willing to work with her on how she feels her body best handles weight reduction.  We also discussed a snack that could be eliminated in the morning because she really is not hungry at that time.,PLAN:,  A new 1500 calorie meal plan was developed based on 35% of the calories coming from protein, 40% of the calories from carbohydrate, and 25% of the calories from fat.  This translates in to 10 servings at 15 grams a piece of carbohydrates throughout the day dividing them in to groups of two servings per meal and per snack.  This also translates in to 2 ounces of protein at breakfast, 6 ounces at lunch, 2 ounces in the afternoon snack, 6 ounces at supper, and 2 ounces in the evening snack.  We have eliminated the morning snack.  The patient will now track the grams of fat in her meats as well as added fats.  Her goal for total fats over the course of the day is no more than 42 grams of fat per day.  This was a half hour consultation.  We will plan to see the patient back in one month for support.","soap / chart / progress notes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, meal, food records, south beach diet, dietary consultation, meal plan, carbohydrates, snack, dietary, calories, weight"

Patient reports that she is scared to eat because of its impact on her blood sugars.  She is actually trying not to eat while she is working third shift at Wal-Mart.  Historically however, she likes to eat out with a high frequency.  She enjoys eating rice as part of her meals.  She is complaining of feeling fatigued and tired all the time because she works from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. at Wal-Mart and has young children at home.  She sleeps two to four hours at a time throughout the day.  She has been testing for ketones first thing in the morning when she gets home from work.,OBJECTIVE:,  Today's weight:  155.5 pounds.  Weight from 10/07/04 was 156.7 pounds.  A diet history was obtained.  Blood sugar records for the last three days reveal the following:  fasting blood sugars 83, 84, 87, 77; two-hour postprandial breakfast 116, 107, 97; pre-lunch 85, 108, 77; two-hour postprandial lunch 86, 131, 100; pre-supper 78, 91, 100; two-hour postprandial supper 125, 121, 161; bedtime 104, 90 and 88.

A sample 2000-calorie meal plan was provided with a carbohydrate budget established.,ASSESSMENT:,  Patient's basal energy expenditure adjusted for obesity is estimated at 1336 calories a day.  Her total calorie requirements, including a physical activity factor as well as additional calories for pregnancy, totals to 2036 calories per day.  Her diet history reveals that she has somewhat irregular eating patterns.  In the last 24 hours when she was working at Wal-Mart, she ate at 5 a.m. but did not eat anything prior to that since starting work at 10 p.m.  We discussed the need for small frequent eating.  We identified carbohydrate as the food source that contributes to the blood glucose response.  We identified carbohydrate sources in the food supply, recognizing that they are all good for her.  The only carbohydrates she was asked to entirely avoid would be the concentrated forms of refined sugars.  In regard to use of her traditional foods of rice, I pulled out a one-third cup measuring cup to identify a 15-gram equivalent of rice.  We discussed the need for moderating the portion of carbohydrates consumed at one given time.  Emphasis was placed at eating with a high frequency with a goal of eating every two to four hours over the course of the day when she is awake.  Her weight loss was discouraged.  Patient was encouraged to eat more generously but with attention to the amount of carbohydrates consumed at a time.,PLAN:,  The meal plan provided has a carbohydrate content that represents 40 percent of a 2000-calorie meal plan.  The meal plan was devised to distribute her carbohydrates more evenly throughout the day.  The meal plan was meant to reflect an example for her eating, while the patient was encouraged to eat according to appetite and not to go without eating for long periods of time.  The meal plan is as follows:  breakfast 2 carbohydrate servings, snack 1 carbohydrate serving, lunch 2-3 carbohydrate servings, snack 1 carbohydrate serving, dinner 2-3 carbohydrate servings, bedtime snack 1-2 carbohydrate servings.  Recommend patient include a solid protein with each of her meals as well as with her snack that occurs before going to sleep.  Encouraged adequate rest.  Also recommend adequate calories to sustain weight gain of one-half to one pound per week.  If the meal plan reflected does not support slow gradual weight gain, then we will need to add more foods accordingly.  This was a one-hour consultation.

Her total calorie requirements, including physical activity factors as well as additional calories for pregnancy, totals 2367 calories a day.  Her diet history reveals that she is eating three meals a day and three snacks.  The snacks were just added last week following presence of ketones in her urine.  We identified carbohydrate sources in the food supply, recognizing that they are the foods that raise blood sugar the most.  We identified 15 gram equivalents of carbohydrate and established a carbohydrate budget.  We also discussed the goal of balancing food intake with blood sugar control and adequate caloric intake to sustain appropriate weight gain for the pregnancy of 1/2 a pound a week through the duration of the pregnancy.  We discussed the physiology of ketone production from inadequate calories or inadequate insulin and elevated blood sugars.  While a sample meal plan was provided reflecting the patient‚Äôs carbohydrate budget I emphasized the need for her to eat according to her appetite, but to work at consistency in the volume of carbohydrates consumed at a given meal or a given snack from day to day.  Patient was assured that we can titrate the insulin to match whatever eating pattern is suitable for her as long as she can do it on a consistent basis.  At the same time she was encouraged to continue to eliminate the more concentrated forms of refined carbohydrates.,PLAN:,  Recommend the patient work with the following meal plan with a carbohydrate budget representing approximately 45% of the calories from carbohydrate.

773,1032,1430," Patient with hip pain, osteoarthritis, lumbar spondylosis, chronic sacroiliitis, etc.", SOAP / Chart / Progress Notes,3, Chiropractic Progress Note ,"CHIEF COMPLAINT:  ,Hip pain.,HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:  ,The patient is a very pleasant 41-year-old white female that is known to me previously from our work at the Pain Management Clinic, as well as from my residency training program, San Francisco. We have worked collaboratively for many years at the Pain Management Clinic and with her departure there, she has asked to establish with me for clinic pain management at my office.  She reports moderate to severe pain related to a complicated past medical history.  In essence, she was seen at a very young age at the clinic for bilateral knee and hip pain and diagnosed with bursitis at age 23.  She was given nonsteroidals at that time, which did help with this discomfort.  With time, however, this became inadequate and she was seen later in San Francisco in her mid 30s by Dr. V, an orthopedist who diagnosed retroverted hips at Hospital.  She was referred for rehabilitation and strengthening.  Most of this was focused on her SI joints.  At that time, although she had complained of foot discomfort, she was not treated for it.  This was in 1993 after which she and her new husband moved to the Boston area, where she lived from 1995-1996.  She was seen at the Pain Center by Dr. R with similar complaints of hip and knee pain.  She was seen by rheumatologists there and diagnosed with osteoarthritis as well as osteophytosis of the back.  Medications at that time were salicylate and Ultram.,When she returned to Portland in 1996, she was then working for Dr. B.  She was referred to a podiatrist by her local doctor who found several fractured sesamoid bones in her both feet, but this was later found not to be the case.  Subsequently, nuclear bone scans revealed osteoarthritis.  Orthotics were provided.  She was given Paxil and Tramadol and subsequently developed an unfortunate side effect of grand mal seizure.  During this workup of her seizure, imaging studies revealed a pericardial fluid-filled cyst adhered to her ventricle.  She has been advised not to undergo any corrective or reparative surgery as well as to limit her activities since.  She currently does not have an established cardiologist having just changed insurance plans.  She is establishing care with Dr. S, of Rheumatology for her ongoing care.  Up until today, her pain medications were being written by Dr. Y prior to establishing with Dr. L.,Pain management in town had been first provided by the office of Dr. F. Under his care, followup MRIs were done which showed ongoing degenerative disc disease, joint disease, and facet arthropathy in addition to previously described sacroiliitis.  A number of medications were attempted there, including fentanyl patches with Flonase from 25 mcg titrated upwards to 50 mcg, but this caused oversedation.  She then transferred her care to Ab Cd, FNP under the direction of Dr. K.  Her care there was satisfactory, but because of her work schedule, the patient found this burdensome as well as the guidelines set forth in terms of monthly meetings and routine urine screens.  Because of a previous commitment, she was unable to make one unscheduled request to their office in order to produce a random urine screen and was therefore discharged.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,1.

778,1038,1442, Dietary consultation for carbohydrate counting for type I diabetes., SOAP / Chart / Progress Notes,3, Carbohydrate Counting ,"SUBJECTIVE:,  This is a 62-year-old female who comes for dietary consultation for carbohydrate counting for type I diabetes.  The patient reports that she was hospitalized over the weekend for DKA.  She indicates that her blood sugar on Friday night was 187 at bedtime and that when she woke up in the morning her blood sugar was 477.  She gave herself, in smaller increments, a total of 70 extra units of her Humalog.  Ten of those units were injectable; the others were in the forms of pump.  Her blood sugar was over 600 when she went to the hospital later that day.  She is here at this consultation complaining of not feeling well still because she has a cold.  She realizes that this is likely because her immune system was so minimized in the hospital.,OBJECTIVE:,  Current insulin doses on her insulin pump are boluses set at 5 units at breakfast, 6 units at lunch and 11 units at supper.  Her basal rates have not been changed since her last visit with Charla Yassine and totaled 30.5 units per 24 hours.  A diet history was obtained.  I instructed the patient on carbohydrate counting at 1 unit of insulin for every 10 g carbohydrate ratio was recommended.  A correction dose of approximately 1 unit of insulin to bring the blood sugars down 30 mg/dl was also recommended.  The Lilly guide for meal planning was provided and reviewed.  Additional carbohydrate counting book was provided.,ASSESSMENT:,  The patient was taught an insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio of 1 unit to 10 g of carbohydrates as recommended at the previous visit two years ago, which she does not recall.  It is based on the 500 rule which suggests this ratio.  We did identify carbohydrate sources in the food supply, recognizing 15-g equivalents.  We also identified the need to dose her insulin at the time that she is eating her carbohydrate sources.  She does seem to have a pattern of fixing blood sugars later in the day after they are elevated.  We discussed the other option of trying to eat a consistent amount of carbohydrates at meals from day to day and taking a consistent amount of insulin at those meals.  With this in mind, she was recommended to follow with three servings or 45 g of carbohydrate at breakfast, three servings or 45 g of carbohydrate at lunch and four servings or 60 g of carbohydrate at dinner.  Joanne Araiza joined our consultation briefly to discuss whether her pump was working appropriately.  The patient was given an 800 number for the pump to contact should there be any question about its failure to deliver insulin appropriately.,PLAN:,  Recommend the patient use 1 unit of insulin for every 10-g carbohydrate load consumed.  Recommend the patient either use this as a carbohydrate counting tool or work harder at keeping carbohydrate content consistent at meals from day to day.  This was a one-hour consultation.  Provided my name and number should additional needs arise.","soap / chart / progress notes, insulin pump, carbohydrate load, immune system, dietary consultation, carbohydrate ratio, blood sugars, carbohydrate counting, carbohydrate, dietary, blood, counting, insulin"

She tells me cataract extraction has been recommended in each eye; however, she is nervous to have surgery.  Past ocular surgery history is significant for neurovascular age-related macular degeneration.  She states she has had laser four times to the macula on the right and two times to the left, she sees Dr. X for this.,OBJECTIVE: , On examination, visual acuity with correction measures 20/400 OU.  Manifest refraction does not improve this.  There is no afferent pupillary defect.  Visual fields are grossly full to hand motions.  Intraocular pressure measures 17 mm in each eye.  Slit-lamp examination is significant for clear corneas OU.  There is early nuclear sclerosis in both eyes.  There is a sheet like 1-2+ posterior subcapsular cataract on the left.  Dilated examination shows choroidal neovascularization with subretinal heme and blood in both eyes.,ASSESSMENT/PLAN:  ,Advanced neurovascular age-related macular degeneration OU, this is ultimately visually limiting.  Cataracts are present in both eyes.  I doubt cataract removal will help increase visual acuity; however, I did discuss with the patient, especially in the left, cataract surgery will help Dr. X better visualize the macula for future laser treatment so that her current vision can be maintained.

She comes in this morning with complaints of inability to swallow anything including her saliva.  This started almost a day earlier.  She was eating lunch and had beef stew and suddenly noticed inability to finish her meal and since then has not been able to eat anything.  She is on Coumadin and her INR is 2.5.,OPERATIVE NOTE: , Informed consent was obtained from patient.  The risks of aspiration, bleeding, perforation, infection, and serious risk including need for surgery and ICU stay particularly in view of food impaction for almost a day was discussed.  Daughter was also informed about the procedure and risks.  Conscious sedation initially was administered with Versed 2 mg and fentanyl 50 mcg.  The scope was advanced into the esophagus and showed liquid and solid particles from mid esophagus all the way to the distal esophagus.  There was a meat bolus in the distal esophagus.  This was visualized after clearing the liquid material and small particles of what appeared to be carrots.  The patient, however, was not tolerating the conscious sedation.  Hence, Dr. X was consulted and we continued the procedure with propofol sedation.,The scope was reintroduced into the esophagus after propofol sedation.  Initially a Roth net was used and some small amounts of soft food in the distal esophagus was removed with the Roth net.  Then, a snare was used to cut the meat bolus into pieces, as it was very soft.  Small pieces were grabbed with the snare and pulled out.  Thereafter, the residual soft meat bolus was passed into the stomach along with the scope, which was passed between the bolus and the esophageal wall carefully.  The patient had severe bruising and submucosal hemorrhage in the esophagus possibly due to longstanding bolus impaction and Coumadin therapy.  No active bleeding was seen.  There was a distal esophageal stricture, which caused slight resistance to the passage of the scope into the stomach.  As this area was extremely inflamed, a dilatation was not attempted.,IMPRESSION: , Distal esophageal stricture with food impaction.  Treated as described above.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,  IV Protonix 40 mg q.12h.  Clear liquid diet for 24 hours.

An extramedullary tibial cutting jig was pinned to the proximal tibia in the appropriate alignment and flush cut was made along tibial plateau, perpendicular to the axis of the tibia.  Its alignment was checked with the rod and found to be adequate.  The tibia was then allowed to relocate under the femur.,An intramedullary hole was drilled into the femur and a femoral rod attached to the anterior cutting block was inserted, and the block was pinned in appropriate position, judging correct rotation using a variety of techniques.  An anterior rough cut was made.  The distal cutting jig was placed atop this cut surface and pinned to the distal femur, and the rod was removed.  The distal cut was performed.,A spacer block was placed, and adequate balance in extension was adjusted and confirmed, as was knee alignment.  Femoral sizing was performed with the sizer, and the appropriate size femoral 4-in-1 chamfer-cutting block was pinned in place and the cuts were made.  The notch-cutting block was pinned to the cut surface, slightly laterally, and the notch cut was then made.  The trial femoral component was impacted onto the distal femur and found to have an excellent fit.  A trial tibial plate and polyethylene were inserted, and stability was judged and found to be adequate in all planes.  Appropriate rotation of the tibial component was identified and marked.  The trials were removed and the tibia was brought forward again.  The tibial plate size was checked and the plate was pinned to plateau.  A keel guide was placed and the keel was then made.  The femoral intramedullary hole was plugged with bone from the tibia.  The trial tibial component and poly placed; and, after placement of the femoral component, range of motion and stability were checked and found to be adequate in various ranges of flexion and extension.,The patella was held in a slightly everted position with knee in extension.  Patellar width was checked with calipers.  A free-hand cut of the patellar articular surface was performed and checked to ensure symmetry with the calipers.  Sizing was then performed and 3 lug holes were drilled with the jig in place, taking care to medialize and superiorize the component as much as possible, given bony anatomy.  Any excess lateral patellar bone was recessed.  The trial patellar component was placed and found to have adequate tracking.  The trials were removed; and as the cement was mixed, all cut surfaces were thoroughly washed and dried.  The cement was applied to the components and the cut surfaces with digital pressurization, and then the components were impacted.  The excess cement was removed from the gutters and anterior and posterior parts of the knee.  The knee was brought into full extension with the trial polyethylene and further axially pressurized as cement hardened.  Once the cement had hardened, the tourniquet was deflated.  The knee was dislocated again, and any excess cement was removed with an osteotome.  Thorough irrigation and hemostasis were performed.  The real polyethylene component was placed and pinned.  Further vigorous power irrigation was performed, and adequate hemostasis was obtained and confirmed.  The arthrotomy was closed using 0 Ethibond and Vicryl sutures.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed after further irrigation with 2-0 Vicryl and Monocryl sutures.  The skin was sealed with staples.  Xeroform and a sterile dressing were applied followed by a cold-pack and Ace wrap.  The patient was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition, having tolerated the procedure well.","surgery, proximal medial tibia, total knee replacement, parapatellar arthrotomy, subcutaneous tissues, tibial plateau, incision, cutting, patella, femur, femoral, component, knee,"

Risks, benefits, alternatives of the procedures were discussed in great detail with the patient.  Risks include but were not limited to anesthesia, bleeding, infection, injury to nerve, vocal fold paralysis, hoarseness, low calcium, need for calcium supplementation, tumor recurrence, need for additional treatment, need for thyroid medication, cosmetic deformity, and other.  The patient understood all these issues and they wished to proceed.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS: , Multinodular thyroid goiter with compressive symptoms and bilateral dominant thyroid nodules proven to be benign by fine needle aspiration.,POSTOP DIAGNOSIS: , Multinodular thyroid goiter with compressive symptoms and bilateral dominant thyroid nodules proven to be benign by fine needle aspiration.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,PROCEDURE DETAIL: , After identifying the patient, the patient was placed supine in a operating room table.  After establishing general anesthesia via oral endotracheal intubation with a 6 Nerve Integrity monitoring system endotracheal tube.  The eyes were then tacked with Tegaderm.  The Nerve Integrity monitoring system, endotracheal tube was confirmed to be working adequately.  Essentially a 7 cm incision was employed in the lower skin crease of the neck.  A 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine were given.  Shoulder roll was applied.  The patient prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  A 15-blade was used to make the incision.  Subplatysmal flaps were raised to the thyroid notch and sternal respectively.  The strap muscles were separated in the midline.  As we then turned to the left side where the sternohyoid muscle was separated from the sternothyroid muscle there was a very dense and firm thyroid mass on the left side.  The sternothyroid muscle was transected horizontally.  Similar procedure was performed on the right side.,Attention was then turned to identify the trachea in the midline.  Veins in this area and the pretracheal region were ligated with a harmonic scalpel.  Subsequently, attention was turned to dissecting the capsule off of the left thyroid lobe.  Again this was very firm in nature.  The superior thyroid pole was dissected in the superior third artery, vein, and the individual vessels were ligated with a harmonic scalpel.  The inferior and superior parathyroid glands were protected.  Recurrent laryngeal nerve was identified in the tracheoesophageal groove.  This had arborized early as a course underneath the inferior thyroid artery to a very small tiny anterior motor branch.  This was followed superiorly.  The level of cricothyroid membrane upon complete visualization of the entire nerve, Berry's ligament was transected and the nerve protected and then the thyroid gland was dissected over the trachea.  A prominent pyramidal level was also appreciated and dissected as well.,Attention was then turned to the right side.  There was significant amount of thyroid tissue that was very firm.  Multiple nodules were appreciated.  In a similar fashion, the capsule was dissected.  The superior and inferior parathyroid glands protected and preserved.  The superior thyroid artery and vein were individually ligated with the harmonic scalpel and the inferior thyroid artery was then ligated close to the thyroid gland capsule.  Once the recurrent laryngeal nerve was identified again on this side, the nerve had arborized early prior to the coursing underneath the inferior thyroid artery.  The anterior motor branch was then very fine, almost filamentous and stimulated at 0.5 milliamps, completely dissected toward the cricothyroid membrane with complete visualization.  A small amount of tissue was left at the Berry's ligament as the remainder of thyroid level was dissected over the trachea.  The entire thyroid specimen was then removed, marked with a stitch upon the superior pole.  The wound was copiously irrigated, Valsalva maneuver was given, bleeding points controlled.  The parathyroid glands appeared to be viable.  Both the anterior motor branches that were tiny were stimulated at 5 milliamps and confirmed to be working with the Nerve Integrity monitoring system.,Attention was then turned to burying the Surgicel on the wound bed on both sides.  The strap muscles were reapproximated in the midline using a 3-0 Vicryl suture of the sternothyroid horizontal transection and the strap muscles in the midline were then reapproximated.  The 1/8th inch Hemovac drain was placed and secured with a 3-0 nylon.  The incision was then closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl and Indermil for the skin.  The patient has a history of keloid formation and approximately 1 cubic centimeter of 40 mg per cubic centimeter Kenalog was injected into the incisional line using a tuberculin syringe and 25-gauge needle.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, was extubated in the operating room table, and sent to postanesthesia care unit in a good condition.  Upon completion of the case, fiberoptic laryngoscopy revealed intact bilateral true vocal fold mobility.","surgery, total thyroidectomy, goiter, multinodular thyroid goiter, multinodular, thyroid nodules, parathyroid glands, thyroid goiter, thyroid artery, thyroidectomy"

Placement of SynchroMed infusion pump.,2.  Tunneling of SynchroMed infusion pump catheter,3.  Anchoring of the intrathecal catheter and connecting of the right lower quadrant SynchroMed pump catheter to the intrathecal catheter.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , Under general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was placed in a lateral decubitus position.  The patient was prepped and draped in a sterile manner.  The intrathecal catheter was placed via a percutaneous approach by the pain management specialist at which point an incision was made adjacent to the needle containing the intrathecal catheter.  This incision was carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue to the paraspinous muscle fascia which was cleared around the entry point of the intrathecal catheter needle.  A pursestring suture of 3-0 Prolene was placed around the needle in the paraspinous muscle.  The needle was withdrawn.  The pursestring suture was tied to snug the tissues around the catheter and prevent cerebrospinal fluid leak.  The catheter demonstrated free flow of cerebrospinal fluid,throughout the RV procedure.  The catheter was anchored to the paraspinous muscle with an anchoring device using interrupted sutures of 3-0 Prolene.  Antibiotic irrigation and antibiotic soak sponge were placed into the wound, and the catheter was clamped to prevent persistent leakage of cerebrospinal fluid while the SynchroMed-pump pocket was created.  Then, I turned my attention to the anterior abdominal wall where an oblique incision was made and carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue to the external oblique fascia, which was freed from attachments to the overlying subcutaneous tissue utilizing blunt and sharp dissection with electrocautery.  A pocket was created that would encompass the SynchroMed fusion pump.  A tunneling device was then passed through the subcutaneous tissue from the back incision to the abdominal incision, and a SynchroMed pump catheter was placed to the tunneling device.  The tunneling device was then removed leaving the SynchroMed pump catheter extending from the anterior abdominal wall incision to the posterior back incision.  The intrathecal catheter was trimmed.  A clear plastic boot was placed over the intrathecal catheter, and the connecting device was advanced from the SynchroMed pump catheter into the intrathecal catheter connecting the 2 catheters together.  The clear plastic boot was then placed over the connection, and it was anchored in place with 0-silk ties.  Good CSF was then demonstrated flowing through the SynchroMed pump catheter.  The SynchroMed pump catheter was connected to the SynchroMed pump and anchored in place with a 0-silk tie.  Excess catheter was coiled and placed behind the pump.  The pump was placed into the subcutaneous pocket created for it on the anterior abdominal wall.  The pump was anchored to the anterior abdominal wall fascia with interrupted sutures of 2-0 Prolene; 4 of the sutures were placed.  The subcutaneous tissues were irrigated with normal saline.  The subcutaneous tissue of both wounds was closed with running suture of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin of both wounds was closed with staples.  Antibiotic ointment and a sterile dressing were applied.  The patient was awake and taken to the recovery room.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was stable at the completion of the procedure.  All sponge and lap, needle and instrument counts were correct at the completion of the procedure.","surgery, intrathecal, catheter, paraspinous, cerebrospinal, synchromed infusion pump, synchromed pump catheter, synchromed pump, paraspinous muscle, cerebrospinal fluid, tunneling device, infusion pump, subcutaneous tissue, infusion, synchromed, pump, incision,"

Once anesthesia was achieved, the right eye was prepped with Betadine, rinsed with saline, and draped in a sterile fashion.  A lid speculum was placed and 4-0 silk sutures passed under the superior and inferior rectus muscles stabilizing the globe.  A fornix-based conjunctival flap was prepared superiorly from 10 to 12 o'clock and episcleral vessels were cauterized using a wet-field.  A surgical groove was applied with a 69 Beaver blade 1 mm posterior to the limbus in a frown configuration in the 10 to 12 o'clock position.  A lamellar dissection was carried anteriorly to clear cornea using a crescent knife.  A stab incision was applied with a Superblade at the 2 o'clock position at the limbus.  The chamber was also entered through the lamellar groove using a 3-mm keratome in a beveled fashion.  Viscoat was injected into the chamber and an anterior capsulorrhexis performed.  Hydrodissection was used to delineate the nucleus and the phacoemulsification tip was inserted into the chamber.  A deep linear groove was dissected through the nucleus vertically and the nucleus was rotated 90 degrees with the assistance of a spatula through the side-port incision.  A second groove was dissected perpendicular to the first and the nucleus was fractured into quadrants.  Each quadrant was emulsified under burst power within the capsular bag.  The epinuclear bowl was manipulated with vacuum, flipped into the iris plane, and emulsified under pulse power.  I&A was used to aspirate cortex from the capsular bag.  A scratcher was used to polish the capsule, and Viscoat was injected inflating the capsular bag and chamber.  The wound was enlarged with a shortcut blade to 5.5 mm.

The left neck and chest were prepped and draped in the usual manner and the skin and subcutaneous tissues below the left clavicle were infiltrated with 1% lidocaine for local anesthesia. A 2-1/2-inch incision was made below the left clavicle and electrocautery was used for hemostasis. Dissection was carried out to the level of the pectoralis fascia and extended caudally to create a pocket for the pulse generator. The deltopectoral groove was explored and a medium-sized cephalic vein was identified. The distal end of the vein was ligated and a venotomy was performed. Two guide wires were advanced to the superior vena cava and peel-away introducer sheaths were used to insert the two pacing leads. The venous pressures were elevated and there was a fair amount of back-bleeding from the vein, so a 3-0 Monocryl figure-of-eight stitch was placed around the tissue surrounding the vein for hemostasis.

The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  An incision was made in the groin crease overlying the internal ring.  This incision was about 1.5 cm in length.  The incision was carried down through the Scarpa's layer to the level of the external oblique.  This was opened along the direction of its fibers and carried down along the external spermatic fascia.  The cremasteric fascia was then incised and the internal spermatic fascia was grasped and pulled free.  A hernia sac was identified and the testicle was located.  Next the internal spermatic fascia was incised and the hernia sac was dissected free inside the internal ring.  This was performed by incising the transversalis fascia circumferentially.  The hernia sac was ligated with a 3-0 silk suture high and divided and was noted to retract into the abdominal cavity.  Care was taken not to injure the testicular vessels.  Next the abnormal attachments of the testicle were dissected free distally with care not to injure any long loop vas and these were divided beneath the testicle for a fair distance.  The lateral attachments tethering the cord vessels were freed from the sidewalls in the retroperitoneum high.  This gave excellent length and very adequate length to bring the testicle down into the anterior superior hemiscrotum.  The testicle was viable.  This was wrapped in a moist sponge.,Next a hemostat was passed down through the inguinal canal down into the scrotum.  A small 1 cm incision was made in the anterior superior scrotal wall.  Dissection was carried down through the dartos layer.  A subdartos pouch was formed with blunt dissection.  The hemostat was then pushed against the tissues and this tissue was divided.  The hemostat was then passed through the incision.  A Crile hemostat was passed back up into the inguinal canal.  The distal attachments of the sac were grasped and pulled down without twisting these structures through the incision.  The neck was then closed with a 4-0 Vicryl suture that was not too tight, but tight enough to prevent retraction of the testicle.  The testicle was then tucked down in its proper orientation into the subdartos pouch and the subcuticular tissue was closed with a running 4-0 chromic and the skin was closed with a running 6-0 subcuticular chromic suture.  Benzoin and a Steri-Strip were placed.  Next the transversus abdominis arch was reapproximated to the iliopubic tract over the top of the cord vessels to tighten up the ring slightly.

Posterior leaflet abscess resection.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General endotracheal anesthesia,TIMES:  ,Aortic cross-clamp time was ** minutes.  Cardiopulmonary bypass time total was ** minutes.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, the patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered.  Next, the patient's chest and legs were prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion.  A #10-blade scalpel was used to make a midline median sternotomy incision.  Dissection was carried down to the level of the sternum using Bovie electrocautery.  The sternum was opened with a sternal saw, and full-dose heparinization was given.  Next, the chest retractor was positioned.  The pericardium was opened with Bovie electrocautery and pericardial stay sutures were positioned.  We then prepared to place the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass.  A 2-0 Ethibond double pursestring was placed in the ascending aorta.  Through this was passed our aortic cannula and connected to the arterial side of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine.  Next, double cannulation with venous cannulas was instituted.  A 3-0 Prolene pursestring was placed in the right atrial appendage.  Through this was passed our SEC cannula.  This was connected to the venous portion of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine in a Y-shaped circuit.  Next, a 3-0 Prolene pursestring was placed in the lower border of the right atrium.  Through this was passed our inferior vena cava cannula.  This was likewise connected to the Y connection of our venous cannula portion.  We then used a 4-0 U-stitch in the right atrium for our retrograde cardioplegia catheter, which was inserted.  Cardiopulmonary bypass was instituted.  Metzenbaum scissors were used to dissect out the SVC and IVC, which were subsequently encircled with umbilical tape.  Sondergaard's groove was taken down.  Next, an antegrade cardioplegia needle and associated sump were placed in the ascending aorta.  This was connected appropriately as was the retrograde cardioplegia catheter.  Next, the aorta was cross-clamped, and antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia was infused so as to arrest the heart in diastole.  Next a #15-blade scalpel was used to open the left atrium.  The left atrium was decompressed with pump sucker.  Next, our self-retaining retractor was positioned so as to bring the mitral valve up into view.  Of note was the fact that the mitral valve P2 segment of the posterior leaflet had an abscess associated with it.  The borders of the P2 segment abscess were defined by using a right angle to define the chordae which were encircled with a 4-0 silk.  After doing so, the P2 segment of the posterior leaflet was excised with a #11-blade scalpel.  Given the laxity of the posterior leaflet, it was decided to reconstruct it with a 2-0 Ethibond pledgeted suture.  This was done so as to reconstruct the posterior annular portion.  Prior to doing so, care was taken to remove any debris and abscess-type material.  The pledgeted stitch was lowered into place and tied.  Next, the more anterior portion of the P2 segment was reconstructed by running a 4-0 Prolene stitch so as to reconstruct it.  This was done without difficulty.  The apposition of the anterior and posterior leaflet was confirmed by infusing solution into the left ventricle.  There was noted to be a small amount of central regurgitation.  It was felt that this would be corrected with our annuloplasty portion of the procedure.  Next, 2-0 non-pledgeted Ethibond sutures were placed in the posterior portion of the annulus from trigone to trigone in interrupted fashion.  Care was taken to go from trigone to trigone.  Prior to placing these sutures, the annulus was sized and noted to be a *** size for the Cosgrove-Galloway suture band ring from Medtronic.  After, as mentioned, we placed our interrupted sutures in the annulus, and they were passed through the CG suture band.  The suture band was lowered into position and tied in place.  We then tested our repair and noted that there was very mild regurgitation.  We subsequently removed our self-retaining retractor.  We closed our left atriotomy using 4-0 Prolene in a running fashion.  This was done without difficulty.  We de-aired the heart.  We then gave another round of antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia in warm fashion.  The aortic cross-clamp was removed, and the heart gradually resumed electromechanical activity.  We then removed our retrograde cardioplegia catheter from the coronary sinus and buttressed this site with a 5-0 Prolene.  We placed 2 ventricular and 2 atrial pacing leads which were brought out through the skin.  The patient was gradually weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass and our venous cannulas were removed.  We then gave full-dose protamine; and after noting that there was no evidence of a protamine reaction, we removed our aortic cannula.  This site was buttressed with a 4-0 Prolene on an SH needle.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  We placed a mediastinal #32-French chest tube as well as a right chest Blake drain.  The mediastinum was inspected for any signs of bleeding.  There were none.  We closed the sternum with #7 sternal wires in interrupted figure-of-eight fashion.  The fascia was closed with a #1 Vicryl followed by a 2-0 Vicryl, followed by 3-0 Vicryl in a running subcuticular fashion.  The instrument and sponge count was correct at the end of the case.

The patient had been followed for a period of time and underwent rapid development of a left and right infraclavicular lymphadenopathy and central neck lymphadenopathy also with imaging studies to suggest superior mediastinal disease.  Fine-needle aspiration of the left and right infraclavicular lymph nodes revealed persistent medullary thyroid cancer.  Risks, benefits, and alternatives of the procedures discussed with in detail and the patient elected to proceed with surgery as discussed.  The risks included, but not limited to anesthesia, bleeding, infection, injury to nerve, lip, tongue, shoulder, weakness, tongue numbness, droopy eyelid, tumor comes back, need for additional treatment, diaphragm weakness, pneumothorax, need for chest tube, others.  The patient understood all these issues and did wish to proceed.,PROCEDURE DETAIL:  ,After identifying the patient, the patient was placed supine on the operating room table.  The patient was intubated with a number 7 nerve integrity monitor system endotracheal tube.  The eyes were protected with Tegaderm.  The patient was rotated to 180 degrees towards the operating surgeon.  The Foley catheter was placed into the bladder with good return of urine.  Attention then was turned to securing the nerve integrity monitor system endotracheal tube and this was confirmed to be working adequately.  A previous apron incision was incorporated and advanced over onto the right side to the mastoid tip.  The incision then was planned around the old scar to be excised.  A 1% lidocaine with 1 to 100,000 epinephrine was injected.  A shoulder roll was applied.  The incision was made, the apron flap was raised to the level of the mandible and mastoid tip bilaterally all the way down to the clavicle and sternal notch inferiorly.  Attention was then turned to performing the level 1 dissection on the left.  Subsequently the marginal mandibular nerve was identified over the facial notch of the mandible.  The facial artery and vein were individually ligated and marginal mandibular nerve traced superiorly and perifascial lymph nodes freed from the marginal mandibular nerve.  Level 1A lymph nodes of the submental region were dissected off the mylohyoid and digastric.  The submandibular gland was appreciated and retracted laterally.  The mylohyoid muscle appreciated.  The lingual nerve was appreciated and the submandibular ganglion was ligated.  The hypoglossal nerve was appreciated and protected and digastric tunnel was then made posteriorly and the lymph nodes posterior along the marginal mandibular nerve and into the parotid gland were then dissected and incorporated into the specimen for histopathologic analysis.  The marginal mandibular nerve stimulated at the completion of this portion of the procedure.  Attention was then turned to incising the fascia along the clavicle on the left side.  Dissection then ensued along the floor of the neck palpating a very large bulky lymph node before the neck was identified.  The brachial plexus and phrenic nerve were identified.  The internal jugular vein identified and the mass was freed from the floor of the neck with careful dissection and suture ligation of vessels.  Attention was then turned to the central neck.  The strap muscles were appreciated in the midline.  There was a large firm mass measuring approximately 3 cm that appeared to be superior to the strap musculature.  A careful dissection with incorporation of a portion of the sternal hyoid muscle in this area for a margin was then performed.  Attention was then turned to identify the carotid artery and the internal jugular vein on the left side.  This was traced inferiorly, internal jugular vein to the brachiocephalic vein.  Palpation deep to this area into the mediastinum and up against the trachea revealed a 1.5 cm lymph node mass.  Subsequently this was carefully dissected preserving the brachiocephalic vein and also the integrity of the trachea and the carotid artery and these lymph nodes were removed in full and sent for histopathologic analysis.  Attention was then turned to the right neck dissection.  A posterior flap on the right was raised to the anterior border of the trapezius.  The accessory nerve was identified in the posterior triangle and traced superiorly and inferiorly.  Attention was then turned to identifying the submandibular gland.  A digastric tunnel was performed back to the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  The fascia overlying the sternocleidomastoid muscle on the right side was incised and the omohyoid muscle was appreciated.  The omohyoid muscle was retracted inferiorly.  Penrose drain was placed around the inferior aspect of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  Subsequently the internal jugular vein was identified.  The external jugular vein ligated about 1 cm above the clavicle.  Palpation in this area and the infraclavicular region on the right revealed a firm irregular lymph node complex.  Dissection along the floor of the neck then was performed to allow for mobilization.  The transverse cervical artery and vein were individually ligated to allow full mobilization of this mass.  Tissue between the phrenic nerve and the internal jugular vein was clamped and suture ligated.  The tissue was then brought posteriorly from the trapezius muscle to the internal jugular vein and traced superiorly.  The cervical rootlets were transected after the contribution, so the phrenic nerve all the way superiorly to the skull base.  The hypoglossal nerve was identified and protected as the lymph node packet was dissected over the internal jugular vein.  The wound was copiously irrigated.  Valsalva maneuver was given.  No bleeding points identified.  The wound was then prepared for closure.  Two number 10 JPs were placed through the left supraclavicular fossa in the previous drain sites and secured with 3-0 nylon.  The wound was closed  with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl for platysma, subsequently a 4-0 running Biosyn for the skin, and Indermil.

Thoracic epidural.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, the patient was taken to the operating room, and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered with a dual-lumen tube.  Next, the patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position, and his right chest was prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  We used a #10-blade scalpel to make an incision in the skin approximately 1 fingerbreadth below the angle of the scapula.  Dissection was carried down in a muscle-sparing fashion using Bovie electrocautery.  The 5th rib was counted, and the 6th interspace was entered.  The lung was deflated.  We identified the major fissure.  We then began by freeing up the inferior pulmonary ligament, which was done with Bovie electrocautery.  Next, we used Bovie electrocautery to dissect the pleura off the lung.  The pulmonary artery branches to the right upper lobe of the lung were identified.  Of note was the fact that there was a visible, approximately 4 x 4-cm mass in the right upper lobe of the lung without any other metastatic disease palpable.  As mentioned, a combination of Bovie electrocautery and sharp dissection was used to identify the pulmonary artery branches to the right upper lobe of the lung.  Next, we began by ligating the pulmonary artery branches of the right upper lobe of the lung.  This was done with suture ligature in combination with clips.  After taking the pulmonary artery branches of the right upper lobe of the lung, we used a combination of blunt dissection and sharp dissection with Metzenbaum scissors to separate out the pulmonary vein branch of the right upper lobe of the lung.  This likewise was ligated with a 0 silk.  It was stick-tied with a 2-0 silk.  It was then divided.  Next we dissected out the bronchial branch to the right upper lobe of the lung.  A curved Glover was placed around the bronchus.  Next a TA-30 stapler was fired across the bronchus.  The bronchus was divided with a #10-blade scalpel.  The specimen was handed off.  We next performed a mediastinal lymph node dissection.  Clips were applied to the base of the feeding vessels to the lymph nodes.  We inspected for any signs of bleeding.  There was minimal bleeding.  We placed a #32-French anterior chest tube, and a #32-French posterior chest tube.  The rib space was closed with #2 Vicryl in an interrupted figure-of-eight fashion.  A flat Jackson-Pratt drain, #10 in size, was placed in the subcutaneous flap.  The muscle layer was closed with a combination of 2-0 Vicryl followed by 2-0 Vicryl, followed by 4-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular fashion.  Sterile dressing was applied.  The instrument and sponge count was correct at the end of the case.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the PACU in good condition.","surgery, mediastinal, thoracic, epidural, lymph node dissection, lymph node, artery branches, lobectomy, lung, anesthesia, bovie, electrocautery, lymph, pulmonary, branches"

Using blunt dissection radial sensory nerve was dissected and retracted out of the operative field.  Further blunt dissection exposed the radial artery, which was dissected and retracted off the trapezium.  An incision was then made across the scaphotrapezial joint distally onto the trapezium and out onto the carpometacarpal joint.  Sharp dissection exposed the trapezium, which was then morselized and removed in toto with care taken to protect the underlying flexor carpi radialis tendon.  The radial beak of the trapezoid was then osteotomized off the head of the scaphoid.  The proximal metacarpal was then fenestrated with a 4.5-mm drill bit.  Four fingers proximal to the flexion crease of the wrist a small incision was made over the FCR tendon and blunt dissection delivered the FCR tendon into this incision.  The FCR tendon was divided and this incision was closed with 4-0 nylon sutures.  Attention was returned to the trapezial wound where longitudinal traction on the FCR tendon delivered the FCR tendon into the wound.,The FCR tendon was then threaded through the fenestration in the metacarpal.  A bone anchor was then placed distal to the metacarpal fenestration.  The FCR tendon was then pulled distally and the metacarpal reduced to an anatomic position.  The FCR tendon was then sutured to the metacarpal using the previously placed bone anchor.  Remaining FCR tendon was then anchovied and placed into the scaphotrapezoidal and trapezial defect.  The MP joint was brought into extension and the capsule closed using interrupted 3-0 Tycron sutures.,Attention was turned to the MCP joint where the MP joint was brought in to 15 degrees of flexion and pinned with a single 0.035 Kirschner wire.  The pin was cut at the level of the skin.,All incisions were closed with running 3-0 Prolene subcuticular stitch.,Sterile dressings were then applied.  The tourniquet was deflated.

General endotracheal anesthesia was induced.  The patient was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  An #11 blade scalpel was used to make a small infraumbilical skin incision in the midline.  The fascia was elevated between two Ochsner clamps and then incised.  A figure-of-eight stitch of 2-0 Vicryl was placed through the fascial edges.  The 11-mm port without the trocar engaged was then placed into the abdomen.  A pneumoperitoneum was established.  After an adequate pneumoperitoneum had been established, the laparoscope was inserted.  Three additional ports were placed all under direct vision.  An 11-mm port was placed in the epigastric area.  Two 5-mm ports were placed in the right upper quadrant.  The patient was placed in reverse Trendelenburg position and slightly rotated to the left.  The fundus of the gallbladder was retracted superiorly and laterally.  The infundibulum was retracted inferiorly and laterally.  Electrocautery was used to carefully begin dissection of the peritoneum down around the base of the gallbladder.  The triangle of Calot was carefully opened up.  The cystic duct was identified heading up into the base of the gallbladder.  The cystic artery was also identified within the triangle of Calot.  After the triangle of Calot had been carefully dissected, a clip was then placed high up on the cystic duct near its junction with the gallbladder.  The cystic artery was clipped twice proximally and once distally.  Scissors were then introduced and used to make a small ductotomy in the cystic duct, and the cystic artery was divided.  An intraoperative cholangiogram was obtained.  This revealed good flow through the cystic duct and into the common bile duct.  There was good flow into the duodenum without any filling defects.  The hepatic radicals were clearly visualized.  The cholangiocatheter was removed, and two clips were then placed distal to the ductotomy on the cystic duct.  The cystic duct was then divided using scissors.  The gallbladder was then removed up away from the liver bed using electrocautery.  The gallbladder was easily removed through the epigastric port site.  The liver bed was then irrigated and suctioned.  All dissection areas were inspected.  They were hemostatic.  There was not any bile leakage.  All clips were in place.  The right gutter up over the edge of the liver was likewise irrigated and suctioned until dry.  All ports were then removed under direct vision.  The abdominal cavity was allowed to deflate.  The fascia at the epigastric port site was closed with a stitch of 2-0 Vicryl.  The fascia at the umbilical port was closed by tying the previously placed stitch.  All skin incisions were then closed with subcuticular sutures of 4-0 Monocryl and 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine was infiltrated into all port sites.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.

She came in with severe traumatic brain injury and severe multiple fractures of the right side of the skull.  I took her to the operating a few days ago for a large right-sided hemicraniectomy to save her life.  I spoke with the family, the mom, especially about the risks, benefits, and alternatives of this procedure, most especially given the fact that she had undergone a very severe traumatic brain injury with a very poor GCS of 3 in some brainstem reflexes.  I discussed with them that this was a life-saving procedure and the family agreed to proceed with surgery as a level 1.  We went to the operating room at that time and we did a very large right-sided hemicraniectomy.  The patient was put in the intensive care unit.  We had placed also at that time a left-sided intracranial pressure monitor both which we took out a few days ago.  Over the last few days, the patient began to slowly deteriorate little bit on her clinical examination, that is, she was at first localizing briskly with the right side and that began to be less brisk.  We obtained a CT scan at this point, and we noted that she had a fair amount of swelling in the left hemisphere with about 1.5 cm of midline shift.  At this point, once again I discussed with the family the possibility of trying to save her life and go ahead and doing a left-sided very large hemicraniectomy with this __________  this was once again a life-saving procedure and we proceeded with the consent of mom to go ahead and do a level 1 hemicraniectomy of the left side.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room.  She was already intubated and under general anesthesia.  The head was put in a 3-pin Mayfield headholder with one pin in the forehead and two pins in the back to be able to put the patient with the right-hand side down and the left-hand side up since on the right-hand side, she did not have a bone flap which complicated matters a little bit, so we had to use a 3-pin Mayfield headholder.  The patient tolerated this well.  We sterilely prepped everything and we actually had already done a midline incision prior to this for the prior surgery, so we incorporated this incision into the new incision, and to be able to open the skin on the left side, we did a T-shaped incision with T vertical portion coming from anterior to the ear from the zygoma up towards the vertex of the skull towards the midline of the skin.  We connected this.  Prior to this, we brought in all surgical instrumentation under sterile and standard conditions.  We opened the skin as in opening a book and then we also did a myocutaneous flap.  We brought in the muscle with it.  We had a very good exposure of the skull.  We identified all the important landmarks including the zygoma inferiorly, the superior sagittal suture as well as posteriorly and anteriorly.  We had very good landmarks, so we went ahead and did one bur hole and the middle puncta right above the zygoma and then brought in the craniotome and did a very large bone flap that measured about 7 x 9 cm roughly, a very large decompression of the left side.  At this point, we opened the dura and the dura as soon as it was opened, there was a small subdural hematoma under a fair amount of pressure and cleaned this very nicely irrigated completely the brain and had a few contusions over the operculum as well as posteriorly.  All this was irrigated thoroughly.  Once we made sure we had absolutely great hemostasis without any complications, we went ahead and irrigated once again and we had controlled the meddle meningeal as well as the superior temporal artery very nicely.  We had absolutely good hemostasis.  We put a piece of Gelfoam over the brain.  We had opened the dura in a cruciate fashion, and the brain clearly bulging out despite of the fact that it was in the dependent position.  I went ahead and  irrigated everything thoroughly putting a piece of DuraGen as well as a piece of Gelfoam with very good hemostasis and proceeded to close the skin with running nylon in place.  This running nylon we put in place in order not to put any absorbables, although I put a few 0 popoffs just to approximate the skin nicely.  Once we had done this, irrigated thoroughly once again the skin.  We cleaned up everything and then we took the patient off __________ anesthesia and took the patient back to the intensive care unit.  The EBL was about 200 cubic centimeters.  Her hematocrit went down to about 21 and I ordered the patient to receive one unit of blood intraoperatively which they began to work on as we began to continue to do the work and the sponges and the needle counts were correct.  No complications.  The patient went back to the intensive care unit.","surgery, large hemicraniectomy, intracranial pressure, multiple fractures, skull, traumatic brain injury, mayfield headholder, injury, hemicraniectomyNOTE"

The patient recently underwent a fistulogram with angioplasty at the proximal upper arm cephalic vein due to a stenosis detected on Duplex ultrasound.  The patient subsequently was noted to have poor flow to the fistula, and the fistula was difficult to palpate.  A repeat ultrasound was performed which demonstrated a high-grade stenosis involving the distal upper arm cephalic vein just distal to the brachial anastomosis.  The patient presents today for a left arm fistulogram with angioplasty.  The risks, benefits, and alternatives of the procedure were discussed with the patient and understands and in agreement to proceed.,PROCEDURE DETAILS:  ,The patient was brought to the angio suite and laid supine on the table.  After sedation was administered, the left arm was then prepped and draped in a standard surgical fashion.  Continuous pulse oximetry and cardiac monitoring were performed throughout the procedure.  The patient was given 1 g of IV Ancef prior to incision.,The left brachiocephalic fistula was visualized with bevel ultrasound.  The cephalic vein in the proximal upper arm region appeared to be of adequate caliber.  There was an area of stenosis at the proximal cephalic vein just distal to the brachial artery anastomosis.  The cephalic vein in the proximal forearm region was easily compressible.  The skin overlying the vessel was injected with 1% lidocaine solution.  A small incision was made with the #11 blade.  The cephalic vein then was cannulated with a 5 French micropuncture introducer sheath.  The sheath was advanced over the wire.  A fistulogram was performed which demonstrated a high-grade stenosis just distal to the brachial artery anastomosis.  The introducer sheath was then exchanged for a 5 French sheath over a 0.025 guide wire.  The sheath was aspirated and flushed with heparinized saline solution.  A 0.025 glidewire was then obtained and advanced, placed over the sheath and across the area of stenosis into the brachial artery.  A 5 French short Kumpe catheter was used to guide the wire into the distal brachial and radial artery.  After crossing the area of stenosis, a 5 x 20 mm standard angioplasty balloon was obtained and prepped from the back table.  This was placed over the glidewire into the area of stenosis and inflated to 14 mmHg pressure and then deflated.  The balloon was then removed over the wire and repeat fistulogram was performed which demonstrated significant improvement.  However, there is still a remainder of residual stenosis.  The 5-mm balloon was placed over the wire again and a repeat angioplasty was performed.  The balloon was then removed over the wire and a repeat angiogram was performed which demonstrated again an area of stenosis right at the anastomosis.  The glidewire was removed and a 0.014 guide wire was then obtained and placed through the sheath and across the brachial anastomosis and into the radial artery.  A 4 x 20 mm cutting balloon was obtained and prepped on the back table.  The 5 French sheath was then exchanged for a 6 French sheath.  The balloon was then placed over the 0.014 guide wire into the area of stenosis and then inflated to normal pressures at 8 mmHg.  The balloon was then deflated and removed over the wire.  A 5 mm x 20 mm balloon was obtained and prepped and placed over the wire into the area of stenosis and inflated to pressures of 14 mmHg.  A repeat fistulogram was performed after the removal of the balloon which demonstrated excellent results with no significant residual stenosis.  The patient actually had a nice palpable thrill at this point.  The fistulogram of the distal cephalic vein at the subclavian anastomosis was performed which demonstrated a mild area of stenosis.  The sheath was removed and blood pressure was held over the puncture site for approximately 10 minutes.,After hemostasis was achieved, the cephalic vein again was visualized with bevel ultrasound.  The proximal cephalic vein was then cannulated after injecting the skin overlying the vessel with a 1% lidocaine solution.  A 5 French micropuncture introducer sheath was then placed over the wire into the proximal cephalic vein.  A repeat fistulogram was performed which demonstrated an area of stenosis within the distal cephalic vein just prior to the subclavian vein confluence.  The 5 French introducer sheath was then exchanged for a 5 French sheath.  The 5 mm x 20 mm balloon was placed over a 0.035 glidewire across the area of stenosis.  The balloon was inflated to 14 mmHg.  The balloon was then deflated and a repeat fistulogram was performed through the sheath which demonstrated good results.  The sheath was then removed and blood pressure was held over the puncture site for approximately 10 minutes.  After adequate hemostasis was achieved, the area was cleansed in 2x2 and Tegaderm was applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure without any complications.  I was present for the entire case.  The sponge, instrument, and needle counts are correct at the end of the case.  The patient was subsequently taken to PACU in stable condition.,ANGIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS:,  The initial left arm brachiocephalic fistulogram demonstrated a stenosis at the brachial artery anastomosis and distally within the cephalic vein.  After standard balloon angioplasty, there was a mild improvement but some residual area of stenosis remained at the anastomosis.  Then postcutting balloon angioplasty, venogram demonstrated a significant improvement without any evidence of significant stenosis.,Fistulogram of the proximal cephalic vein demonstrated a stenosis just prior to the confluence with the left subclavian vein.  Postangioplasty demonstrated excellent results with the standard balloon.  There was no evidence of any contrast extravasation.,IMPRESSION,1.

She has underwent sinus surgery in the past approximately 12 years ago with the CT evaluation revealed evidence of chronic mucosal thickening within the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses as well as the presence of polyposis within the nasal cavities bilaterally.,PROCEDURE:  ,After all risks, benefits, and alternatives have been discussed with the patient in detail, informed consent was obtained.  The patient was brought to the operative suite where she was placed in supine position and general anesthesia was delivered by the Department of Anesthesia.  The patient was rotated 90 degrees away where cotton pledgets saturated with 4 cc of 10% cocaine solution were inserted into the nasal cavity.  The nasal septum, as well as the turbinates were then localized with a mixture of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine solution.  The patient was then prepped and draped in the usual fashion.,Attention was directed first to the left nasal cavity.  A zero-degree sinus endoscope was inserted into the nasal cavity down to the level of the nasopharynx.  The initial examination revealed a gross polypoid disease emanating from the sphenoid sinuses as well as off the supreme turbinate.  There was also polypoid disease present within the left middle meatus.  Nasopharynx was visualized with a patent eustachian tube.  At this point, the XPS micro debrider was used to take down all the polyps emanating from the inferior surface of the left middle turbinate as well as from the supreme turbinate.  The ostium to the sphenoid sinus was visualized and was not entered.  At this point, the left middle turbinate was localized and then medialized with the use of a freer elevator.  A ball-tip probe was then used to localize the openings for the natural maxillary ostium.  Side-biting forceps were used to take down the uncinate process and was further taken down with the use of the microdebrider.  The opening of the maxillary sinus was visualized.  The posterior fontanelle was taken down with the use of straight line forceps.  It should be mentioned that tissue was very thick and polypoid with chronic inflammatory changes evident.  The maxillary sinus ostia was then suctioned with Olive-tip suction and maxillary wash was performed.  The remainder of the anterior ethmoid was then cleaned again removing excess polypoid tissue.  The basal lamella was visualized and the posterior ethmoid air cells were then entered with use of the microdebrider as the surgical assistant palpated the patient's eyes for any vibration.  All polypoid tissue was collected in the microdebrider and sent as a surgical specimen.  Once all polypoid tissue has been removed, the cocaine pledgets were reinserted into the ethmoid air cells for hemostatic purposes.  Attention was then directed to the right nasal cavity.  Again, a sinus endoscope was inserted.  Inspection revealed a grossly hypertrophied turbinate.  It was felt that this enlarged and polypoid turbinate was contributing the patient's symptoms.  Therefore, the turbinate was localized and a hemostat was used to crush the mid portion of the turbinate, which was then resected with use of side-biting scissors as well the Takahashi forceps.  Sinus endoscope was then inserted all the way down through the nasopharynx.  Again, the eustachian tube was visualized without any obstructing lesions or masses.  Upon retraction, there was again polypoid tissue noted within the ethmoid sinuses.  The ball-tip probe was again used to locate the right maxillary ostium.  The side-biting forceps was used further take down the uncinate process.  The maxillary ostium was then widened with use of a XPS microdebrider.  A maxillary sinus wash was then performed.  Now, the attention was directed to the ethmoid air cells.  It should be mentioned again that the tissue of the anterior ethmoid was very thickened and polypoid.  This was again taken down with the use of XPS microdebrider while the surgical assistant carefully palpated the patient's eye.,Once all polypoid tissue have been removed, some bleeding that was encountered was controlled with the use of suction cautery in a very conservative manner.  Once all bleeding has been controlled, all surgical instruments were removed and Merocel packing was placed in the bilateral nasal cavities with the intent to remove in the recovery room.  At this point, the procedure was felt to be complete.  The patient was awakened and taken to the recovery room without incident.","surgery, endoscopic sinus surgery, maxillary antrostomy, ethmoidectomy, nasal polypectomy, turbinate reduction, sinus surgery, sinus endoscope, maxillary sinus, nasal cavity, polypoid tissue, sinus, maxillary, turbinate, polypoid, nasal, total, ostium, microdebrider,"

Status post orbitozygomatic resection of a pituitary tumor with a very large intracranial component basically a very large skull-based brain tumor., Surgery,1, Craniotomy ,"TITLE OF OPERATION: , Right-sided craniotomy for evacuation of a right frontal intracranial hemorrhage.,INDICATION FOR SURGERY: , The patient is very well known to our service.  In brief, the patient is status post orbitozygomatic resection of a pituitary tumor with a very large intracranial component basically a very large skull-based brain tumor.  He was taken to the operating room for the orbitozygomatic approach.  Intraoperatively, everything went well without any complications.  The brain at the end of the procedure was absolutely intact, but the patient developed a seizure in the Intensive Care Unit and then was taken to the CT scan, developed a second seizure.  He was given Ativan for this, and then began to identify a large component measuring about 3 x 3 cm of the right frontal lobe, what appeared to be a hemorrhagic conversion of potential venous infarct.  I had a long discussion immediately with Dr. X and Dr. Y.  We decided to take the patient immediately as a level 1 for evacuation of this hematoma with a small amount of a midline shift with an intraventricular component.  It worried me and I think that we needed to go ahead and take him to the operating room immediately.  The patient was taken as a level 1 immediately and emergently and into the operating room for this procedure.  The original plan was to do first a right-sided orbitozygomatic procedure and then stage it a few weeks later with an endonasal endoscopic procedure for resection of this pituitary tumor component.  He was taken to the operating room for evacuation of a right frontal intraparenchymal hematoma.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS:,  Pituitary tumor with a large intracranial component, status post resection and now development of an intracranial hemorrhage.,POSTOP DIAGNOSIS:,  Intracranial hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe with extension into the intraventricular space after resection of a pituitary tumor via orbitozygomatic approach.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room.  In the supine position, his head was put in a horseshoe without any complications.  The patient tolerated this very well, and the prior incision was immediately opened.  The surgery had taken place a few hours prior to this, the original orbitozygomatic approach.  At this point, this was a life-saving procedure.  We went ahead, opened the old incision after everything was sterilely prepped, and all the surgical instrumentation was brought into place.  We went ahead and opened the incision and took out the pterional bone flap without any complications.  We immediately opened the dura expeditiously, and the brain was moderately under some pressure, but not really bulging out.  So I went ahead and identified an area over the right frontal lobe that was a little bit consistent with a hemorrhagic infarct and nonviable tissue.  So we went ahead and did a corticectomy right there and identified the actual clot immediately and went ahead, and over the next few hours, very meticulously began to evacuate these clots without any complication whatsoever.  We went all the way down to the ventricle and identified this clot in the ventricle and went ahead and removed this clot without any complications, and we had a very nice resection.  The brain was very relaxed.  We had a very good resection of the actual blood clot, and the brain was very relaxed.  We irrigated thoroughly.  We identified the ventricles.  We went ahead and did a very careful hemostasis with Avitene with thrombin and Gelfoam with thrombin over the next times in doing the procedure.  All this was done very well, and then we lined the cavity with Surgicel, and the Surgicel was only put at the edge and draping down as to not to leave any fragments potentially to communicate with the actual ventricle, and then after this, everything was good.  We went ahead and closed back the actual dura back.  We had done a pericranial flap.  This was also put back in place and the dura was closed with 4-0 Surgilons.  We reconstructed everything.  The frontal sinus was reconstructed thoroughly without any complications.  We went ahead and put once again a watertight closure and went ahead and put another piece of DuraGen with Hemaseel in place, and went ahead and put the bone flap back and reconstructed very nicely once again with self-tapping, self-drilling screws, low-profile plates.  Once everything was confirmed to be in place, we went ahead and closed the muscle flap and also the actual fat pad was put back into place and closed together with 0 pop-offs, and the skin with staples without any complications.  In summary, the procedure was going back to the operating room for evacuation of a right-sided intracranial hemorrhage, most likely a conversion of an intraparenchymal hematoma with extension into the ventricle without any complications.  So everything was stable.  Estimated blood loss was about 100 cubic centimeters.  The sponges and needle counts were correct.  No specimens were sent to pathology.,DISPOSITION: , The patient after this procedure was brought to the Neuro Intensive Care Unit for close observation.","surgery, orbitozygomatic, intracranial, brain tumor, intraparenchymal hematoma, orbitozygomatic approach, frontal lobe, intracranial hemorrhage, pituitary tumor, craniotomy, hemorrhage,"

Consideration given to completion thyroidectomy.  Risks, benefits, and alternatives of this procedure was discussed with the patient in great detail.  Risks included but were not limited to anesthesia, bleeding, infection, injury to nerves including vocal fold paralysis, hoarseness, low calcium, scar, cosmetic deformity, need for thyroid hormone replacement, and also need for further management.  The patient understood all of this and then wished to proceed.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS:,  Multifocal thyroid carcinoma and previous left thyroid lobectomy resection specimen.,POSTOP DIAGNOSIS: , Multifocal thyroid carcinoma and previous left thyroid lobectomy resection specimen.,PROCEDURE DETAIL:,  After identifying the patient, the patient was placed supine in the operating room table.  After establishment of general anesthesia via orotracheal intubation with a number 6 nerve integrity monitoring system endotracheal tube, the eyes were protected with Tegaderm.  Nerve integrity monitoring system endotracheal tube was confirmed to be working adequately and secured.  The previous skin incision for a thyroidectomy was then planned, then incorporated into an ellipse.  The patient was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  Subsequently, the ellipse around the previous incision was deformed.  The scar was then excised.  Subplatysmal flaps were raised to the thyroid notch and sternal notch respectively.  Strap muscles were isolated in the midline and dissected and mobilized from the thyroid lobe on the right side.  There was some dense fibrosis and inflammation surrounding the right thyroid lobe.  Careful dissection along the thyroid lobe allowed for identification of the superior thyroid artery and vein which were individually ligated with a Harmonic scalpel.  The right inferior and superior parathyroid glands were identified and preserved and recurrent laryngeal nerve was identified and traced superiorly, then preserved.  Of note is that there were multiple lymph nodes in the paratracheal region on the right side.  These lymph nodes were carefully dissected away from the recurrent laryngeal nerve, trachea, and the carotid artery, and sent as a separate specimen labeled right paratracheal lymph nodes.  The wound was copiously irrigated.  Valsalva maneuver was given.  Surgicel was placed in the wound bed.  Strap muscles were reapproximated in the midline with 3-0 Vicryl and incision was then closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl and Indermil for the skin.  The patient was extubated in the operating room table, sent to the postanesthesia care unit in good condition.","surgery, multifocal thyroid carcinoma, thyroid lobectomy, thyroid, papillary, thyroid lobe, isthmus, completion thyroidectomy, thyroidectomy, paratracheal, lobectomy, "

", Surgery,1, Aortogram - Leg claudication. ,"PREPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS:,  Left leg claudication.,POSTPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: ,  Left leg claudication.,OPERATION PERFORMED: , Aortogram with bilateral, segmental lower extremity run off.,ANESTHESIA: , Conscious sedation.,INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE:  ,The patient presents with lower extremity claudication.  She is a 68-year-old woman, who is very fearful of the aforementioned procedures.  Risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to her to include bleeding, infection, arterial trauma requiring surgery, access issues and recurrence.  She appears to understand and agrees to proceed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the Angio Suite, placed in a supine position.  After adequate conscious sedation, both groins were prepped with Chloraseptic prep.  Cloth towels and paper drapes were placed.  Local anesthesia was administered in the common femoral artery and using ultrasound guidance, the common femoral artery was accessed.  Guidewire was threaded followed by a ,4-French sheath.  Through the 4-French sheath a 4-French Omni flush catheter was placed.  The glidewire was removed and contrast administered to identify the level of the renal artery.  Using power injector an aortogram proceeded.,The catheter was then pulled down to the aortic bifurcation.  A timed run-off view of both legs was performed and due to a very abnormal and delayed run-off in the left, I opted to perform an angiogram of the left lower extremity with an isolated approach.  The catheter was pulled down to the aortic bifurcation and using a glidewire, I obtained access to the contralateral left external iliac artery.  The Omni flush catheter was advanced to the left distal external iliac artery.  The glidewire rather exchanged for an Amplatz stiff wire.  This was left in place and the 4-French sheath removed and replaced with a 6-French destination 45-cm sheath.  This was advanced into the proximal superficial femoral artery and an angiogram performed.  I identified a functionally occluded distal superficial femoral artery and after obtaining views of the run off made plans for angioplasty.,The patient was given 5000 units of heparin and this was allowed to circulate.  A glidewire was carefully advanced using Roadmapping techniques through the functionally occluded blood vessels.  A 4-mm x 4-cm angioplasty balloon was used to dilate the area in question.,Final views after dilatation revealed a dissection.  A search for a 5-mm stent was performed, but none of this was available.  For this reason, I used a 6-mm x 80-mm marked stent and placed this at the distal superficial femoral artery.  Post dilatation was performed with a 4-mm angioplasty balloon.  Further views of the left lower extremity showed irregular change in the popliteal artery.  No significant stenosis could be identified in the left popliteal artery and noninvasive scan.  For this reason, I chose not to treat any further areas in the left leg.,I then performed closure of the right femoral artery with a 6-French Angio-Seal device.  Attention was turned to the left femoral artery and local anesthesia administered.  Access was obtained with the ultrasound and the femoral artery identified.  Guidewire was threaded followed by a 4-French sheath.  This was immediately exchanged for the 6-French destination sheath after the glidewire was used to access the distal external iliac artery.  The glidewire was exchanged for the Amplatz stiff wire to place the destination sheath.  The destination was placed in the proximal superficial femoral artery and angiogram obtained.  Initial views had been obtained from the right femoral sheath before removal.,Views of the right superficial femoral artery demonstrated significant stenosis with accelerated velocities in the popliteal and superficial femoral artery.  For this reason, I performed the angioplasty of the superficial femoral artery using the 4-mm balloon.  A minimal dissection plane measuring less than 1 cm was identified at the proximal area of dilatation.  No further significant abnormality was identified.  To avoid placing a stent in the small vessel I left it alone and approached the popliteal artery.  A 3-mm balloon was chosen to dilate a 50 to 79% popliteal artery stenosis.  Reasonable use were obtained and possibly a 4-mm balloon could have been used.  However, due to her propensity for dissection I opted not to.  I then exchanged the glidewire for an O1 for Thruway guidewire using an exchange length.  This was placed into the left posterior tibial artery.  A 2-mm balloon was used to dilate the orifice of the posterior tibial artery.  I then moved the wire to the perineal artery and dilated the proximal aspect of this vessel.  Final images showed improved run-off to the right calf.  The destination sheath was pulled back into the left external iliac artery and an Angio-Seal deployed.,FINDINGS: , Aortogram demonstrates a dual right renal artery with the inferior renal artery supplying the lower one third of the right renal parenchyma.  No evidence of renal artery stenosis is noted bilaterally.  There is a single left renal artery.  The infrarenal aorta, both common iliac and the external iliac arteries are normal.  On the right, a superficial femoral artery is widely patent and normal proximally.  At the distal third of the thigh there is diffuse disease with moderate stenosis noted.  Moderate stenosis is also noted in the popliteal artery and single vessel run-off through the posterior tibial artery is noted.  The perineal artery is functionally occluded at the midcalf.  The dorsal pedal artery filled by collateral at the high ankle level.,On the left, the proximal superficial femoral artery is patent.  Again, at the distal third of the thigh, there is a functional occlusion of the superficial femoral artery with poor collateralization to the high popliteal artery.  This was successfully treated with angioplasty and a stent placement.  The popliteal artery is diffusely diseased without focal stenosis.  The tibioperoneal trunk is patent and the anterior tibial artery occluded at its orifice.,IMPRESSION,1.  Normal bilateral renal arteries with a small accessory right renal artery.,2.

The patient has diabetes and is morbidly obese.,PROCEDURES: , Aortic valve replacement using a mechanical valve and two-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting procedure using saphenous vein graft to the first obtuse marginal artery and left radial artery graft to the left anterior descending artery.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal,INCISION: , Median sternotomy,INDICATIONS: , The patient presented with severe congestive heart failure associated with the patient's severe diabetes.  The patient was found to have moderately stenotic aortic valve.  In addition, The patient had significant coronary artery disease consisting of a chronically occluded right coronary artery but a very important large obtuse marginal artery coming off as the main circumflex system.  The patient also has a left anterior descending artery which has moderate disease and this supplies quite a bit of collateral to the patient's right system.  It was decided to perform a valve replacement as well as coronary artery bypass grafting procedure.,FINDINGS: , The left ventricle is certainly hypertrophied¬∑ The aortic valve leaflet is calcified and a severe restrictive leaflet motion.  It is a tricuspid type of valve.  The coronary artery consists of a large left anterior descending artery which is associated with 60% stenosis but a large obtuse marginal artery which has a tight proximal stenosis.,The radial artery was used for the left anterior descending artery.  Flow was excellent.  Looking at the targets in the posterior descending artery territory, there did not appear to be any large branches.  On the angiogram these vessels appeared to be quite small.  Because this is a chronically occluded vessel and the patient has limited conduit due to the patient's massive obesity, attempt to bypass to this area was not undertaken.  The patient was brought to the operating room,PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in supine position.  A median sternotomy incision was carried out and conduits were taken from the left arm as well as the right thigh.  The patient weighs nearly three hundred pounds.  There was concern as to taking down the left internal mammary artery.  Because the radial artery appeared to be a good conduit The patient would have arterial graft to the left anterior descending artery territory.  The patient was cannulated after the aorta and atrium were exposed and full heparinization.,The patient went on cardiopulmonary bypass and the aortic cross-clamp was applied Cardioplegia was delivered through the coronary sinuses in a retrograde manner.  The patient was cooled to 32 degrees.  Iced slush was applied to the heart.  The aortic valve was then exposed through the aortic root by transverse incision.  The valve leaflets were removed and the #23 St. Jude mechanical valve was secured into position by circumferential pledgeted sutures.  At this point, aortotomy was closed.,The first obtuse marginal artery was a very large target and the vein graft to this target indeed produced an excellent amount of flow.  Proximal anastomosis was then carried out to the foot of the aorta.  The left anterior descending artery does not have severe disease but is also a very good target and the radial artery was anastomosed to this target in an end-to-side manner.  The two proximal anastomoses were then carried out to the root of the aorta.,The patient came off cardiopulmonary bypass after aortic cross-clamp was released.  The patient was adequately warmed.  Protamine was given without adverse effect.  Sternal closure was then done using wires.  The subcutaneous layers were closed using Vicryl suture.  The skin was approximated using staples.","surgery, coronary artery bypass grafting, saphenous vein graft, radial artery graft, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, descending artery territory, aortic cross clamp, aortic valve replacement, coronary artery bypass, obtuse marginal artery, anterior descending artery, mechanical valve, artery bypass, bypass grafting, marginal artery, radial artery, aortic valve, coronary artery, anterior descending, descending artery, valve, artery, aortic, grafting,"

We decided go ahead with anterior cervical discectomy at C5-C6 and fusion.  The risks of lack of pain relief, paralysis, hoarse voice, nerve injuries, and infection were explained and the patient agreed to proceed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room where a general endotracheal anesthesia was induced without complication.  The patient was placed in the slightly extended position with the neck and the head was restrained in a doughnut and the occiput was restrained by the doughnut.  He had tape placed over the shoulders during intraoperative x-rays and his elbows were well padded.  The tape was placed and his arms were well padded.  He was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  A linear incision was fashioned at the cricothyroid level from near the midline to over the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  We separated the platysma from the subcutaneous tissue and then opened the platysma along the medial border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  We then dissected sharply medial to carotid artery, which we palpated to the prevertebral region.  We placed Caspar retractors for medial and lateral exposure over the C5-C6 disc space, which we confirmed with the lateral cervical spine x-ray including 18-gauge needle in the disc space.  We then marked the disc space.  We then drilled off ventral osteophyte as well as osteophyte creating concavity within the disc space.  We then under magnification removed all the disc material, we could possibly see down to bleeding bone and both the endplates.  We took down posterior longitudinal ligament as well.  We incised the 6-mm cornerstone bone.  We placed a 6-mm parallel medium bone nicely into the disc space.  We then sized a 23-mm plate.  We inserted the screws nicely above and below.  We tightened down the lock-nuts.  We irrigated the wound.  We assured hemostasis using bone wax prior to placing the plate.  We then assured hemostasis once again.  We reapproximated the platysma using 3-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted fashion.  The subcutaneous level was closed using 3-0 Vicryl in a simple buried fashion.  The skin was closed with 3-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular stitch.  Steri-Strips were applied.  Dry sterile dressing with Telfa was applied over this.  We obtained an intraoperative x-ray to confirm the proper level and good position of both plates and screw construct on the lateral x-ray and the patient was transferred to the recovery room, moving all four extremities with stable vital signs.  I was present as a primary surgeon throughout the entire case.","surgery, allograft fusion, anterior cervical discectomy, neck pain, cervical spine, discectomy, fusion, sternocleidomastoid muscle, assured hemostasis, anterior cervical, cervical discectomy, disc space, cervical, anterior, allograft"
927,1197,1265, The Ahmed shunt was primed and placed in the superior temporal quadrant and it was sutured in place with two 8-0 nylon sutures.  The knots were trimmed. , Surgery,3, Ahmed Shunt Placement ,"PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,While in the holding area, the patient received a peripheral IV from the nursing staff.  In addition, pilocarpine 1% was placed into the operative eye, two times, separated by 10 minutes.  The patient was wheeled to the operating suite where the anesthesia team established peripheral monitoring lines.  Through the IV, the patient received IV sedation in the form of propofol and once somnolent from this, a retrobulbar block was administrated consisting of 2% Xylocaine plain.  Approximately 3 mL were administered.  The patient then underwent a Betadine prep with respect to the face, lens, lashes, and eye.  During the draping process, care was taken to isolate the lashes.  A Vicryl traction suture was placed through the superior cornea and the eye was reflected downward to expose the superior temporal conjunctiva.  Approximately 8 to 10 mm posterior to limbus, the conjunctiva was incised and dissected forward to the limbus.  Blunt dissection was carried out in the superotemporal quadrant.  Next, a 2 x 3-mm scleral flap was outlined that was one-half scleral depth in thickness.  This flap was cut forward to clear cornea using a crescent blade.  The Ahmed shunt was then primed and placed in the superior temporal quadrant and it was sutured in place with two 8-0 nylon sutures.  The knots were trimmed.  The tube was then cut to an appropriate length to enter the anterior chamber.  The anterior chamber was then entered after a paracentesis wound had been made temporally.  A trabeculectomy was done and then the tube was threaded through the trabeculectomy site.  The tube was sutured in place with a multi-wrapped 8-0 nylon suture.  The scleral flap was then sutured in place with two 10-0 nylon sutures.  The knots were trimmed, rotated and buried.  A scleral patch was then placed of an appropriate size over the two.  It was sutured in place with interrupted 8-0 nylon sutures.  The knots were trimmed.  The overlying conjunctiva was then closed with a running 8-0 Vicryl suture with a BV needle.  The anterior chamber was filled with Viscoat to keep it deep as the eye was somewhat soft.  A good flow was established with irrigation into the anterior chamber.  Homatropine, Econopred, and Vigamox drops were placed into the eye.  A patch and shield were placed over the eye after removing the draping and the speculum.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  He was taken to the recovery in good condition.  He will be seen in followup in the office tomorrow.","surgery, cornea, ahmed shunt, nylon sutures, trabeculectomy, conjunctiva, chamberNOTE,: Thesetranscribed medical transcription sample reports and examples are provided by various users andare for reference purpose only.

The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  An incision was made in the groin crease overlying the internal ring.  This incision was about 1.5 cm in length.  The incision was carried down through the Scarpa's layer to the level of the external oblique.  This was opened along the direction of its fibers and carried down along the external spermatic fascia.  The cremasteric fascia was then incised and the internal spermatic fascia was grasped and pulled free.  A hernia sac was identified and the testicle was located.  Next the internal spermatic fascia was incised and the hernia sac was dissected free inside the internal ring.  This was performed by incising the transversalis fascia circumferentially.  The hernia sac was ligated with a 3-0 silk suture high and divided and was noted to retract into the abdominal cavity.  Care was taken not to injure the testicular vessels.  Next the abnormal attachments of the testicle were dissected free distally with care not to injure any long loop vas and these were divided beneath the testicle for a fair distance.  The lateral attachments tethering the cord vessels were freed from the sidewalls in the retroperitoneum high.  This gave excellent length and very adequate length to bring the testicle down into the anterior superior hemiscrotum.  The testicle was viable.  This was wrapped in a moist sponge.,Next a hemostat was passed down through the inguinal canal down into the scrotum.  A small 1 cm incision was made in the anterior superior scrotal wall.  Dissection was carried down through the dartos layer.  A subdartos pouch was formed with blunt dissection.  The hemostat was then pushed against the tissues and this tissue was divided.  The hemostat was then passed through the incision.  A Crile hemostat was passed back up into the inguinal canal.  The distal attachments of the sac were grasped and pulled down without twisting these structures through the incision.  The neck was then closed with a 4-0 Vicryl suture that was not too tight, but tight enough to prevent retraction of the testicle.  The testicle was then tucked down in its proper orientation into the subdartos pouch and the subcuticular tissue was closed with a running 4-0 chromic and the skin was closed with a running 6-0 subcuticular chromic suture.  Benzoin and a Steri-Strip were placed.  Next the transversus abdominis arch was reapproximated to the iliopubic tract over the top of the cord vessels to tighten up the ring slightly.

General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.,A standard inguinal incision was made and dissection was carried down to the external oblique aponeurosis using a combination of Metzenbaum scissors and Bovie electrocautery.  The external oblique aponeurosis was cleared of overlying adherent tissue, and the external ring was delineated.  The external oblique was then incised with a scalpel, and this incision was carried out to the external ring using Metzenbaum scissors.  Having exposed the inguinal canal, the cord structures were separated from the canal using blunt dissection, and a Penrose drain was placed around the cord structures at the level of the pubic tubercle.  This Penrose drain was then used to retract the cord structures as needed.  Adherent cremasteric muscle was dissected free from the cord using Bovie electrocautery.,The cord was then explored using a combination of sharp and blunt dissection, and the sac was found anteromedially to the cord structures.  The sac was dissected free from the cord structures using a combination of blunt dissection and Bovie electrocautery.  Once preperitoneal fat was encountered, the dissection stopped and the sac was suture ligated at the level of the preperitoneal fat using a 2-0 silk suture ligature.  The sac was excised and went to  Pathology.  The ends of the suture were then cut and the stump retracted back into the abdomen.,The Penrose drain was removed.  The wound was then irrigated using sterile saline, and hemostasis was obtained using Bovie electrocautery.  The incision in the external oblique was approximated using a 3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion, thus reforming the external ring.  The skin incision was approximated with 4-0 Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion.  The skin was prepped and draped with benzoin, and Steri-Strips were applied.  A dressing consisting of a 2 x 2 and OpSite was then applied.  All surgical counts were reported as correct.,Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently extubated and taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition.","urology, inguinal canal, cremasteric muscle, pubic tubercl, inguinal herniorrhaphy, blunt dissection, penrose drain, bovie electrocautery, cord structures, inguinal, electrocautery, cord"

Alternative therapies including radiation therapy; either radioactive seed placement, conformal radiation therapy, or the HDR radiation treatments were discussed with the risks of bladder, bowel, and rectal injury and possible impotence were discussed also.  There is a risk of rectal fistula.  Hormonal therapy is usually added to the radiation therapy options and this has the risk of osteoporosis, gynecomastia, hot flashes and impotency.  Potency may not recover after the hormone therapy has been completed.  Cryosurgery was discussed with the risks of urinary retention, stricture formation, incontinence and impotency.  There is a risk of rectal fistula.  He would need to have a suprapubic catheter for about two weeks and may need to learn self-intermittent catheterization if he cannot void adequately.  Prostate surgery to relieve obstruction and retention after radioactive seeds or cryosurgery has a higher risk of urinary incontinence.  Observation therapy was discussed with him in addition.

959,1233,172, Bladder instillation for chronic interstitial cystitis., Urology,3, Bladder Instillation ,"CHIEF COMPLAINT:,  The patient comes for bladder instillation for chronic interstitial cystitis.,SUBJECTIVE:,  The patient is crying today when she arrives in the office saying that she has a lot of discomfort.  These bladder instillations do not seem to be helping her.  She feels anxious and worried.  She does not think she can take any more pain.  She is debating whether or not to go back to Dr. XYZ and ask for the nerve block or some treatment modality to stop the pain because she just cannot function on a daily basis and care for her children unless she gets something done about this, and she fears these bladder instillations because they do not seem to help.  They seem to be intensifying her pain.  She has the extra burden of each time she comes needing to have pain medication one way or another, thus then we would not allow her to drive under the influence of the pain medicine.  So, she has to have somebody come with her and that is kind of troublesome to her.  We discussed this at length.  I did suggest that it was completely appropriate for her to decide.  She will terminate these if they are that uncomfortable and do not seem to be giving her any relief, although I did tell her that occasionally people do have discomfort with them and then after the completion of the instillations, they do better and we have also had some people who have had to terminate the instillations because they were too uncomfortable and they could not stand it and they went on to have some other treatment modality.  She had Hysterectomy in the past.,MEDICATIONS: , Premarin 1.25 mg daily, Elmiron 100 mg t.i.d., Elavil 50 mg at bedtime, OxyContin 10 mg three tablets three times a day, Toprol XL 25 mg daily.,ALLERGIES:,  Compazine and Allegra.,OBJECTIVE:,Vital Signs:  Weight:  140 pounds.  Blood pressure:  132/90.  Pulse:  102.  Respirations:  18.  Age:  27.,PLAN:,  We discussed going for another evaluation by Dr. XYZ and seeking his opinion.  She said that she called him on the phone the other day and told him how miserable she was and he told her that he really thought she needed to complete.  The instillations give that a full trial and then he would be willing to see her back.  As we discussed these options and she was encouraged to think it over and decide what she would like to do for I could not makeup her mind for her.  She said she thought that it was unreasonable to quit now when she only had two or three more treatments to go, but she did indicate that the holiday weekend coming made her fearful and if she was uncomfortable after today‚Äôs instillation which she did choose to take then she would choose to cancel Friday‚Äôs appointment, also that she would not feel too badly over the holiday weekend.  I thought that was reasonable and agreed that that would work out.,PROCEDURE:,:  She was then given 10 mg of morphine subcutaneously because she did not feel she could tolerate the discomfort in the instillation without pain medicine.  We waited about 20 minutes.  The bladder was then instilled and the urethra was instilled with lidocaine gel which she tolerated and then after a 10-minute wait, the bladder was instilled with DMSO, Kenalog, heparin, and sodium bicarbonate, and the catheter was removed.  The patient retained the solution for one hour, changing position every 15 minutes and then voided to empty the bladder.  She seemed to tolerate it moderately well.  She is to call and let me know what she wishes to do about the Friday scheduled bladder instillation if she tolerated this then she is going to consider trying it.  If not, she will cancel and will start over next week or she will see Dr. Friesen.","urology, urethra, dmso, bladder, chronic interstitial cystitis, interstitial cystitis, bladder instillation, instillation, instillations,"
960,1234,176, Bilateral vasovasostomy surgery sample., Urology,3, Bilateral Vasovasostomy ,"Initially a small incision was made in the right superior hemiscrotum and the incision was carried down to the vas deferens.  This incision was carried down to the area of the previous vasectomy.  A towel clip was placed around this.  Next the scarred area was dissected free back to normal vas proximally and distally.  Approximately 4 cm of vas was freed up.  Next the vas was amputated above and below the scar tissue.  Fine hemostats were used to grasp the adventitial tissue on each side of the vas, both the proximal and distal ends.  Both ends were then dilated very carefully with lacrimal duct probes up to a #2 successfully.  After accomplishing this, fluid could be milked from the proximal vas which was encouraging.,Next the reanastomosis was performed.  Three 7-0 Prolene were used and full thickness bites were taken through the muscle layer of the vas deferens and into the lumen.  This was all done with 3.5 loupe magnification.  Next the vas ends were pulled together by tying the sutures.  A good reapproximation was noted.  Next in between each of these sutures two to three of the 7-0 Prolenes were used to reapproximate the muscularis layer further in an attempt to make this fluid-tight.,There was no tension on the anastomosis and the vas was delivered back into the right hemiscrotum.  The subcuticular layers were closed with a running 3-0 chromic and the skin was closed with three interrupted 3-0 chromic sutures.,Next an identical procedure was done on the left side.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and was awakened and returned to the recovery room in stable condition.  Antibiotic ointment, fluffs, and a scrotal support were placed.","urology, vasovasostomy, adventitial tissue, anastomosis, fluffs, hemiscrotum, loupe magnification, lumen, muscle layer, scrotal support, subcuticular, vas deferens, vas ends, bilateral vasovasostomy, chromic, suturesNOTE,: Thesetranscribed medical transcription sample reports and examples are provided by various users andare for reference purpose only.
